Crude oil prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, driven by rising global oil inventories that have resulted from slowing global oil demand growth and the accelerated unwinding of OPEC+ voluntary production cuts, which began in April. On May 31, OPEC+ members agreed to a third month of [planned production increases](https://www.opec.org/pr-detail/1360566-31-may-2025.html) in July, with the potential for revisions pending market conditions. These factors contribute to our expectation that global oil production will exceed consumption over the forecast period, causing global oil inventories to build and putting downward pressure on oil prices. We expect Brent crude oil prices will average $66/b this year and $59/b next year.\\n\\n[![Image 2: Brent crude oil spot price and global inventory changes](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_01.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_01.png)\\n\\nGlobal oil inventories increased over the first five months of 2025 and will continue to grow significantly over the forecast period. We expect they will increase by an average of 0.4 million barrels per day (b/d) for the remainder of the year. We expect global oil inventory builds will average 0.8 million b/d in 2025, 0.4 million b/d higher than in last month’s STEO. For the second half of the year, we expect that slowing global oil production growth—led by relatively flat U.S. crude oil production—and rising oil consumption growth mean builds will moderate to 0.6 million b/d next year, with markets moving towards balance.\\n\\nGlobal inventory builds in 2025 are higher in this month’s STEO than last due to a combination of lower oil demand in the OECD in 2025 and increased supply growth from both OPEC+ countries and from countries outside of the group. Although the recent OPEC+ announcement added near-term supply to oil balances in our forecast, we made additional upward revisions to our Kazakhstan production forecast to accurately account for recent production levels from the Tengiz field. We also revised our forecast for Brazil because the Bacalhau Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) vessel is set to begin earlier than we had previously assumed in our forecast.\\n\\nSignificant uncertainty remains in our price forecast. Although we do not currently forecast any major supply disruptions, oil supply risks remain. [Wildfires around Canada’s major oil sands facilities](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albertas-wildfires-disrupt-some-7-canadas-oil-production-2025-06-02/) in Alberta, elevated tensions in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well a [potential force majeure on oil exports in Libya](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/libyas-eastern-based-government-says-it-may-announce-force-majeure-oil-fields-2025-05-28/) have the potential to disrupt supply. Another source of uncertainty is the willingness and ability of OPEC+ members to coordinate future production targets in the face of falling oil prices and increasing oil supply from sources outside of OPEC+.\\n\\nIn addition, uncertainty around the status of ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and its trading partners could greatly affect oil prices. The status of sanctions on Russia and Iran remains uncertain, as does future development around Venezuelan oil assets, which have the potential to influence trade flows and affect oil prices.\\n\\n**Global oil production and consumption**\\n\\n Oil consumption growth in our forecast continues to be less than the pre-pandemic trend. Forecast global liquid fuels consumption increases by 0.8 million b/d in 2025 and 1.1 million b/d in 2026, driven primarily by demand from non-OECD countries. Total non-OECD consumption grows by 0.9 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, while OECD consumption is largely unchanged over the forecast.\\n\\n[![Image 3: annual change in world liquid fuels consumption](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_02.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_02.png)\\n\\nWe expect India will increase its consumption of liquid fuels by 0.2 million b/d in 2025 and 0.3 million b/d in 2026, compared with an increase of 0.2 million in 2024, driven by rising demand for transportation fuels. We forecast China’s liquid fuels consumption will grow by 0.2 million b/d in both 2025 and 2026, up from an increase of 0.1 million b/d in 2024.\\n\\nThe planned increases to OPEC+ production combined with supply growth outside of the group continue to drive strong global liquid fuels production growth in our forecast. Global liquid fuels production increases by 1.6 million b/d in 2025, 0.2 million b/d higher than in last month’s STEO, before increasing by 0.8 million b/d in 2026.\\n\\n[![Image 4: OPEC+ crude oil production and targets](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_03.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_03.png)\\n\\nAlthough OPEC+ recently announced its third consecutive planned monthly crude oil production increase for July 2025, we still anticipate OPEC+ members will produce below the current target path to limit increases in global oil inventories and attempt to support falling prices. We expect OPEC+ will increase its crude oil production by 0.3 million b/d this year, compared with a decrease of 1.4 million b/d in 2024, before increasing by 0.5 million b/d in 2026.\\n\\nWe expect countries outside of OPEC+ will drive global liquid fuels production growth this year, increasing production by 1.1 million b/d. However, OPEC+ drives growth next year in our forecast, as Non-OPEC+ growth in our forecast slows to 0.2 million b/d, with growth from Brazil, Guyana, and Canada being partly offset by a slight drop in U.S. production.\\n\\n| Global Petroleum and Other Liquids |\\n| --- |\\n|  | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 projected | 2026 projected |\\n| Note: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report. |\\n| Brent crude oil spot price (dollars per barrel) | 82 | 81 | 66 | 59 |\\n| Global liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 102.2 | 102.8 | 104.4 | 105.1 |\\n| OPEC liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 32.4 | 32.4 | 32.7 | 32.9 |\\n| Non-OPEC liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 69.8 | 70.4 | 71.6 | 72.2 |\\n| Global liquid fuels consumption (million barrels per day) | 101.8 | 102.7 | 103.5 | 104.6 |\\n| Global GDP (percentage change) | 3.4 | 3.2 | 2.8 | 2.9 |\\n\\n#### Interactive Data Viewers\\n\\n_Provides custom data views of historical and forecast data_\\n\\n**[STEO Data browser ›](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/)\\n\\n[Real Prices Viewer ›](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/realprices/)**\\n\\n| Related Tables |\\n| --- |\\n| [Table 2.

The agency expects global oil demand growth will come nearly to a halt in the coming years with Chinese consumption set to slow down after an initial pent-up recovery. IEA is forecasting that China’s “pent-up” oil consumption will [peak mid-2023 after a 1.5 million-barrels-per-day rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) but lose momentum to just an average of 290,000 barrels per day year-on-year from 2024 to 2028. Annual global demand growth is forecast to decline from [2.4 million barrels per day this year to 400,000 barrels per day in 2028](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html). The shift is occurring, according to IEA, because of the “clean energy transition” as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance. This IEA forecast updates its prediction in October that oil demand [would plateau by the mid-2030s](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html).\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**Fast Facts**\\n\\n*   IEA predicts that peak oil will occur in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day, 6 percent higher than last year’s demand, moving the peak date up from the mid-2030s in its earlier forecast.\\n*   IEA points to the “green energy transition” as the cause of oil demand plateauing—a concept it has been cheerleading on behalf of OECD governments.\\n*   IEA assumes that electric vehicles will represent one out of four vehicles by 2028 world-wide. \\n*   IEA predicts an 11 percent increase in investment in new oil exploration and production this year, which illustrates a gulf between IEA and those in the oil business. \\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.48.31-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.48.31-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\nThe adoption of tighter efficiency standards by government regulators, structural changes to the economy and the increasing penetration of electric vehicles are expected to moderate annual growth in oil demand throughout the forecast. The IEA assumes more than one in four cars in 2028 will be an electric vehicle, with sales near [25.9 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html). The use of gasoline for vehicles is expected to decline after 2026, given increased adoption of electric vehicles, biofuel mandates and improving fuel economy.\\n\\n[Non-OECD Asia leads oil demand growth](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf) in IEA’s forecast between 2022 and 2028. China has strong gains at the start of the forecast, but India overtakes China beginning in 2027. The OECD demand growth declines beginning in 2024.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.52.31-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.52.31-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\n**Oil Supply**\\n\\nOn the supply side, the IEA expects oil producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — known as OPEC+ — to “[dominate medium-term capacity expansion plans](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html),” including the United States, Brazil and Guyana. Global supply capacity is expected to increase by [5.9 million barrels per day to 111 million barrels per day by 2028](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html), and result in a spare capacity cushion of [3.8 million barrels per day](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028), mainly concentrated in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\nRussian output remains “clouded,” with the IEA predicting declines as a result of sanctions on Moscow’s seaborne oil and petroleum products exports since the end of last year, along with the departure of Western companies that facilitated production. The IEA expects Russian supplies to ease by a [net 710,000 barrels per day](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) for the six-year forecast period to 2028.\\n\\n**Refining**\\n\\nIn the refining sector, [global capacity has been reduced by](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028) facility closures, conversions to biofuel plants and project delays since the pandemic. This reduction combined with a drop in Chinese oil product exports and an upheaval of Russian trade flows, resulted in record profits for the industry last year. IEA expects global refinery capacity to expand by [4.4 million barrels per day](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf) over the six-year period, with a 6 million barrels per day increase offset by planned closures.  IEA warns that while the amount of net refinery capacity additions by 2028 is expected to outpace demand growth for refined products, diverging trends among products could result in a repeat of the 2022 tightness in middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel.\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.53.52-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.53.52-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\n**Investment**\\n\\nIEA predicts that ongoing upstream oil investment will reach its highest level since 2015 at [$528 billion in 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) (11 percent increase), surpassing the amount that would be needed in a world that gets on track for net zero carbon emissions. Shell recently announced that it planned to keep its oil output steady until 2030, revising an earlier plan to cut production by between [1 percent and 2 percent a year](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html) over that period. BP announced earlier this year that it would scale back its targets to cut production, slashing oil output by [25 percent](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html) by 2030 from 2019 levels, where it previously planned to cut output by 40 percent. Both Shell and BP, however, still say that they plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\n\\n[IEA notes](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028) a number of factors that could affect market balances over the medium term – including uncertain global economic trends, the direction of OPEC+ decisions and China’s refining industry policy.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIEA sees the global oil market growing through 2028, where it is expected to peak due to the “clean energy transition” to electric vehicles, biofuels and improved vehicle efficiency. Oil supply growth is expected mainly in the United States, Brazil and Guyana with a spare capacity cushion in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For supply growth, investment must continue and IEA is forecasting an 11 percent increase year over year, reaching its highest level since 2015. The agency cautions that a number of issues could affect the market balances it is projecting.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Print Friendly, PDF & Email](https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-button.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028/# \\\"Printer Friendly, PDF & Email\\\")\\n\\n[See More Articles By This Expert](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/about/ier-site-manager/articles)\\n\\n### Tags\\n\\n[Domestic Energy Production,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/domestic-energy-production/)\\n\\n[energy production,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/energy-production/)\\n\\n[global energy issues,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/global-energy-issues/)\\n\\n[global energy markets,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/global-energy-markets/)\\n\\n[IEA,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/iea/)\\n\\n[oil production](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/oil-production/)\\n\\n##### June 2023\\n\\nBiden’s Energy Grid Not Prepared for the Onslaught of Electric Vehicles\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/uncategorized/bidens-energy-grid-not-prepared-for-the-onslaught-of-electric-vehicles/)\\n\\n##### June 2023\\n\\nChina Will Burn More Coal As It Supplies “Green Energy” Technologies to the World\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/climate-change/china-will-burn-more-coal-as-it-supplies-green-energy-technologies-to-the-world/)\\n\\nStay in Touch\\n\\n*   Enter your email address\\\\*\\n    \\n*   CAPTCHA\\n    \\n\\n          \\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/themes/ier2017/assets/images/logo_footer.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/)\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/instituteforenergyresearch)[](https://twitter.com/IERenergy)[](https://www.youtube.com/user/IERDC)\\n\\n*   [Contact](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/contact/)\\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/privacy-policy/)\\n*   [RSS Feeds](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/feed)\\n\\n![Image 9](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/themes/ier2017/assets/images/search_footer.png)\\n\\n[](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n![Image 10](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/logo.png)\\n\\n \\n\\nDon’t miss out on the latest news updates from IER’s team of energy experts.\\n\\n \\n\\nGet Updates From IER\\n\\nX\\n\\n         Notifications\\n\\n![Image 11: notification icon](https://img.onesignal.com/permanent/eec453fb-878c-435a-8919-7d21e7c3a15c/WufLNW6OSgiXWtCBQxWA_IER_Logo_Mark_Color_RGB%20copy.png)\\n\\nWe'd like to show you notifications for the latest news and updates.\\n\\nAllowCancel\\n\"\n",

Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/reuters-power-up/?location=article-paragraph)\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\n\\\"Future energy demand is found in the developing world due to increasing populations, middle class and urbanization,\\\" said OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais during the report's launch in Brazil, a country with which the group is seeking to form [closer ties](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-looking-forward-working-with-brazil-secretary-general-says-2024-09-23/).\\n\\nAl Ghais' speech in Rio de Janeiro was briefly disturbed by a protester from Greenpeace.\\n\\nA longer period of rising consumption would be a boost for OPEC, whose 12 members depend on oil income. In support of its view, OPEC said it expected more push back on \\\"ambitious\\\" clean energy targets, and cited plans by several global carmakers to [scale down](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/carmakers-adjust-electrification-plans-ev-demand-slows-2024-09-06/) electrification goals.\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\n\\\"There is no peak oil demand on the horizon,\\\" Al Ghais wrote in the foreword to the report.\\n\\n\\\"Over the past year, there has been further recognition that the world can only phase in new energy sources at scale when they are genuinely ready.\\\"\\n\\nOPEC expects world oil demand to reach 118.9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2045, around 2.9 million bpd higher than expected in last year's report. The report rolled out its timeline to 2050 and expects demand to hit 120.1 million bpd by then.\\n\\nThat is far above other 2050 forecasts from the industry. BP projects oil use will peak in 2025 and decline to 75 million bpd in 2050. [Exxon Mobil](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-forecasts-2050-oil-demand-match-todays-25-above-bp-estimate-2024-08-26/) [(XOM.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/XOM.N) expects oil demand to stay above 100 million bpd through 2050, similar to today's level.\\n\\nOPEC has been calling for more oil industry investment and said the sector needs $17.4 trillion to be spent to 2050, compared with $14 trillion needed by 2045 estimated last year.\\n\\n\\\"All policymakers and stakeholders need to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate,\\\" Al Ghais wrote.\\n\\nHIGHER 2029 FORECAST THAN IEA\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nOPEC also raised its medium term demand forecasts, citing a stronger economic backdrop than last year as inflation pressure wanes and central banks start to lower interest rates.\\n\\nWorld demand in 2028 will reach 111 million bpd, OPEC said, and 112.3 million bpd in 2029. The 2028 figure is up 800,000 bpd from last year's prediction.\\n\\nOPEC's 2029 forecast is more than 6 million bpd higher than that of the IEA, which said in June demand will plateau in 2029 at 105.6 million bpd. The gap is larger than the combined output of OPEC members Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nIn 2020, OPEC made a shift when the pandemic hit oil demand, saying consumption would plateau in the late 2030s. It has begun raising forecasts again as oil use has recovered.\\n\\nBy 2050, there will be 2.9 billion vehicles on the road, up 1.2 billion from 2023, OPEC forecast. Despite electric vehicle growth, vehicles powered by a combustion engine will account for more than 70% of the global fleet in 2050, the report said.\\n\\n\\\"Electric vehicles are poised for a larger market share, but obstacles remain, such as electricity grids, battery manufacturing capacity and access to critical minerals,\\\" it said.\\n\\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, are cutting supply to support the market. The report sees OPEC+'s share of the oil market rising to 52% in 2050 from 49% in 2023 as U.S. output peaks in 2030 and non-OPEC+ output does so in the early 2030s.\\n\\nReporting by Alex Lawler in

Following the commitment of its member governments to the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accords, the agency radically changed its mission to become a promoter of an energy transition. In 2022, the IEA’s governing board reinforced its mission to “guide countries as they build net-zero emission energy systems to comply with internationally agreed climate goals.”\\n\\nThe IEA’s current preoccupation with promoting an energy transition has resulted in its signature annual report, the World Energy Outlook (WEO), offering policymakers a view of future possibilities that are, at best, distorted and, at worst, dangerously wrong.\\n\\nThe 2024 WEO’s central conclusion, its core “outlook,” has been widely reported as a credible *forecast*, i.e., something *likely* to happen: “[T]he continued progress of transitions means that, by the end of the decade, the global economy can continue to grow without using additional amounts of oil, natural gas or coal.”\\n\\nThe WEO itself states that it doesn’t forecast but has *scenarios*—explorations or models of *possibilities*, and cautions: “Our scenario analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options…. [N]one of the scenarios should be viewed as a forecast.” Scenarios that usefully “inform” need to be based on realistic possibilities and assumptions. But there is one foundational assumption—one that the IEA has for decades included in its scenarios and that has been banished from the WEO: the possibility of business as usual (BAU).\\n\\nInstead, the WEO’s baseline scenario now assumes that nations are undertaking their\\n\\nspecific energy-transition plans that they promised in order to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement, i.e., “stated policies scenario” (STEPS). Yet none of the signatories to that Agreement is fully meeting its promises, and most are a long way behind schedule. Believing something that is not true is not just problematic; it meets the definition of a delusion.\\n\\nIt is fanciful to forecast that, over the next half-dozen years, the growth in the world’s population and economy won’t continue a two-century-long trend and lead to increased use of the fossil fuels that today supply over 80% of all energy, only slightly below the share seen 50 years ago. The data show that the global energy system is operating essentially along BAU lines and not only far off the STEPS, but even further away from the more aggressive transition aspirations that the WEO also models.\\n\\nIn this analysis, we focus on highlighting 23 problematic, flawed assumptions that are relevant specifically to the WEO’s oil scenarios and the widely reported “forecast” that the world will see peak oil demand by the early 2030s (see **box** on pp. 4-5, **Flawed Assumptions Lead to Flawed Conclusions**). While other scenarios about other energy sources are critical as well, oil remains a geopolitical touchstone and the single biggest source of global energy—10-fold greater than wind and solar combined. At the very least, this analysis points to the need for real-world scenarios in general and, in the case of oil, the much higher probability that demand continues to grow in the foreseeable future and, possibly, quite significantly (below, see **Global Oil Demand: Future Scenarios**).\\n\\nDebating the intricacies in flawed assumptions about energy scenarios is no mere theoretical exercise. The IEA’s legacy reputation continues to influence not only trillions of dollars in investment decisions but also government policies with far-reaching geopolitical consequences.\\n\\n#### Global Oil Demand: Future Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10b-Exec-Sum_Oil-Forecasts-WEO-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nThe promotional aspirations and flawed assumptions underlying IEA’s peak-demand scenarios have serious implications, given the obvious global economic and security considerations in planning for and delivering reliable, affordable energy supplies. The IEA is damaging its long legacy as the world’s leading energy security watchdog by offering dangerously misleading outlooks.\\n\\n## **Flawed Assumptions Lead to Flawed Conclusions**\\n\\nListed below is a summary of the flaws in 23 (but far from all) of the assumptions used in the WEO scenarios that are relevant to guessing future oil demand. Meaningful scenarios for planning for future uncertainties should include a range of realistic inputs, not just those that are aspirational.\\n\\n**Assumptions about baseline factors that affect oil forecasts**\\n\\n**Assumptions regarding oil’s future**\\n\\n**Assumptions about other transportation markets**\\n\\n**Assumptions regarding associated industries**\\n\\n## Introduction: The IEA and the Information Imperative\\n\\nFifty years ago, Germany’s Ulf Lantzke, an official at the OECD, was appointed as the first executive director of the new International Energy Agency (IEA). The organization’s creation followed the 1974 “energy shock” and consequent global recession. The recession was triggered by a roughly 400% jump in oil prices, the fallout from the oil embargo imposed in late 1973 by some members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.1 The motivation for establishing the IEA was thus not only to forge an international mechanism for coordination in the event of global energy disruptions but also to create a trusted source of global energy information.\\n\\nWhile much has changed in the world since 1974 in technological and political domains, what has not changed is the long-run trend of economic growth that uses more energy overall, including more fossil fuels. Not only do hydrocarbons continue to supply more than 80% of all global energy, but oil, the progenitor of the first modern energy crisis, remains the touchstone fuel in geopolitics and the single largest source of civilization’s energy supply. Energy markets and geopolitics are no less critical today than when the IEA was established, as is the need for reliable information.\\n\\nHowever, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, the IEA recast its mission to adopt advocacy of an “energy transition” alongside the original mission to support “energy security.”2 In 2022, the IEA’s governing board voted to expand the agency’s mission as one “to guide countries as they build net-zero emission energy systems to *comply* with internationally agreed climate goals” (emphasis added).3 As one report from the European Parliament put it, the “IEA has become an advocate of ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to combat climate change.”4\\n\\nWithout regard to the reasons for, or merits of, the shift in the IEA’s mission, the extent to which countries engage policies to displace hydrocarbons can itself have the potential to increase, rather than ameliorate, the risks of disruptions. Moreover, the extent to which such transition efforts become aspirational or motivational, rather than anchored in agnostic analyses, also creates challenges, in particular for information transparency and clarity for policy planning.\\n\\nThe publication each year of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) is a major event for energy policymakers and analysts everywhere. It is enormously influential because the IEA has 31 governments behind it whose energy priorities its work reflects and because there are few other studies with the breadth and depth seen in the IEA’s work, which is freely available to everyone.\\n\\n## Where We Agree with the IEA\\n\\nThe data, including data in the WEO, show that, thus far, there is no evidence of a rapid or even significant energy transition. In 1973 oil, coal, and natural gas contributed 85% of primary energy consumption, and in 2023 the share was 82%.5 Because hydrocarbons are used, whether directly or indirectly, in all products and services, it is vital to ensure that there is an adequate, reliable, and affordable supply for all countries. For developing nations, this is particularly important since, for them, the critical transition is not from hydrocarbons to renewables but away from having too little or unreliable energy in general.\\n\\nThe 2024 WEO highlights the key challenge of meeting the surprising—at least in contrast to the previous year’s WEO—increase in the expected need for electricity supplies for both emerging and mature economies: “[O]ne of the striking findings of this Outlook is how fast demand for electricity is set to rise, with the equivalent of the electricity use of the world’s ten largest cities being added to global demand each year” (p. 2).\\n\\nWhen it comes to providing the energy and materials needed for the electric sector, and all others, as Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director, notes in the WEO foreword: “The world is facing perilous times. Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s continued war in Ukraine have global attention sharply focused on some of the world’s most important energy-producing regions.” He notes that “energy security is again a major theme of this year’s World Energy Outlook” (p. 3). In that regard, few would disagree with Dr. Birol’s observation: “Robust, independent analysis and data-driven insights are vital to navigate today’s energy uncertainties” (p. 15).\\n\\nThus, we agree with the agency’s self-assessment: “The IEA’s flagship World Energy Outlook, published every year, is the most authoritative global source of energy analysis and projections. It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development” (p. 398).\\n\\nPlanning for the future is inherently a game of assumptions that can be plugged into models to consider potential outcomes around which governments and industries can make investment decisions. For planners everywhere, it is, of course, critical to gauge the extent to which models of future possibilities may be truly realistic, or merely aspirational, or even silly. Determining that depends almost entirely on assessing the underlying assumptions, the inputs to the models.\\n\\nThe assumptions integral to the IEA’s scenarios are based on explicit and implicit forecasts about both policies and, critically, about technologies.\\n\\nThe IEA clearly states that the WEO “examines three main long-term scenarios—*none of which are forecasts*—to provide a framework for understanding possible energy futures” (p. 67; emphasis added). However, the media and the analyst community treat the WEO as providing forecasts. There are myriad examples of invoking the “forecasts” from the IEA in news headlines and reports by financial analysts.6 The advocates of an “energy transition” also, unsurprisingly, invoke the WEO as providing forecasts: “The IEA’s forecast of an upcoming peak in demand for oil, gas, and coal remains unchanged.”7\\n\\nThis widespread conviction that the WEO makes *forecasts*, again, is not explicitly endorsed by the IEA, since the WEO repeats its caution in more than one place: “Our scenario analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options, not to predict how they will act, and *none of the scenarios should be viewed as a forecast*” (pp. 20, 69; emphasis added).\\n\\nThis has important consequences because the IEA’s scenarios are often viewed as the gold standard and are used to guide the policies of myriad governments and companies everywhere. Given the centrality of energy to all countries, the WEO can influence decisions about trillions of dollars of projects, subsidies, grants, and\\n\\ninducements, nearly all with the stated goal of achieving an energy transition away from hydrocarbons. As it observes, “all parties need to recognize that locking in fossil fuel use has consequences” (p. 20). Inversely, it is also true that locking out access to fossil fuels will have consequences.\\n\\nWhen it comes to policy or investment planning, there is a distinction with a critical difference when it comes to what constitutes a “forecast” (what is *likely* to happen) versus a “scenario” (a *possibility* based on assumptions). The challenge is not in determining whether the scenarios are completely factual per se, but instead whether they are factually complete.\\n\\nOne cannot have an unmanageable range of assumptions, given that scenarios and models are frequently treated as “forecasts,” or, at least, reasonable predictors; the use of unreasonable—even if theoretically possible— assumptions can lead to outcomes that are, by definition, improbable, if not nearly impossible. Thus, a core security and economic challenge for policymakers is to have scenarios that inform about real-world possibilities.\\n\\n## Where We Disagree with the IEA\\n\\nThe IEA’s scenarios are based on assumptions about:\\n\\nThe IEA asserts8 that the WEO “covers the whole energy system” to highlight “consequences and contingencies that lie ahead.” To realize that claim would require evaluating scenarios based on how, as the IEA states, “the energy system might be affected by changing key variables.” However, a careful reading of the voluminous WEO makes clear that the IEA does not come close to exploring the consequences arising from changes to key variables. Before turning to some of the claims and assumptions specific to oil (e.g., EV market penetration), we first highlight some key assumptions that are either flawed or disputable (thus calling for wider/different scenarios) that anchor those domains directly affecting oil-market forecasts.\\n\\n### 1. Assumptions About Baseline Factors That Affect Oil Forecasts\\n\\nIn order to fully reflect, as the WEO puts it, “today’s uncertainties” (p. 15), scenarios should begin with the possibility that some, or many, governments could modify or even abandon the “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS) that has been framed for compliance with the Paris Agreement. Of the three scenarios modeled by the IEA, STEPS is used as the baseline WEO scenario, and the other two scenarios are modeled on even more aggressive pledges and aspirations for replacing hydrocarbons: the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS); and the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario.\\n\\n#### **Flawed Assumption: STEPS is a useful baseline**\\n\\nIn earlier years, the WEO included a business as usual (BAU) scenario providing insights into future energy demands based on what countries and companies are actually doing rather than what they say they might do, or “pledge” to do. The merit of a BAU scenario should be obvious not only because it is a baseline anchored in the world as it is, but also because it can illuminate requirements and consequences for future energy demands if the world continues to operate as is, rather than “as wished for.”\\n\\nUsing STEPS as a de facto baseline is not just problematic but a borderline delusion—“belief in something that is not true.” No nation is doing what it has pledged to do. Only 10 small nations (collectively, about 1% share of global energy) are “almost sufficient” in meeting their Paris Agreement pledges. None of the other 30 nations is close9 (see **Figure 1**).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Corporate transition policies are real and durable*\\n\\nIt is clear from both news about and surveys of corporations that many businesses are slowly retreating from (or some entirely abandoning) many of the existing as well as pledged energy plans that are inherent in STEPS.\\n\\nIn recent months, we have seen several examples of major energy companies diluting their commitments to energy-transition targets. Until mid-2024, for example, BP was committed to reducing oil and gas output by 25% by 2030. Under its new leadership, the company has instead revised upward its plans to produce oil in the Gulf of Mexico while at the same time announcing the sale of its U.S. onshore wind energy business. Shell, too, has watered down transition-centric commitments. Previously, the company committed to reducing the net carbon intensity of its energy products by 20% from 2016 levels by 2030, 45% by 2035, and to “net zero” by 2050. Shell is now aiming for a 15%–20% reduction by 2030 and has dropped the 2035 target. Neither Shell nor BP is mentioned in the WEO.\\n\\nIn its long-term outlook to 2050, published in August 2024, ExxonMobil forecasts that oil demand, rather than shrinking, would remain close to 100 million barrels per day (mmbd) and that high levels of investment in exploration and development would be required to meet such demand.10\\n\\nWe cannot know what further changes other corporations may yet make. But these examples—and there are many others—show that energy-transition targets made several years ago are now being reassessed, reduced, or rejected in the face of the reality of a world that is using a lot more conventional energy to meet the needs of expanding economies and populations.\\n\\nWhile the IEA does not explicitly discount the potential for an extended era of higher economic growth in the next several decades, that is the implicit effect of WEO’s use of an average GDP growth rate that is at the low end of historical averages. It is problematic to base plans on the fact that all three WEO scenarios use the same assumption of a 2.7% annual growth for the global economy. The WEO offers the reasons: “We maintain a constant economic growth rate across scenarios to facilitate a comparison of the impacts of different energy and climate choices with a consistent backdrop” (p. 67). While there is some logic to that, it is prima facie an incomplete assumption for useful scenarios.\\n\\n### Figure 1: Ranking the Status of Paris-Centric Energy-Transition Plans\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-3.44.31%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\nMeanwhile, the WEO, along with others, sees the massive investment under way in AI and digital infrastructures such as data centers as a stimulant for growth. The WEO does focus on electricity demand from digital infrastructures, but that misses the broader point: those market-driven investments come from the economic value of the associated products and services, which suggests the potential for more growth than modeled.\\n\\nNo economist or policymaker should believe that he can predict the actual future economic growth rate. But for planning purposes, it is crucial to understand the consequences of a higher growth rate, not least because the pursuit of prosperity remains a central goal of (most) governments and because annual GDP global growth rates have frequently been a half-percentage point higher than the WEO models (see **Figure 2**). The WEO’s 2.7% annual growth rate is lower than the 3.2% average rate from 2010 to 2023. A scenario assuming, say, the same 3.2% annual growth rate—and a BAU relationship between GDP and oil—would lead to global oil demand in 2035 some 10 mmbd of oil greater than today. That difference is equal to adding another entire Europe Union to global oil demand.\\n\\n### Figure 2: Global GDP Growth Rate\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2-Global-GDP-Growth-Rate-IEA-1-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: Macrotrends, “[World GDP Growth Rate 1961-2024](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/WLD/world/gdp-growth-rate)“\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Transition financing will continue to expand*\\n\\nFinancing society-scale alternative energy technologies is proving to be a major obstacle to the achievement of energy-transition goals. While it is in developing countries where we find the need for most alternative energy finance, it is the developed world where most of the money goes. The WEO notes that “the share of clean energy investment in emerging market and developing economies outside of China remains stuck at 15% of the total, even though these economies account for two-thirds of the global population and one-third of global GDP” (p. 21). Whether, and how, this share can increase is a key issue for transition aspirations; real-world models would include scenarios where that issue remains unresolved.\\n\\nBefore looking at the immediate trends in energy financing, it is worth pointing out that the assumptions underpinning the financing of the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario are fantastical. The WEO states that in the\\n\\nNZE scenario, “annual spending on clean energy doubles in advanced economies and in China by 2035 compared with 2023 levels, while it grows more than six-fold in other developing economies” (p. 61; see **Figure 3**). There is no sign that this level of increase is happening or credible.\\n\\nMore modest climate finance targets—such as the commitment made at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 by rich countries to provide $100 billion each year in climate finance to developing countries—have not been met. The OECD tracks four primary sources of climate finance under the umbrella of that $100 billion initiative, and for the period 2013–21, the cumulative shortfall was $265 billion. Only in 2022 (the latest data available) was the target exceeded (see **Figure 4**). However, according to Oxfam, the British aid charity, even this apparent modest success is not what it seems.11 Oxfam reports that of the $116 billion pledged in 2022 (the last year for which OECD data are available), $92 billion was public finance, of which 70% was in the form of loans at market interest rates, not grants.\\n\\n### Figure 3: The WEO’s Fantastical Assumptions About Investment\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-3.58.32%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 4: Pledged vs. Actual Energy-Transition Financial Aid Sent to Emerging Markets\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-4-Pledged-vs-Actual-Energy-Transition-Financial-Aid-Sent-to-Emerging-Markets-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: OECD, “[Climate Finance and the USD 100 Billion Goal](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html),” 2022\\n\\nThe $100 billion tracked by the OECD is only a small part of the $2 trillion estimated by the IEA to have been committed globally in 2024 for “clean energy” investment. The WEO reports that $4.5 trillion a year is needed by 2030 and beyond to implement the NZE scenario (p. 155). In view of all the domestic pressures on governments in wealthy countries, the continuing impact everywhere of relatively high interest rates, and the continuing—if somewhat moderated—inflation in the costs of workforce and materials, it seems fantastical to believe that such an increase is feasible.\\n\\nThe investment challenge is summed up well in the WEO, even if the scenarios ignore the variables. The IEA sees three categories, or groups—which, again, should be modeled, but are not fully modeled. In the first group, investing in mature alternative energy technologies in well-regulated markets such as Brazil and India can be handled by the private sector. In the second group, the WEO calls for “facilitated interventions” (p. 65) to increase the deployment of alternative energy in less developed countries. The IEA notes that this “cover[s] projects where the national creditworthiness is low and a constraint on investors, or where significant social returns, such as those arising from improved energy access, need some form of public support to ensure affordability and bankability” (p. 65). How much appetite there is in the private sector and, indeed, international institutions for “facilitated interventions” remains to be seen. Certainly, the debates and resistance to such expansion are evident and, again, suggest that scenarios need to incorporate fewer, not more, financial “interventions.” The third group, albeit representing only about 6% of projects in the NZE scenario, essentially covers very high-risk countries (a euphemism for corrupt and unstable) that might involve “nascent” (p. 65) technologies (a euphemism for either unproven or nonexistent on a commercial scale).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Efficiency gains and structural changes will lower global demand for energy*\\n\\nA significant feature in the WEO scenarios entails claims about the means not only for reducing energy growth but for the possibility of achieving an absolute *reduction* in overall energy use, even as populations and economies expand. Setting aside the questionable durability of imposed mandates (such as banning the sales of conventional vehicles or natural gas residential heating), or proposed behavioral changes (such as fewer personal automobiles, fewer vacation flights, etc.), the WEO rests much on the effect of changes to the “structure of the global economy” and the effect of greater technical efficiency. The former is the continued migration of nations to service-centric economies and the latter to efficiency gains in end-use equipment (pp. 25, 26).\\n\\nThat maturing economies migrate toward greater dominance of services in their GDP, rather than industries, is a well-established long-run trend. But that trend has not resulted in lowering overall global energy demand; rather, it has shifted much demand from mature to emerging economies. It has also created the illusion of lower energy use in mature economies, thus creating misleading impressions of improvements in national energy efficiencies. Domestic energy efficiencies should be more properly calculated, especially for the U.S. and Europe—the exemplars of the service-efficiency trend—by including the energy embodied in imports of products or materials (e.g., steelmaking and aluminum) from countries such as China or India. The aviation industry, for example, is a service sector with operational energy uses that, self-evidently, include the use of energy-intensive hardware and materials, but much of the latter is produced offshore and is invisible in domestic data.\\n\\nRegarding long-run efficiency trends of devices and machines, the WEO reflects well-established views that there are “improvements in the technical efficiency of energy use, via more efficient processes or equipment” (p. 26). In a static economy, that would arithmetically result in lowered energy use. However, as is widely known, the overall long-run reality is that foundational efficiency gains drive net growth in overall demand— the so-called Jevon’s Paradox. There is no evidence that this multi-century trend has changed in recent decades (see **Figure 5**).\\n\\n### Figure 3: Global Trends: Energy Efficiency vs. Total Energy Consumption\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-5-Global-Trends-Energy-Efficiency-vs-Total-Energy-Consumption-1500x1184.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Solar and wind power are 100% efficient*\\n\\nIn the WEO discussion about energy efficiency, we find a particularly odd, and fundamentally incorrect, claim that has the earmarks of an overenthusiastic talking point, rather than an idea rooted in reality: “Unlike fossil fuels, most renewables are *considered 100% efficient*, i.e., conversion losses are not measured because the resources are directly harnessed from naturally occurring sources of energy, such as sunlight, wind and water, without the need for extraction or combustion processes” (p. 27; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe observation that the sun and wind “resources are directly harnessed” is misleading, an artifact of boundary choices. The harnessing requires building machines that entail energy-intensive materials that significantly affect resource-to-user efficiencies. Fabricating solar photovoltaic (PV) silicon, for example, is at least 10-fold more energy-intensive per pound than fabricating steel.\\n\\nRegardless of the rhetorical flourish about “directly” harnessing, the 100% claim itself is simply a violation of fundamental physics, both incorrect and impossible. There *are* conversion losses; one has to define boundaries. Claiming 100% efficiency for a PV cell’s output is logically the same as claiming 100% efficiency for a combustion engine’s output.\\n\\nA conventional (widely used) PV cell converts ~15% to 20% of the available energy in incident photons into electricity. The physical scale, economic, and materials costs of solar electricity are, self-evidently, dictated by that inefficiency and the very low energy density of the primary source (incident solar energy).\\n\\nA conventional (widely used) gas turbine converts ~40% to 60% of the available energy in natural gas into electricity. A conventional combustion engine converts ~20% to 30% of the available energy in fuel into mechanical energy.12 The scale, costs, and materials used are similarly dictated by that inefficiency but offset by the far higher density of hydrocarbons.\\n\\nHigher efficiencies have been demonstrated for both PV cells and engines using existing materials and technologies, as much as about 50% for PV cells and nearly 80% for combustion turbines. There is, from the physics (and economics) of wind and solar, nothing particularly unique in that regard, or inherently more efficient.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China’s actions will follow its pledges*\\n\\nBefore turning to the assumptions that are specifically focused on scenarios for future oil demand, we note one additional example of WEO assumptions that are debatable, if not profoundly unrealistic: those associated with China’s energy trajectory. The WEO sees China’s coal use starting to shrink in a few years (see **Figure 6**). This seems unlikely, given that China’s electricity generation from coal in 2023 was 37% higher than a decade earlier;13 and in the same period, China has added to its grid 390 GW of new coal-fired capacity, and there are plans for another 141 new power stations (not taking into account retirements).14 Considering that such power plants have an operating life of over 40 years, a reasonable scenario would also model increasing, not declining, coal use, regardless of China’s “stated policies.”\\n\\n### Figure 6: WEO China Energy Scenario\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-4.10.56%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 7: Transportation Costs as a Share of Final Product Prices\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-7-Transportation-Costs-as-a-Share-of-Final-Product-Prices-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: Jean-Paul Rodrigue, “[Share of Transport Costs in Product Prices and Average Domestic Haul Length](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter3/transportation-and-economic-development/transport-costs-prices-domestic-haul-united-states/),” in *The Geography of Transport Systems*, 6th ed. (New York: Routledge, 2024), chap. 3\\n\\n### 2. Assumptions Regarding Oil’s Future\\n\\nPetroleum supplies 40% of global energy, wind and solar combined about 4%, and all other renewables— mainly hydro dams and biomass—bring the renewable total to under 10%.\\n\\nOver 95% of the movement of all people, goods, and services is powered by machines that burn oil.15 Since 1974, the number of cars in the world has increased by 500%, total maritime tons shipped is up 350%, and air-travel passenger miles have risen nearly 2,000%.16 Economies collapse if the costs of transportation soar or, worse, cease (see **Figure 7**).\\n\\nIn the WEO, as well as in the IEA’s monthly *Oil Market Report* and its latest medium-term outlook Oil 2024— Analysis and Forecast to 2030, the agency assumes that global oil demand will peak before 2030, based on the WEO’s STEPS—that current policies and programs will be implemented as planned. However, as outlined above, this is less, rather than more, likely to be the case. This is partly because of the inevitable changes in governments, not least in the U.S., which has the world’s biggest oil market. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely, given the current political climate in many key countries, that future changes will lead to tougher policies to implement the Paris Agreement. Rather, the commitment is likely to weaken.\\n\\nIn the 2024 WEO (chap. 4), the IEA considers the possibility that oil demand could be higher or lower than shown in the STEPS. Although this might appear to be a nod to criticism leveled at the 2023 WEO, which also did not contain a BAU scenario, the variations in oil demand considered in the 2024 WEO are far from a realistic assessment of known ranges of possibilities.\\n\\nIn a recent edition of its *Oil Market Report*17 and its five-year outlook,18 the IEA shows global oil demand rising from 102.9 mmbd in 2024 to 105.4 mmbd in 2030, with the expectation that 2030 is a definitive peak. This is wishful thinking, given the realities of growing needs in developing countries. For global oil demand to peak by 2030, it must be assumed that developing countries won’t grow at the pace seen in recent decades—never mind, the hoped-for faster growth.\\n\\nPetroleum liquids consumption by OECD countries did peak back in 2005 and today it is 11% lower due to efficiency gains, saturation in some passenger vehicle markets, and a significant drop in oil used for electric power generation (mainly in Europe).19\\n\\nIn 2005, when OECD oil demand peaked, the rest of the world’s far greater population used just 67% as much oil as the rich countries. That ratio has flipped: it is now the OECD that uses only 81% as much oil as do all the developing countries.20\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The oil growth in emerging markets will be low*\\n\\nWhile the growth of oil demand in developing countries has been significant, there remains an enormous disparity when it is compared with the per-capita oil use of the wealthier OECD nations. Even in China, which has seen three decades of strong economic growth, oil use per capita remains only 36% of the OECD average. More significantly, India uses only 12% of the OECD’s per-capita average, and Africa is at only 9% of the OECD average.\\n\\nPopulations in developing countries are growing rapidly: Nigeria’s population, for example, is expected to grow from 230 million in 2024 to 380 million by 2050. For India, the corresponding numbers are 1.44 billion to 1.67 billion; the numbers in the African continent are 1.49 billion to 2.49 billion. The net increase in overall global population by 2050 versus 2024 is estimated to be 1.6 billion people.21 Many of them could be, by 2050, even wealthier than the doubling of global GDP that the WEO assumes (p. 301).\\n\\nIt is inconceivable that these rising populations with growing economies will not experience enormous increases in oil use. This will come from increasing numbers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles of all kinds, and, as disposable incomes rise, far more citizens will not only travel but also buy more goods. The latter, in turn, means more plastics, which requires more petrochemicals, i.e., more oil and gas.\\n\\nWith little credibility, the WEO asserts that its sensitivity analysis shows that “even *combining all the high cases, global peaks for oil*, natural gas and coal demand *would still occur within a few years* of those for STEPS, albeit at higher absolute levels” (p. 165; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe realistic potential for very strong upward oil-demand pressure from developing countries is entirely absent from WEO scenarios.\\n\\nConsider a useful exercise to illustrate the theoretically possible growth in oil demand outside OECD countries. One could simply extrapolate China’s current per-capita oil use to the rest of the non-OECD world. China is a useful benchmark because its oil use has increased year-on-year since 1993 (demand did not fall, even during the pandemic lockdowns of 2020) and is now seven times higher than 30 years ago.\\n\\nNon-OECD (excluding China) oil demand at Chinese per-capita levels would be 23 mmbd higher than today, representing 10-fold more growth than in the WEO STEPS. That increase would more than offset declining gasoline use in wealthy nations, leading to global demand reaching 126 mmbd—some 20% higher than the peak imagined by the WEO (see **Figure 8**).\\n\\nIf emerging markets were ever to match the OECD average per-capita usage, global oil demand would exceed a staggering 230 mmbd, versus 103 mmbd in 2024. For many reasons, we are not suggesting that developing countries will soon, or even ever, reach the OECD per-capita oil level. But 230 mmbd gives one a sense of the direction of potential ultimate demand.\\n\\nEven though the WEO failed to do so, it would be reasonable to assume a baseline scenario where emerging-market oil demand grows at the same annual rate of 2.3% seen since 1990.22 This would yield in 2030 a demand that is 6.7 mmbd higher than in 2023; and in 2035, it will be 12.1 mmbd higher, both of which are about 3 mmbd and 9 mmbd higher than the WEO STEPS.\\n\\nThe gap between a reasonable BAU scenario and the WEO widens if one, also reasonably, assumes that there is a good chance that wealthy economies will see less of a decline in oil use than assumed in all the WEO scenarios. Assumptions about the market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) are, of course, the central feature in the WEO oil calculations.\\n\\n### Figure 8: Oil-Demand Potential\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.23.56-PM.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The EV market share will accelerate*\\n\\nThe far greater use of EVs constitutes a centerpiece of the WEO. For that reason alone, a full range of variables should be, but are not, incorporated into its scenarios of future demand. The WEO assumes that the “market share of new electric passenger cars sold in the STEPS reaches about 45% by 2030” (p. 174) and “to over 55% by 2035” (p. 160).\\n\\nThe recent, rapid growth rate of EV sales in wealthy nations is slowing, not accelerating. Regardless of whether the slowdown is temporary, or the new normal, that reality should be in planning scenarios. IEA data show that 11% of vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2023 were electric. For the world, EV sales that year were 18%—but that figure is highly distorted by China’s massive domestic subsidies, resulting in that nation accounting for 60% of global EVs sold. Meanwhile, the 2023 share of EVs sold in India was 2%, Brazil 3%, Indonesia 2%, Malaysia 2%, Thailand 10%, and Vietnam 15%.23 In developing countries with rapidly growing populations, the rate of ownership of any type of vehicle is still very low: India has only 59 cars per thousand people of driving age, compared with 226 in China. In Nigeria, the figure is 61. For context, in the U.S. there are 908 cars per thousand people of driving age.24 Whether rising vehicle ownership is dominated, or not, by EVs will depend on many factors, but in the main, by price.\\n\\nIn its annual EV report, the IEA estimated that in 2023, EVs displaced about 0.8 mmbd of global oil demand (gasoline and diesel).25 In the conclusion of its 2024 oil report (one of the inputs to the WEO), the IEA asserts that efficiency improvements and electrification mean that global gasoline use peaked in 2024, at 27.2 mmbd; and by 2030, it will have fallen to 25.4 mmbd. But this is based on “policy settings,” not by real-world trends.26\\n\\nThe behavior of automakers offers an obvious example of a divergence between policy settings and reality, trends that have been clear for many months prior to the publication of the 2024 WEO. The WEO asserts that “the number of electric car sales in the STEPS is aligned with the plans of the automotive industry. Although some automakers have recently scaled back short-term EV production plans, their longer-term EV plans still point to the production of well over 40 million electric cars per year by 2030” (p. 36). The WEO does go on to note that there “have also been some rollbacks and postponements of previous [EV] policies, although the impact of these remains relatively small” (p. 81). A reasonable sensitivity analysis would at least consider the trends continuing, and even expanding.\\n\\nDuring 2024, there were myriad announcements from car manufacturers that the production of EVs would be lower than forecast in response to weaker consumer demand. A recent example was the Ford Motor Company’s third-quarter 2024 results.27 The company lost $1.2 billion in its EV business. Based on the sales volume of 20,962 EVs, Ford lost nearly $60,000 on each such vehicle sold. But Ford’s forecast is not the only one. Volkswagen, General Motors, and Mercedes are also paring back their market forecasts.28 Fundamental issues impair consumer adoption, not least EVs’ affordability. There was also the performance of EVs in cold weather, inadequate charging infrastructure in general, and, especially, the cost and availability of high-speed charging to come closer to the refueling time for regular gasoline vehicles. Meanwhile, the EV market consists largely of wealthy buyers.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Governments will stay the course on EV mandates*\\n\\nIn the WEO, the IEA points out that of the 17 million units estimated to have been sold in 2024, 10 million will be in China (p. 34). In a command economy, there is little transparency concerning costs and revenues, and there is no doubt that massive government subsidies have played a major part in China’s EV expansion. In Western countries, subsidies are being scaled back. At the end of 2022, the German government abruptly cut back its subsidies. Sweden did the same thing early in 2023, as did New Zealand at the end of the year. While government support for EVs continues in those countries and others, budgetary pressures are now a factor in scaling back support.\\n\\nThe new Trump administration is unlikely to tighten regulations governing the fuel-efficiency standards for ICE vehicles. Indeed, some rollback is expected. Also, the subsidies for EVs and batteries built in to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could be scaled back. In the EU, the political drive behind environmental measures is, at a minimum, fracturing following elections in several member countries.\\n\\nWhen the 2024 WEO was developed, the IEA could not have anticipated the U.S. election outcome. But a reasonable sensitivity analysis would incorporate the slowdown and reversals of EV subsidies in other nations, and consider the fact that any anticipated increase in U.S. subsidies was already at risk (p. 37). Ahead of the 2024 U.S. election, the costs of the IRA subsidies were already subject to increasing scrutiny, not least by a report from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) noting that the IRA spends $32,000 for each additional EV sold and that 75% of the EV subsidies claimed thus far under that law have gone to consumers who would have bought an EV anyway.29\\n\\nNonetheless, the WEO sticks to its fundamentally optimistic—and, from a scenario modeling perspective, narrow—assumptions about EVs, such as: “Although some incentive schemes have been revised, governments remain active in supporting EV uptake in a variety of ways” (p. 37). Another such assumption: “Around 30 countries have set zero emissions vehicle goals or timelines to phase out ICE vehicles. In the STEPS, electric car sales reach more than 40 million globally by 2030, which means that nearly one-in-two cars sold that year will be either a battery electric or a plug-in hybrid vehicle” (p. 110).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China’s EV “success story” leads quickly to lower oil demand*\\n\\nChina, which is regularly cited by the IEA and others as a major success story for EVs and significant oil displacement, may not be as it seems. A recent paper by Kpler, a global data and analysis company, suggests that although sales of EVs in China reached a 51% market share in September 2024, at the end of the year the total on-road vehicle fleet was still over 80% gasoline-fueled, with EVs at 13%.30 Kpler points out that gasoline cars will still constitute 70% of China’s fleet in 2030 and that the share will not fall below 50% until 2040. The impact on gasoline demand will not, according to the company, be as dramatic as many believe. Today, with large numbers of gasoline cars still being purchased, only 1% of new EVs are replacing gasoline cars. At expected rates of EV growth, it won’t be until the early 2030s that EVs lead to net displacement of existing gasoline cars. Before then, gasoline demand in China will remain relatively stable. Yet the IEA believes that gasoline demand in China “may even tip into decline from 2025 amid rampant, mass-market electrification.”31\\n\\nAnother issue highlighted in Kpler’s paper is the discrepancy between theoretical claims of gasoline consumption from carmakers and the actual performance in the real world. In China, real gasoline consumption is about 15% higher than claimed by the manufacturers, and today the fleet is not reaching the aspirational fuel-consumption goals. The Kpler analysis finds 248,000 barrels a day of gasoline being displaced in China by EVs, versus the IEA’s estimate of about 600,000 b/d.32\\n\\n### 3. Assumptions About Other Transportation Markets\\n\\nAlthough EVs constitute the epicenter of variables relevant to future oil displacement, the WEO devotes considerable effort, and apparent enthusiasm, to the potential for electrifying virtually all other forms of transportation and adjacent uses for petroleum. One may be tempted to speculate about PR motives, i.e., providing the impression of “accelerating” electrification of everything (see **Figure 9**). The fact is that these other sectors are either realistically impossible to significantly electrify (e.g., heavy-duty trucks, aircraft), or, where it is easy (e.g., bicycles), the oil displacement is irrelevant. The WEO notes that electrifying global two- and three-wheelers would displace 750,000 barrels per day, or under 1% of demand.\\n\\n### Figure 9: Forecast Global Market Shares\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.18.34-PM.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification of heavy-duty trucks*\\n\\nTrucking, which accounts for ~17% of global oil use, compared with ~25% for automobiles, will remain a hard sector to electrify, especially in long-distance applications. The reasons are similar to those affecting the growth of EVs in the passenger market: the range and time needed for recharging. Electrification is likely to proceed in short-haul delivery fleets, buses, etc., a trend visible in China’s command economy, where heavy-duty trucks saw a 10% share of sales in 2023 (p. 109); but globally in 2030, only 3% of larger trucks will be electric (p. 110).\\n\\nCost remains a major barrier for electrifying long-distance trucks, with new vehicle prices two to three times higher than conventional diesel-fueled vehicles.33 Even if costs fall, the collateral challenges for improvements to charging infrastructure remain daunting. Electrification is not yet a significant factor for trucking and buses. In 2023, only 3% of all bus sales were electrified. The IEA does not provide data for 2023; but we know that in 2022, only 1.2% of worldwide truck sales were electric.34\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification and fuel alternatives in aviation*\\n\\nGlobal aviation accounts for about 10% of all oil use. The WEO acknowledges the exceptional difficulty of electrifying aviation or decarbonizing the fuel, but it devotes significant effort to imagining opportunities and, more critically, ignores factors that could drive far higher oil demand. It points to various initiatives to increase blending into the aviation-fuel pool of “sustainable fuels”; but in 2030 and 2050, they will contribute only 2% and 10%, respectively (p. 111). All this is in the context of WEO’s anemic projections for potential increases in aviation-fuel demand.\\n\\nThe IEA base case (STEPS) sees jet-fuel consumption in 2030 just 13% higher than in 2024, and the pre-Covid peak demand not reached again until 2027. Meanwhile, independent data from the Airports Council International (ACI) show that 2024 passenger volumes are already at 106% of the 2019 level.35 In the longer term, ACI forecasts that passenger volumes by 2042 will be double the 2024 level. While aircraft-fuel efficiency will inevitably improve, the rise in passenger numbers suggests that fuel consumption could grow far more than in the STEPS (p.316). And the APS implausibly sees jet kerosene consumption peaking by 2030 and down 4% by 2050.\\n\\nAll this is in the context of an industry that is expected to boom in the decades to come. Asia is a major source of expansion, with a 57% growth in intra-regional travel demand projected by 2030 versus the pre-pandemic year of 2019.36 Moreover, air-cargo shipments are also expected to grow. While air freight is only 1% of global trade by volume, it represents 35% by value.37\\n\\nThe WEO also failed to acknowledge the travails of aircraft manufacturers, specifically those in the global duopoly of Boeing and Airbus Industries, in delivering newer and more efficient aircraft. Delays in updating the fleet mean that older, more fuel-hungry, aircraft will remain in service longer. At the same time, many airlines are keeping older aircraft in service for longer, in order to meet demand and save capital. Older aircraft, however, typically burn 15% more fuel than newer models.38\\n\\nThese factors will collaterally drive the need for greater airport capacity, a facet of the market ignored or underestimated in WEO scenarios. Independent analysts see six of the 10 most significant global airport projects located in Asia and the Middle East and two in the U.S. (Los Angeles and New York). The word “airport” doesn’t appear anywhere in the WEO.39\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification and fuel alternatives for ships*\\n\\nSome 80% of global trade is carried by ships. While the STEPS in WEO correctly sees international bunker-fuel demand growing out to 2050, the APS projects a 9% decline by 2035 (p. 304).\\n\\nThe targeted reduction in shipping fuel use was set by the International Maritime Organization seeking a 20% CO2 emissions reduction by 2030, 70% by 2040, and full-scale decarbonization around 2050 (benchmarked from 2008 levels). Real-world analysts see no prospect of meeting shipping goals in either STEPS or APS. As of June 2024, 93% of the gross tonnage of ships in operation used conventional fuels (various grades of fuel oil/ marine diesel).40 The other 7% consisted almost entirely of LNG-fueled ships with minuscule shares for LPG and nonconventional fuels (ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, and battery/hybrid vessels). For ships on order, oil-fueled accounts for 51%, with LNG’s share at 36%. And while the WEO frequently mentions hydrogen and ammonia (e.g., p. 111), those fuels account for 0.7% of orders.\\n\\nWe note that the WEO doesn’t mention the one viable opportunity for reducing maritime fuel use: the potential for ships to use electricity when docked at port. As much as 7% of ships’ energy consumption occurs there, and from 2030 and 2035, respectively, two sets of EU regulations state that certain categories of vessels must connect to shoreside electricity while docked. The EU regulations are complex and look unlikely to be fully implemented; nonetheless, they are in place.41\\n\\nMeanwhile, the IEA nowhere mentions the potential for a massive rise in demand for shipping—and collaterally for fuel used. This is directly related to the huge increase in the need for minerals required for constructing the alternative energy hardware imagined in all WEO scenarios. The WEO does provide estimates for the staggering increases in mineral demands but ignores the shipping. *The Maritime Executive* magazine estimates that 2,300–3,500 new ships will be needed annually through 2040. Shipbuilders are currently adding 400–500 new bulk carriers a year.42\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be a rapid decline in oil used for Middle East power generation*\\n\\nThe WEO points to the significant 1.7 mmbd of oil burned in the Middle East’s power-generation sector, representing 25% of that region’s electricity supply (p. 177). While the WEO acknowledges that there is much uncertainty about whether this oil will be replaced by natural gas and renewables, STEPS assumes a nearly 50% drop in oil use by 2030. However, thus far there is little evidence of concrete action being taken in those countries to turn “stated policies” into reality within the next few years. Indeed, data show that in July 2024, Saudi Arabia saw the second-highest monthly oil burn ever for power generation.43\\n\\nWhile the IEA correctly points to such initiatives as the Liquid Fuel Displacement Programme in Saudi Arabia, part of that nation’s overall Vision 2030 economic development and diversification strategy, it is not clear that those plans will be implemented to meet the targets included in STEPS.44 In the IEA’s own words, “specific plans to achieve this objective have not yet been established” (p. 177).\\n\\nThe reduction of oil used in power generation may occur in due course, given many long-term plans, including for local natural gas gathering projects, as well as investments in wind, solar, and nuclear energy. The UAE has three nuclear reactors, and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Iraq have expressed interest in nuclear energy. But none of this will be relevant by 2030.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The growth in petrochemicals and plastics will be slow*\\n\\nThe WEO identifies petrochemicals, today about 20% of global oil use, as the one sector that will see growth through 2035 in both the STEPS and APS (p. 139). Global LPG/ethane and naphtha demand will rise by 14% by 2030. Europe is the exception, where a slight decline is forecast, due to weak economic growth and a shift of petrochemicals manufacturing to Asia.\\n\\nThe WEO joins many other analysts in seeing the growth of petrochemicals in China. Much of that will be driven by the significant and unavoidable use of lots of plastics in the manufacture of EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels, in addition to the universal use of polymers in clothing, packaging, building materials, household goods, medical products, consumer goods, etc. (p. 140).\\n\\nWhile assumptions about recycling are key to forecasting in the plastics sector, the WEO states:[1][O]ver 90 countries have passed a full or partial ban on single-use plastics and more than 20 to establish recycling targets and collection policies. Nonetheless, plastic waste collection for recycling has increased only relatively modestly: 12% of global plastic waste was collected for recycling in 2010, which rose to just 19% in 2023, with marked differences between the collection rates in advanced economies (27%) and emerging market and developing economies (13%). Policy momentum would be boosted by the conclusion of the United Nations’ treaty to end plastic pollution, which has been under negotiation since 2022.45 (p. 120)\\n\\nAfter the WEO was published, the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on the Global Plastics Treaty (INC-5) finished without a deal.46\\n\\nThe WEO notes that there are interesting but uncommercialized technologies to enhance recycling (p. 120), and it suggests unspecified increases in R&D and recycling facilities. But sensible scenarios would include the low probability of that happening soon, or of any global treaty being enacted, or of significantly greater recycling rates after years of exhortation by governments and widespread bans on such things as plastic shopping bags, bottles, and straws.\\n\\nThe 2.7 mmbd of oil demand that WEO’s APS states can be avoided by 2050 is, at best, a questionable assumption (p. 120).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: All scenarios lead to peak oil demand by ~2030*\\n\\nThe WEO’s overarching conclusion, widely repeated in media around the world—and, as noted earlier, often cited as a “forecast”—was that, “even *combining all the high cases, global peaks* for oil . . . would still occur within a few years of those for STEPS, albeit at higher absolute levels” (p. 165; emphasis added).\\n\\nYet it is clear that if the WEO were to have properly included a BAU scenario—which reflected a more realistic range of outcomes associated with known variables for potential oil demands, as outlined above—then peak oil demand would *not* occur in the time frames explored (see **Figure 10**).\\n\\nScenarios based on real-world trends of rising global oil demands should suggest to policymakers that the world could experience, and should plan for, even greater challenges associated with both the affordability and security of oil supplies.\\n\\n### 4. Assumptions Regarding Associated Industries\\n\\nThe WEO’s scenarios are also anchored in numerous other problematic assumptions. We consider, briefly, three other classes of such assumptions: those relating to the availability and prices of critical minerals (a key input for EV costs, and thus adoption); the security of the supplies of those minerals; and the adequacy and security of future petroleum supplies.\\n\\n### *Flawed Assumption: The supply of critical minerals will meet transition goals*\\n\\nThe IEA has recognized and studied the fact that increasing the use of EVs entails a fundamental shift from enormous petroleum liquid supply infrastructures to other enormous infrastructures involving solid materials and chemical refining to produce the batteries. Indeed, in 2021 the IEA issued a seminal report on the nature and quantities of “energy minerals” that will be needed to build the hardware contemplated in the energy-transition scenarios.47\\n\\nThe expansion of mining operations for critical minerals is a linchpin for the achievement of IEA’s long-term energy-transition goals. The agency acknowledges that mining operations are highly capital-intensive and require very long lead times but fails to model the consequences of a world undersupplied with “energy minerals.”\\n\\nIn what constitutes an epic understatement, the WEO observes that for “a number of critical minerals, supply growth from the pipeline of confirmed and announced projects is set to be slower than expected growth in demand” (p. 33). Setting aside optimism about the availability of capital and the absence of environmentalists’ opposition to new mega-mines, the WEO sees a significant near-term, one-decade gap between the supply and demand for minerals needed (see **Figure 11**).\\n\\nFrom outside the IEA, there are now numerous excellent analyses of mineral constraints, many of which do a more creditable job of exploring various metals markets. In a May 2024 report from the International Energy Forum that focused on copper, there is a key conclusion that “just to meet business-as-usual trends, 115% more copper must be mined in the next 30 years than has been mined historically until now. To electrify the global vehicle fleet requires bringing into production 55% more new mines than would otherwise be needed.”48\\n\\nThe WEO is eager to point out that such facts “*should not be interpreted* to mean that energy-transition goals are unattainable due to material constraints” (p. 218; emphasis added). Perhaps—but one sensible interpretation is that the goals could indeed be material-constrained. Failure to incorporate the full range of minerals challenge is a key flaw in the WEO assumptions. Policy makers would reasonably want a scenario that modeled the consequences in terms of what would be feasible in scenarios of insufficient metals supply.\\n\\n### Figure 10A: WEO Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.11.27-PM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 10B: Business as Usual and Possible Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10b-Exec-Sum_Oil-Forecasts-WEO-1-1500x1184.png)\\n\\n### Figure 11: Supply and Demand for “Energy Minerals”\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.03.08-PM.png)\\n\\nThe WEO offers as an overarching idea what can only be termed a naively optimistic faith in markets to solve the minerals problem: “Market *signals should lead* to the development of new projects, although new mining projects tend to have very long lead times” (p. 33; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe idea that “market signals” will result in an adequate supply of critical energy minerals is belied by IEA’s own analysis of the timelines (10–15 years) required for developing new mines. No economist doubts that the word “signal” means higher prices, and necessarily (given long lead times) for very long periods.\\n\\nWhile the WEO observes that “low prices” could lead to mine closures, further constraining supplies, it offers, without specificity in terms of efficacy, a set of aspirational—and some, frankly, risible—policy ideas that, it proposes, could lead industries to increase production:\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Prices of critical minerals will be low*\\n\\nIn a startling acknowledgment, the IEA states: “*We do not yet model* full long-term supply-demand balances for critical minerals in the same way as for fuels” (p. 91; emphasis added). This is a major flaw in a central part of all the WEO scenarios and surprising in its absence, since the IEA identified this knowledge gap nearly four years ago in its own energy minerals study. The WEO notes: “Around 30% of the cost of a battery pack now depends on the cost of critical minerals, and battery costs are increasingly susceptible to mineral price volatility.” And that “there is no alternative at present for some of the critical minerals” (p. 96; see **Figure 12**).\\n\\n### Figure 12: Cathode Raw Material Costs as a Share of EV Battery Prices\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.07.06-PM-1.png)\\n\\nSince a “market signal” of higher prices is essential for supplying adequate materials, it begs the question as to the impact of those prices on the final cost of batteries for EVs (as well as mineral-dependent wind and solar hardware) and derivatively the impediments to consumer adoption. The WEO doesn’t ignore the possibility that “reduced investment [in minerals] *could* lead to future supply shortages and price spikes. This *could* slow reductions in clean energy technology costs, *or even increase them*, as happened in 2022 with battery pack prices, *potentially* clean energy technology deployment” (p. 94; emphases added).\\n\\nThe WEO hedges its rhetoric but not its models, observing that[2]lower [mineral] prices have helped to bring about lower clean technology costs, including a 14% reduction in battery pack costs in 2023 but they are now dampening the investment appetite for new resource developments, with *implications for future* supply diversification (BNEF, 2023). In the case of nickel, for example, three-quarters of operating or potential *projects that are at risk* in today’s price environment are outside the top-three producing countries. If they *close because of low* prices, supply will become further concentrated among the largest suppliers. (p. 216; emphases added)\\n\\nAgain, the IEA does not model these implications. Instead, the WEO, incredibly, simply ignores the possibility of a scenario with higher-, not lower-cost, EVs.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China won’t exercise minerals dominance as an economic or a geopolitical too*\\n\\nThere is rising geopolitical concern over the fact that control of vast stocks of the critical minerals needed for the manufacture of batteries is highly concentrated in a few countries, some of which have geopolitical priorities that have the potential to clash with Western interests. This is true not just for raw materials and refined minerals but also for key components of wind, solar, and battery hardware (see **Figure 13**).\\n\\n### Figure 13: Global Market Shares: Key EV Battery Components\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-11.58.36-AM.png)\\n\\nThe WEO cautions: “Security of clean energy supply chains and critical minerals—The overall level of geographic concentration in manufacturing is therefore set to remain high, even if all announced projects come to fruition” (p. 214). Since, as the WEO also notes, energy mineral resource concentration is far greater than with hydrocarbons, it cautions: “Policy makers need to be alert to the new energy security risks that are emerging in clean energy and look for ways to mitigate them” (p. 33). However, again, there is no attempt to include in scenario models the implications arising from such “resource concentration.”\\n\\nThe IEA points out that China produces 80% of the world’s battery cells. It controls 65% of the global processing capacity for lithium and 75% of the global processing capacity for cobalt. China also produces 50% of the world’s lead (p. 76). A handful of other countries are dominant players in critical minerals. In 2023, half of global nickel production was in Indonesia while 73% of global cobalt production was in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Australia and Chile in 2023 produced 65% of the global total of lithium that year, with China taking a further 13% share. Interestingly, according to the World Economic Forum,49 the U.S. was the world’s leading lithium producer up to 1995, with a one-third share of the total.\\n\\nThis degree of concentration might change in due course. However, as the WEO acknowledges, based on the current pipeline of new mining projects, the concentration of mining activity is unlikely to change: “[S]ome 50–75% of supply growth for refined copper, lithium, and cobalt is projected to come from today’s largest producers, and the same is true for about 90% of battery-grade graphite supply and nickel growth” (p. 217).\\n\\n### Figure 14: Global Annual Investments in Fossil Fuels\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-11.54.06-AM-1.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Oil and gas annual investments are adequate to avoid economic disruptions*\\n\\nThere is an inherent tension in the WEO scenarios regarding the future price and availability of oil. On the one hand, scenarios that see oil in excess supply while demand declines point to lower prices, which, in turn, amplify the cost penalties of avoiding oil use. On the other hand, if scenarios see constrained supply with sustained or higher demand, that self-evidently drives prices up and creates economic headwinds, including broad-based inflation. The latter occurs regardless of scenarios since, in the time frames considered, oil continues to have a dominant role in supply chains and transportation across all energy sectors including, and especially, the energy-intensive mining and minerals domains. Without considering a full range of realistic scenarios for future oil supply, there is little credibility for the WEO conclusion that “*oil prices* in our scenarios act as intermediaries to *balance* *global supply and demand*, ensuring markets remain in equilibrium” (p. 90; emphasis added).\\n\\nAll the WEO scenarios, including STEPS, which constitutes the de facto baseline, assume that: a) fossil fuels will be oversupplied even as governments discourage investment; and thus, b) fossil fuels will be available to “bridge” the unreliability of wind/solar; and c) if oversupply happens, the resultant fossil fuel price collapse will apparently have no feedback effect, encouraging greater use. And those conclusions are reached collaterally with the assumption that there will be continued declines in global investment in fossil fuel exploration and infrastructures (see **Figure 14**).\\n\\nIn STEPS, while oil supply in 2035 is slightly higher than in 2023, the scenario assumes oil demand peaks by 2030, hence putting the world into oversupply. But if, as would be reasonable to model, demand were to continue to grow, then so must supply, which can come only from greater investment to maintain output from current fields and to find new sources of oil. The latter consideration is entirely absent from the NZE scenario, which assumes that no investment in new fields should take place.\\n\\nThe WEO concludes: “Existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure expansions set to come online over the next ten years *should provide* some buffer against potential outages and imply downward pressure on prices” (p. 29; emphasis added).\\n\\nFor policymakers and planners, it would be reasonable, even critical, to model the outcome of insufficient supply; a “should provide” conclusion is risky and flawed. A several mmbd shortfall in global oil supply can trigger inflation-inducing, even recession-inducing, price increases, not to mention political panic.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The future decline rate from existing oil fields will continue historical trends*\\n\\nAll oil (and natural gas) fields experience a natural decline rate in output. This reality means that major ongoing investments are required to find and develop new oil fields wherein the single most important variable, i.e., assumption, is that decline rate. Nowhere in WEO is this issue discussed. The absence of scenarios with faster decline rates leads to overoptimistic outcomes regarding supply.\\n\\nThe IEA does mention the decline-rate issue in its (separate) medium-term oil report stating that the global average field decline rate is about 5%.50 An alternative view was provided in June 2023 by the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which estimated the global rate to be about 6%, an apparently small difference that nonetheless means 1 mmbd less supply than WEO models.51 Some major producing countries have higher decline rates: Brazil’s burgeoning offshore sector has a 13% decline rate, and the U.S. shale oil fields have an estimated annual decline rate of 28%.\\n\\nAnother significant and credible analysis of decline rates was provided in August 2024 by ExxonMobil. It pointed to a current and forecast overall rate of field decline of 15%.52 Exxon, of course, has significant direct experience with the issue as an operator in many countries and produces about 2.5 mmbd. Exxon concluded that “with no new investment, global oil supplies would fall by more than 15 million barrels per day in the first year alone. At that rate, by 2030, oil supplies would fall from 100 million barrels per day to less than 30 million—that’s 70 million barrels short of what’s needed to meet demand every day.”\\n\\nClearly, there will not be a “no new investment” world. However, except for the special case of the U.S. shale sector, investment remains below the 2014 level. This is partly explained by vastly improved discipline in capital and operating expenditures.\\n\\nA reasonable scenario would reflect the fact that investment in upstream oil and gas is likely to grow, not shrink, in the coming years, given the widespread belief in the international oil industry that demand will not fall sharply in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: OPEC will be a reliable cushion to manage oil-supply disruptions*\\n\\nAn important insurance policy for the supply side of the oil industry is the existence of a very large spare production capacity cushion. It is self-evident that unanticipated events, geopolitical crises, or natural calamities can lead to unexpected losses in global oil supply. The WEO appears, by default, to place a lot of faith in OPEC as the primary supplier of spare oil capacity: “If announced capacity additions by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) proceed, the level of demand growth in the STEPS would mean spare capacity rising to 8 mmbd to 2030” (p. 29).\\n\\nAccording to the IEA, members of the OPEC+ oil producers alliance are sitting on 5.6 mmbd of spare production following their decision to cut production to support prices.53 The OPEC+ alliance is composed of members of OPEC (excluding Iran, Venezuela, and Libya) plus Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman, Russia, Sudan, and South Sudan. Forecasting oil production policy for the OPEC+ alliance is always difficult.\\n\\nThe spare production cushion conveys huge power to the alliance. Creating a bigger cushion by reducing production is unlikely in the near term. In either case, sensible models would include the impacts of a smaller “cushion.”\\n\\n## Endnotes\\n\\n## Stay Tuned\\n\\n“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”\\n\\n![NCEA Logo](//energyanalytics.org/wp-content/themes/energyanalytics/images/logo-stacked.svg?v=1718393695)\\n\\nCopyright 2025 National Center for Energy Analytics  \\nAll Rights Reserved  \\n[Privacy Policy](https://energyanalytics.org/privacy/)\\n\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\"\n",

These energy transition scenarios examine outcomes ranging from warming of 1.6°C to 2.9°C by 2100 (scenario descriptions outlined below in sidebar “About the Global Energy Perspective 2023”). These wide-ranging scenarios sketch a range of outcomes based on varying underlying assumptions—for example, about the pace of technological progress and the level of policy enforcement. The scenarios are shaped by more than 400 drivers across sectors, technologies, policies, costs, and fuels, and serve as a fact base to inform decision makers on the challenges to be overcome to enable the energy transition.\\n\\nSidebar\\n\\nAbout the authors\\n-----------------\\n\\nThis article is a collaborative effort by [Luciano Di Fiori](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/luciano-di-fiori), Cherry Ding, Enrico Furnari, [Micah Smith](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/micah-smith), and Pawel Wilczynski, representing views from McKinsey Energy Solutions.\\n\\nGrowing global momentum could accelerate the energy transition, as demonstrated by the UAE Consensus, released in December 2023, that calls on Parties to make a just and orderly transition away from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, analysis from multiple sources, including the IEA, IPCC, and McKinsey, suggests that conventional fossil fuels are likely to remain a part of the energy mix to 2050, even in a 1.5° pathway, and may act as a bridge for an orderly transition. Therefore, decarbonizing the fossil fuel system and substantially reducing emissions, including methane, is a key area of focus. Within that evolving context, this article examines the potential road ahead for oil according to our sector-based adoption models.

According to our analysis,[1 To assess the different paths forward, McKinsey has established sector-based adoption models, in which it analyses model sector- and country-based adoption speeds of new technologies given a range of underlying insights and assumptions. These include existing and expected regulation, costs, asset lifetimes, supply chains, technological learning curves, and economic optimization as a system.](javascript:void(0);) demand could fall by up to 50 percent by 2050, depending on the scenario modelled. However, even under the most accelerated scenario, the analysis shows that investment in a broad energy mix, including oil and gas, would continue for a period in order to shore-up security of supply and meet demand across the range of scenarios, particularly in end-use sectors such as chemicals, aviation, and heavy trucking. As a result, our bottom-up energy transition scenarios consistently see a certain amount of new field development continuing in order to meet overall energy demand, offset rapid production declines, and to meet transition energy shortfalls. Furthermore, our scenarios see investment in the oil and gas sector, both for fuel and non-fuel purposes, remaining robust through 2030 as the world navigates an orderly and affordable transition.\\n\\nGrowing energy efficiency and EV uptake could advance the timeline for oil demand decline\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter a steep decline due to COVID-19, oil demand increased to pre-pandemic levels in 2023 at 101.7 million barrels per day (MMb/d). However, growth may not last long, as peak demand is projected to materialize before 2030 across our four bottom-up energy transition scenarios.\\n\\nThe four scenarios align on a relatively close timing of peak oil demand between 2025 and 2030, driven by efficiency gains across sectors and growing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in passenger cars. Energy efficiency (including electrification) spending made up two-thirds of overall government investments in clean energy in the last two years, and the continued electrification of transport has contributed significantly to the reduced demand for oil.[1 _Energy Efficiency 2022_, International Energy Agency, 2022.](javascript:void(0);) In particular, growing uptake of EVs is expected to contribute to between 5 and 10 MMb/d of oil demand reduction by 2030, and is the major differentiating driver of peak demand between scenarios.\\n\\n![Image 2: Oil demand is expected to peak by 2030 across all scenarios, with a wide variation of 2050 demand.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex1.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Demand in the light-duty segment would decline across all scenarios as the proportion of EVs among cars on the road reaches between 55 and 80 percent by 2050, contributing to a decline in oil demand by 2050 of between 15 and 25 MMb/d.\\n\\nHeavy transport (such as long-haul duty trucks) could have a more uncertain outlook. While demand in this segment would continue to grow in the Fading Momentum scenario, advancements in both battery technology and hydrogen could enable large-scale decarbonization in the Achieved Commitments scenario, resulting in a decline of around 10 MMb/d compared to today.\\n\\nOn the other hand, despite the expected overall decline in global oil demand by 2050, our analysis shows that oil could still provide considerable supply to end-use sectors, such as aviation and chemicals, where decarbonization options, such as [sustainable fuels](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/global-energy-perspective-2023-sustainable-fuels-outlook), are not yet cost competitive in many cases, or where oil is used as a feedstock instead of as a fuel. In fact, chemicals and aviation are the only sectors where demand continues to grow to 2050 in all our bottom-up energy transition scenarios, driven by increased demand for plastic and travel, respectively. These sectors could account for almost 50 percent of global oil demand by 2050 (compared to around 22 percent today).\\n\\nHowever, in the Achieved Commitments scenario, up to 50 percent of aviation demand would be supplied by bio- and syn-kerosene, which have low or zero emissions due to the sequestered carbon in the production process.\\n\\n![Image 3: Road transport is the largest contributor to the oil demand decline, with demand in chemicals and aviation continuing to grow.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex2-v14.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

This would happen even sooner under the Achieved Commitments scenario assumptions.\\n\\nFor any new capital expenditure in oil, parties will need to consider actions to enable a just and orderly transition away from fossil fuels in the coming decades and accelerate efforts globally towards net zero-emission energy systems, utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century.\\n\\nGiven the fact that it accounts for around 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the oil and gas industry can play an important role in reducing emissions, mostly notably in methane reduction, which represents around 45 percent of all oil and gas emissions globally and generates a temperature impact that is 80 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year timeframe.[4 International Energy Agency; UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.](javascript:void(0);) There has recently been acceleration in this area; for example, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), launched at COP28 in December 2023, commits signatories to achieving net-zero operations by 2050 across Scope one and two emissions, near-zero methane in upstream operations by 2030, and zero routine flaring by 2030.\\n\\nThe oil supply mix is projected to shift\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nLooking in detail at the Current Trajectory scenario, the supply mix would shift to three main sources under the assumptions of that scenario:\\n\\n*   OPEC Middle East would continue to hold low-cost reserves, with a broadly flat output. The region produces the lowest-cost oil, and key players favor long-term market stability.\\n*   Shale oil would add 17 percent to the 2022 baseline (1.7 MMb/d), plateauing in the 2030s.\\n*   Deepwater output would grow by 12 percent compared to the 2022 baseline and peak before 2040, unless significant discoveries are made (such as in Guyana, Namibia, and Suriname), despite the overall shrinking trend in offshore output. In offshore, deepwater is likely to see the most growth.\\n\\nEffectively, 24 MMb/d of yet unsanctioned production outside of OPEC Middle East would be needed to meet 2040 supply projections under our Current Trajectory scenario, with nearly 21 MMb/d coming from shale and offshore assets. These increases would be offset by reductions in other conventional and shallow water reservoirs, resulting in lower supply by 2040 to meet lower demand.\\n\\n![Image 4: By 2040, the supply mix is projected to shift to OPEC Middle East, shale oil, and deepwater output.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex4.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

The outlook is driven predominantly by the Permian Basin, where production is expected to grow through the mid-2030s before potentially plateauing at around 7 MMb/d by 2040.\\n\\nThree factors could impact the future growth of North American shale production:\\n\\n*   The capital discipline of public operators and uncertainty around future long-term consistency.\\n*   Potential energy transition trends and local policy impacting supply growth.\\n*   Permian Basin productivity gains, which represent a major driver of production growth, and which have begun to plateau.\\n\\n![Image 5: North America shale oil production is expected to plateau at approximately 10MMb/d, driven by the Permian Basin.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex5.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: [McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com](mailto:McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com)\\n\\nThe evolution of oil demand would impact future prices\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe price dynamics that oil could see in the short and longer terms is an important consideration for the energy transition. Under the Current Trajectory scenario, based on fundamental analysis of currently identified resources, the market is projected to reach a long-term price equilibrium in 2040 within a range of $50 to $60 per barrel ($ real, 2022), or $90 to $100 per barrel (nominal). Marginal production is expected from offshore deepwater projects. This assumes production restraint by lowest cost producers, which in some cases see break-evens of around $10 per barrel.\\n\\nHence, given the wide range of demand scenarios and price outlooks, oil and gas companies may have to carefully manage decline in demand to avoid the risk of stranded assets, while at the same time ensuring that they are future-proofed with investments in energy transition opportunities, as many have already started doing.\\n\\n![Image 6: Demand is projected to decline by around 10 MMb/d by 2040 in the Current Trajectory scenario, allowing the market to balance at $50-60/bbl.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex6-v20.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Despite this cumulative increase, annual demand growth is expected to shrivel from 2.4 mb/d this year to just 0.4 mb/d in 2028, putting a peak in demand in sight.\\n\\nIn particular, the use of oil for transport fuels is set to go into decline after 2026 as the expansion of electric vehicles, the growth of biofuels and improving fuel economy reduce consumption.\\n\\n“The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Oil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition.”\\n\\nGlobal oil markets are still slowly recalibrating after three turbulent years in which they were upended first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The global energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine has resulted in an unprecedented reshuffling of global trade flows. Global oil markets could tighten significantly in the coming months, as production cuts by the OPEC+ alliance temper an upswing in global oil supplies. However, the multifaceted strains on markets look set to ease in the following years, according to the new report.\\n\\nChina was the last major economy to lift its stringent Covid-19 restrictions at the end of 2022, leading to a post-pandemic oil demand rebound in the first half of 2023. But demand growth in China is forecast to slow markedly from 2024 onwards. Nevertheless, burgeoning petrochemical demand and strong consumption growth in emerging and developing economies will more than offset a contraction in advanced economies.\\n\\nGlobal upstream investments in oil and gas exploration, extraction and production are on course to reach their highest levels since 2015, growing 11% year-on-year to USD 528 billion in 2023. While the impact of higher spending will be partly offset by cost inflation, this level of investment, if sustained, would be adequate to meet forecast demand in the period covered by the report. However, it exceeds the amount that would be needed in a world that gets on track for net zero emissions.\\n\\nThe report’s projections assume major oil producers maintain their plans to build up capacity even as demand growth slows. This is expected to result in a spare capacity cushion of at least 3.8 mb/d, concentrated in the Middle East. The report nonetheless notes a number of factors that could affect market balances over the medium term – including uncertain global economic trends, the direction of OPEC+ decisions and China’s refining industry policy.\\n\\nOil producing countries outside the OPEC+ alliance dominate plans for increasing global supply capacity in the medium term, with an expected rise of 5.1 mb/d by 2028 led by the United States, Brazil and Guyana. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq lead the plans for capacity building within OPEC+, while African and Asian members are set to struggle with continuing declines, and Russian production falls due to sanctions. This makes for a net capacity gain of 0.8 mb/d from the 23 members in OPEC+ overall over the report’s forecast period.\\n\\nIn the refining sector, the overhang in global capacity has been reduced by waves of closures, conversions to biofuel plants and project delays since the pandemic. This, combined with a sharp drop in Chinese oil product exports and an upheaval of Russian trade flows, resulted in record profits for the industry last year. While the amount of net refinery capacity additions by 2028 is expected to outpace demand growth for refined products, diverging trends among products means that a repeat of the 2022 tightness in middle distillates cannot be ruled out.\\n\\n##### Oil 2023\\n\\n[Explore report](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2023)\\n\\n###### The Energy Mix\\n\\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n[View sample](https://iea.li/energy-mix-sample) [Explore our other newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\n\\n*   Browse\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\n*   [Countries & regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\n\\n*   Explore\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\n*   [Data & statistics](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)\\n\\n*   Learn\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\n\\n*   Connect\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\n\\n*   Follow\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\n\\n©IEA 2025\\n\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028#header)\\n\\n#### Subscription successful\\n\\nThank you for subscribing.

Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5. [...] Growth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. [...] Divergent regional economic trajectories and the accelerating deployment of clean and energy-saving technologies are combining to progressively slow the pace of oil demand growth, with a plateau emerging in the final years of our forecast, which runs to 2030. Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply.\",\n",

Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply.\\n\\nRising world oil supplies, led by non‑OPEC+ producers, are expected to surpass forecast demand from 2025 onwards. Mirroring demand’s break with long-term trends, a front-loaded build in oil production capacity is forecast to lose momentum and swing into contraction towards the end of our medium-term outlook. A surge in natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensates will account for 45% of new capacity increases over the forecast period. In a major shift in strategy, Saudi Arabia has put on hold its planned crude oil capacity increase and will now focus on expanding natural gas liquids and condensates, which aligns with its efforts to boost domestic gas supply. It may also reflect an acknowledgment of the rapidly building surplus in global crude oil production capacity. The rise of petrochemicals as the main pillar of global demand growth largely tracks the substantial increase in global supply of NGLs, which are instrumental in their production.\\n\\nAt the same time, these changes will also create new challenges for refiners as demand for refined products is displaced by non-refined products such as NGLs and biofuels. Non-refined fuels are set to capture a staggering three-quarters of projected global demand growth over the 2023-2030 period. Moreover, refiners will need to reconfigure their product slates to meet divergent trends for distillates amid reduced consumption as the energy transition accelerates. This is especially the case in road transport fuels as EVs rapidly increase their market share.\\n\\nAmid all these structural changes to supply and demand patterns, the global oil market outlook faces further uncertainties from weaker macroeconomic expectations, new government policies and regulations to fast-track the energy transition, and an unprecedented level of investment to scale up more efficient technologies.\\n\\nWhile the challenges are formidable, the industry has consistently proved its adaptability to dramatic supply and demand changes, including from the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic before that.\\n\\n#### Surplus global supply capacity will reach unprecedented levels by 2030\\n\\nA ramping up of world oil production capacity, led by the United States and other producers in the Americas, is expected to outstrip demand growth over the 2023‑2030 forecast period and inflate the world’s spare capacity cushion to levels that are unprecedented, barring the Covid-19 period. Total supply capacity rises by 6 mb/d to nearly 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a staggering 8 mb/d above projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d.\\n\\n### OPEC+ spare crude production capacity and implied total oil stock build, 2016-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/opec-spare-crude-production-capacity-and-implied-total-oil-stock-build-2016-2030)\\n\\nSuch a massive cushion could upend the current OPEC+ market management strategy aimed at supporting prices. For now, the producer alliance has laid out a roadmap for unwinding extra voluntary cuts of up to 2.2 mb/d from Q4 2024 to Q3 2025\\\\. But this outlook is subject to their caveat that the production increases can be paused or reversed depending on market conditions.\\n\\nA lower price environment would ultimately challenge the US shale industry, traditionally the fastest respondent to changing market circumstances. How the industry will adapt and adjust to the new supply landscape will have wide-ranging consequences for producers and consumers globally through the remainder of the decade and beyond.\\n\\n#### World oil demand tempered by clean energy transition\\n\\nBased on today’s market conditions and policies, global oil demand will level off at around 106 mb/d towards the end of the decade amid the accelerating transition to clean energy technologies. Surging EV sales and continued efficiency improvements of vehicles, and the substitution of oil with renewables or gas in the power sector, will significantly curb oil use in road transport and electricity generation.\\n\\nTotal oil demand is nevertheless forecast to rise by 3.2 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, supported by increased use of jet fuel and feedstocks from the booming petrochemical sector. Indeed, consumption of naphtha, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane will climb by 3.7 mb/d over the forecast period, fuelled also by growth in LPG use for clean cooking.\\n\\n### Global oil demand forecast, 2017-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-oil-demand-forecast-2017-2030)\\n\\n### Growth in oil demand, 2022-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/growth-in-oil-demand-2022-2030)\\n\\nGrowth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. Significant gains will also come from other emerging and developing economies in Asia. By contrast, demand in advanced economies will continue its decades-long decline, falling from 45.7 mb/d in 2023 to 42.7 mb/d by 2030\\\\. Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5.\\n\\n#### Upstream investments and oil supply on the rise\\n\\nIn line with the ascendancy of petrochemicals as the anchor of global oil demand growth, 45% of the supply capacity increase over the forecast period comes from NGLs and condensates. While Saudi Arabia has shelved its planned crude capacity increase from 12 mb/d to 13 mb/d, its development of the massive Jafurah gas field will move ahead. This will result in a substantial ramping up of gas liquids output of almost 1 mb/d by 2030, volumes that are not subject to OPEC+ quotas. Strong gains in US NGLs are also expected. Total NGLs and condensates are projected to rise by 2.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030. By comparison, crude oil production capacity is forecast to increase by 2.6 mb/d over the same period, while biofuels account for 620 kb/d of the 6 mb/d total.\\n\\nNon-OPEC+ producers will continue to lead the capacity build, accounting for 4.6 mb/d, or 76% of the net increase. The United States alone makes up 2.1 mb/d of the non-OPEC+ gains, while Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina contribute a further 2.7 mb/d. As the sanctioned project queue fizzles out towards the end of our forecast, growth stalls in the United States and Canada while Brazil and Guyana shift into decline based on current plans. However, should companies swiftly approve additional projects that are already on the drawing board, an incremental 1.3 mb/d of non‑OPEC+ capacity could become operational by 2030.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq lead a 1.4 mb/d rise in OPEC+ oil capacity as African and Asian members post declines. The UAE and Iraq are raising crude oil capacity while Saudi Arabia is poised for a significant increase NGL and condensates supply. Capacity in Russia is expected to show only a marginal decline despite international sanctions as the giant Vostok project ramps up, helping to offset losses at mature oil fields.\\n\\nThe boost in supply follows a steady increase in upstream investments. Global upstream capital expenditures rose by 13% to an eight-year high of USD 538 billion in 2023 and are on track to increase by another 7% this year.\\n\\n#### Refiners adjust to slowing demand for refined fuels\\n\\nGlobal refining capacity is forecast to rise by 3.3 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, well below historical trends. Even with the moderate expansion in capacity, the increase outpaces the call on refined products over the period.\\n\\nRefiners will need to progressively modify their product output to meet divergent trends for distillates as gasoline demand falls amid an increase in the market share of electric vehicles while jet fuel consumption rises. In addition, non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels further undermine demand for refined product supplies and the need for additional refining capacity. Non-refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of projected demand growth over the 2023-2030 period.\\n\\nThis significant rise in non-refinery product supplies will add pressure on operating rates and refinery profitability, especially in mature demand centres. That raises the prospect of further capacity closures by the end of the decade. Capacity growth will remain concentrated in Asia, most notably in China and India, but post‑2027 there are signs of expansions slowing.\\n\\n#### Global oil trade will continue its eastward shift\\n\\nGlobal oil trade will continue to be dictated by Asia’s growing structural shortfall in crude and product supply and the expanding surplus of crude, NGLs and products in the Atlantic Basin. Rising non-OPEC+ crude supply, in tandem with sanctions on Russian crude exports and OPEC+ voluntary cuts, will push higher volumes from the Atlantic Basin to East of Suez over the outlook period.\\n\\n### Net crude oil exports versus Asian import requirement, 2019-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/net-crude-oil-exports-versus-asian-import-requirement-2019-2030)\\n\\nThe loss of medium sour crudes from the Middle East amid OPEC+ cuts is partially offset by rising supplies from Brazil, Guyana and Canada. Asian markets have been opened in earnest to Canadian crude through the expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline to the Pacific Coast. Light sweet US crude oil will increasingly move to Europe and Africa as well as to India and other Asian refiners.\\n\\nAs the dominant centre of oil product demand growth, Asia will attract a greater share of product supply from the broader region, notably from the Middle East. Supplies from Russia, which are subject to sanctions in much of the Atlantic Basin, will continue to head eastward, although Africa and Latin America may also boost imports over time. Europe’s shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition most keenly in the middle distillate markets.\\n\\n###### The Energy Mix\\n\\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n[View sample](https://iea.li/energy-mix-sample) [Explore our other newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\n\\n*   Browse\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\n*   [Countries & regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\n\\n*   Explore\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\n*   [Data & statistics](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)\\n\\n*   Learn\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\n\\n*   Connect\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\n\\n*   Follow\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\n\\n©IEA 2025\\n\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024/executive-summary#header)\\n\\n#### Subscription successful\\n\\nThank you for subscribing.

Prentiss, PhD ; Sarah A. Sydlowski, AuD, PhD, MBA; Camille C. Dunn, PhD, CCC-A The indications for cochlear implantation have expanded over time due to evidence demonstrating identiﬁcation and implanta-tion of appropriate cochlear implant (CI) candidates lead to signiﬁcant improvements in speech recognition and quality of life (QoL). However, clinical practice is variable, with some providers using outdated criteria and others exceeding current labeled indications. As a results, only a fraction of those persons who could beneﬁt from CI technology receive it. This document sum-marizes the current evidence for determining appropriate referrals for adults with bilateral hearing loss into CI centers for for-mal evaluation by stressing the importance of treating each ear individually and a “revised 60/60 rule”. By mirroring contemporary clinical practice and available evidence, these recommendations will also provide a standardized testing protocol for CI candidates using a team-based approach that prioritizes individualized patient care. This manuscript was developed by the Adult Cochlear Implantation Candidacy Task Force of the American Cochlear Implant Alliance using review of the existing literature and clinical consensus.\\nKey Words: adult, candidacy, cochlear implant, evidence, protocol, recommendation.\\nLevel of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 00:1–14, 2023 BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, improvements in cochlear implant (CI) technology, increased awareness of the technology, and changes in candidacy criteria have led to a rapid growth of evidence in the literature regard-ing the beneﬁt of CI in adults. As such, recommendations for CI candidacy and referral continue to evolve. For instance, unlike historical CI recipients with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), CI candi-dates may now have an audiogram that mirrors or over-laps that seen in a hearing aid (HA) candidate and may have hearing in the contralateral ear up to and including normal hearing. Yet, the low utilization of CIs suggests hearing health care providers unfamiliar with current candidacy criteria may be relying on older, stricter criteria for referring potential CI candidates.\\nTo assist in the standardization of practice, CI man-ufacturers have relied upon device labeling from national healthcare governing bodies (i.e., Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). However, labeling has not kept pace with clinical practice. Many commercial payers use FDA labeling to inform their coverage policies, while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a coverage determination policy that dictates payment for CI services. As a result, some patients who may beneﬁt from CI technology yet fall outside of FDA labeling and/or CMS candidacy criteria are prevented from pursuing the technology. The inconsistency among clinical best prac-tice, labeling, and coverage determination policies can create wide variability in practice methods and may lead to the inconsistent provision of CI services on a national, regional, and even a local level. Using established evi-dence, the recommendations summarized in this manu-script will serve to standardize the approach and testing protocol for determining adult candidacy for a CI and highlight the importance of a multi-disciplinary team-based approach for individualized patient care.\\nUNDERUTILIZATION OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION An estimated 466 million persons worldwide live with disabling hearing loss (>6.1% of the world’s popula-tion).\\nOver 40 million people in the United States (US) alone suffer from disabling hearing loss (4.6%).1,2 In persons 12-years-and-older, the prevalence of bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss is estimated to be approx-imately two million1 making hearing loss the third most prevalent chronic health condition in the US.1–3 With the advent of the ﬁrst multi-channel CI system in 1985, guidelines requiring bilateral severe-to-profound SNHL to qualify for CI became the standard of care.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License expected that hundreds of thousands if not millions of persons would have been implanted over the last four decades. However, as of 2015, 170,252 US adults have been implanted out of an estimated 1,337,144 traditional audiometric CI candidates for a utilization rate of 12.7%.4 Moreover, fewer than 1 million devices have been implanted worldwide.5 The under-penetration of CIs among adult candi-dates is multifactorial and may in part be explained by poor awareness among clinicians and consumers alike.\\nUnfamiliarity with current candidacy criteria, lack of awareness of referral processes and clear referral path-ways to a CI center, and ﬁnancial incentives to sell hear-ing instruments may all contribute.6,7 In addition, hearing healthcare providers currently performing adult CI evaluations demonstrate considerable variability in their testing methodologies and in the deﬁnition of a “good candidate”, leading to inconsistent referrals.8 Last, patients unaware of CI technology, or those unfamiliar with candidacy criteria, may lack the impetus to discuss their options for hearing rehabilitation with their pri-mary care physician, and vice versa. Collectively, these factors likely result in missed opportunities for persons with hearing impairment to be considered for CI.9 As technology has improved and outcomes data have been analyzed, candidacy has gradually expanded to include patients with increasing amounts of residual acoustic hearing and higher aided speech recognition scores (Table I). Evidence now demonstrates FDA device labeling is not always consistent with current clinical practice. An increasing number of patients with hearing loss who fall outside of labeling guidelines are receiving CIs10 and often demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt.11 For example, increasing numbers of patients with asymmetric SNHL (ASNHL) are undergoing CI in their poorer hear-ing ear and demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt in both the implanted ear only condition and when using the CI and the contralateral HA together (bimodal, binaural condition).11–14 In addition, adults with unilateral severe-to-profound SNHL (USNHL) in the poorer ear and thresholds better than or equal to 20 dB HL in the unaf-fected ear (single-sided deafness; SSD) are now undergo-ing CI, and the results have been positive.15–18 Recipients demonstrate improved speech understanding in noise, improved sound source localization, reduction in tinnitus, improved QoL, and increased quality of hearing compared with other available technologies for SSD such as bone conduction implants and contralateral routing of signal HAs.19–24 Furthermore, using a CI in one ear does not alter or decrease performance on the contralateral side, even in cases of normal acoustic hearing.25,26 There have been two versions of a recommended Minimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB)27 and a third is currently in development. Although both versions recom-mend inclusion of a variety of test conditions (ear-speciﬁc and bilaterally aided; sentences in quiet and both ﬁxed and pseudo-adaptive noise, and monosyllabic words), the suggested materials have evolved over time. Speciﬁcally, HINT sentences were replaced by AzBio Sentences28 which were shown to be more ecologically valid.29 How-ever, the MSTB never speciﬁcally suggested how to use the recommended materials to determine CI candidacy.\\nAs the criteria for CI continue to broaden, the materials and methods used to test potential CI candidates remain highly variable and open to interpretation, even for tradi-tional, bilaterally deafened candidates.8 This variability has led to inconsistencies between testing centers making comparison of objective outcomes between patients more difﬁcult and may impair the successful prognostication of postoperative outcomes.30 In addition to objective measures, such as speech recognition scores and severity of hearing loss, determin-ing whether a patient is a CI candidate relies on a cen-ter’s familiarity with outcomes, expanding criteria, and comfort recommending implantation for those outside of FDA indications. Although a few authors have published evidence-based criteria for recommending a CI,31 there is limited guidance regarding how other factors such as cog-nitive ability, willingness to participate in an aural reha-bilitation program, duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation use among others should be used in the can-didacy process.\\nBy developing and implementing standardized rec-ommendations for assessing and conﬁrming CI candidacy, uniformity in testing protocols will be improved, the num-ber of potential CI recipients referred for testing will be increased, and consistency between those considered CI candidates amongst centers will be enhanced. Ultimately this standardization will lead to increased penetration of CI technology to those who could most beneﬁt.\\nMETHODS The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based rec-ommendations for CI candidacy identiﬁcation and referrals based on a comprehensive review of the literature. The recom-mendations encompassed in this article were developed following a predetermined methodological approach which included: (1) determining the need for a set of formal recommendations regarding adult cochlear implant candidacy and navigation of the CI referral pathway by the American Cochlear Implant Alli-ance (ACI Alliance) Board of Directors (BOD); (2) the formation of a team of subject matter experts in the ﬁeld to serve as co-authors and the designation of a lead author; (3) numerous teleconferences to establish the rationale and methodology for development of the recommendations; (4) performing a compre-hensive literature review assisted by medical librarians identify-ing the most up-to-date and state-of-the-art manuscripts on the topics of CI candidacy and referral guidelines; (5) the formation of the recommendations and the creation of an evidence-based pathway as guided by assimilation of the data based on the liter-ature review; (6) a period of review and public comment by the ACI Alliance BOD followed by a unanimous vote of endorsement.\\nThe comprehensive literature review was conducted with the help of medical librarians using a combination of keywords related to cochlear implants from multiple databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Dyna Med, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The articles were reviewed by the authors based on relevance and strength of evidence. The relevant articles were grouped into subtopics (i.e., aided speech recognition testing, can-didacy referral recommendations), and the recommendations were formulated based upon discussion, analysis, and data syn-thesis by all authors.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 3 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Several authors have published parameters to help determine the appropriateness of an adult CI referral and predict the likelihood the candidate will qualify. Gubbels et al. used audiometric ﬁndings to identify patients who are likely to meet CI candidacy fol-lowing formal testing.32 Speciﬁcally, patients with low frequency (250, 500, 1000 Hz) thresholds greater than 75 dB HL and/or a monosyllabic word recognition test score of <40% have a greater than 80% probability of meeting CMS criteria at the time of publication (i.e., <40% sentence recognition score bilaterally in the best-aided condition). When using only a monosyllabic word score <32%, 86% of the patients met CMS criteria.\\nIn patients with private insurance, the accuracy of the model remained strong (>80%) if the monosyllabic word recognition test score was <45%.\\nZwolan et al. performed a similar analysis in which audiometric data were used to predict patients who would qualify for CI under the same CMS criteria.33 When only those patients who met traditional CI indications (i.e., consistent with Medicare coverage guidelines of <40% bilateral sentence recognition score at the time of study publication) were considered, 95% had a preopera-tive pure-tone-average (PTA) in their better hearing ear of 60 dB HL or greater and 92% had an unaided monosyl-labic word score of 60% or lower. When applied retrospec-tively to a large sample of adult CI candidates, this “60/60 guideline” yielded a 96% sensitivity rate (i.e., candidates met both criteria) and a 65% speciﬁcity rate (i.e., non-candidates did not meet the 60/60 criteria).\\nAlthough the Zwolan paper uses a 60/60 guideline in the better hearing ear as a guideline for referral, due to FDA approval for cochlear implantation in cases of asym-metrical hearing loss and single-sided deafness, a “revised 60/60 guideline” is recommended where post-lingually deafened adults are referred for CI evaluations when one or both ears demonstrate a monosyllabic word score that is less than or equal to 60% correct and the unaided PTA (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) is greater than or equal to 60 dB HL. It is important clinicians recognize use of this guideline will only capture the most clear-cut CI candidates and may overlook candidates who still meet FDA criteria with steeply sloping hearing loss.\\nUsing objective audiological data will help hearing health professionals make high-yield and appropriate CI evaluation referrals. However, it is important to recognize that other studies demonstrate a poor correlation between unaided speech recognition scores and eventual CI candidacy.34 Therefore, if a patient demonstrates lim-ited beneﬁt from appropriately ﬁt hearing aids, it is important to consider referral for a formal CI evaluation regardless of the performance on any single test or group of testing measures.\\nIn summary, hearing health professionals should use the revised 60/60 guideline and refer any patient with an unaided PTA of 60 dB HL or greater and an unaided word score of 60% or less in one or both ears for formal CI evaluation. Importantly, those patients falling outside of the revised 60/60 guideline or those falling outside of tra-ditional CI labeling who do not receive adequate beneﬁt from their current technology (i.e., unilateral SNHL, asymmetric SNHL, low frequency thresholds in the nor-mal to mild range) should also be referred for a formal CI evaluation. Although other information will be reviewed by the CI team prior to candidacy determination, using audiometric parameters such as these ensures a greater number of potential CI candidates will undergo consider-ation. If the patient is deemed a non-candidate following formal CI candidacy evaluation, the referring hearing health professional should monitor the patient’s perfor-mance and re-refer with worsening performance or ongo-ing hearing difﬁculties.\\nCOCHLEAR IMPLANT CANDIDACY CONSIDERATIONS The adult CI candidacy evaluation should involve a multi-disciplinary team with experience treating CI patients. Typically, a CI team includes a CI surgeon(s) and audiologist(s) specializing in CI. Based on the com-plexity of the candidate’s case, the pre-, peri-, and/or post-operative needs of the candidate, and/or the customs of a particular CI center, additional team members may include a rehabilitation specialist (auditory-based thera-pist), a neuro-radiologist, psychologists/neuropsycholo-gists, social worker(s), previously implanted peers, and family members/caregivers.\\nIn addition to audiometric thresholds and aided sen-tence recognition in quiet,8,34 other information must be obtained during the hearing health history including ear-speciﬁc aided speech recognition using monosyllabic words and sentences in noise, etiology and duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation, patient’s occupation and/or social hearing needs, demographics (i.e., social support, age, hearing needs such as occupation), decre-ment in hearing speciﬁc and/or overall quality of life (QoL), motivation, and underlying medical factors.\\nAlthough speciﬁc recommendations based on these vari-ables may differ between individual clinics, this holistic approach towards the CI candidate has been shown to be beneﬁcial as part of healthy aging in CI recipi-ents35 (Fig. 1).\\nMultiple hearing health variables have been shown to correlate with CI outcomes including duration of deafness,36–41 HA usage,42 age at implantation,43 and eti-ology of hearing loss.36,39,42 There is evidence that addi-tional demographic variables may also be determinants of Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 4 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License future performance following CI. Tang and colleagues44 showed factors including cohabitation with a spouse or family member(s), familiarity with technology, emotional intelligence, and adherence to postoperative aural reha-bilitation programs can inﬂuence speech outcomes follow-ing CI. Therefore, during the CI evaluation process it is critical to discuss factors such as resources available to the CI candidate and family, a family’s willingness to pro-vide a strong support system, a commitment to post-implantation (re)habilitation, the proximity of the patient to the CI audiologist and/or qualiﬁed (re)habilitation pro-vider, and the willingness and ability of the patient to wear the device.\\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND HEARING NEEDS Although a diagnostic audiogram provides objective information, it does not accurately represent the patient’s functional status as a result of their hearing loss. Speciﬁ-cally, it does not reﬂect the impact the hearing loss has on the patient in their everyday life (i.e., auditory fatigue, cognitive load, etc.) resulting from routine communication disabilities. It is well known that severe-to-profound hearing loss can have signiﬁcant consequences on one’s mental health, social inclusivity, and overall QoL.45 Research demonstrates the advantages CIs have over HAs on the recipient’s QoL in multiple domains including psychosocial health, functional health, and social inclu-sion.46,47 Despite the superiority of CI over HAs in these domains and others, CI penetration in the US has remained stagnant.9 Some evidence even suggests that the duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss prior to CI surgery is increasing, further exacerbating the delete-rious effects on the patient’s QoL.48 Although a CI may not be the optimal approach for every patient who qualiﬁes audiometrically, understanding each person’s hearing needs, communication goals, and QoL detriment are essential in providing additional insight for counsel-ing on realistic expectations. Furthermore, each candi-date must demonstrate a motivation for and commitment to the entire CI process.\\nAUDIOLOGIC EVALUATION Hearing History Obtaining an accurate and comprehensive hearing health history is critical to identifying appropriate CI candidates and understanding factors that may inﬂuence outcomes post-operatively. Information regarding the eti-ology of hearing loss (if known), rate of hearing loss pro-gression (supplemented by prior audiometric testing where available), history of ampliﬁcation, otologic history (i.e., prior operations and/or pathology), and post-implant expectations must be obtained during the clinic evalua-tion. In addition, age at onset of hearing loss and its rela-tionship to language acquisition must be queried as these factors may help predict postoperative outcomes and/or device use compliance.49,50 Speciﬁcally, adult candidates with pre-lingual onset of deafness demonstrate large inter-individual performance variability and levels of sat-isfaction and may be at increased risk for device non-use.51,52 Careful attention to duration of deafness is essential when discussing realistic expectations with the candidate.\\nDuration of deafness can be difﬁcult to accurately assess in some patients. An understanding of the estimated amount of time that the inner ear and auditory cortex has been without meaningful stimulation is critical as it is an important predictor of post-operative objective suc-cess.\\nLack of stimulation may be due to severe-to-profound hearing loss, lack of adequate ampliﬁcation, and/or failure to engage in auditory-rich environments.\\nAs discussed above, longer durations of post-lingual deaf-ness are associated with poorer outcomes after CI.36–41 However, successful outcomes following CI in cases of prolonged durations of deafness (>30 years) have been reported.53 Therefore, duration of deafness in bilaterally deafened adults with a post-lingual onset should not be an absolute contraindication for CI, but rather an impor-tant consideration in setting appropriate post-implantation expectations.\\nIn addition to age of onset and duration of deafness, the duration and consistency of ampliﬁcation use in impaired ears must be determined. Even with consistent ampliﬁcation, long-term severe-to-profound hearing loss can lead to auditory deprivation and may impact out-comes following CI.40,41,54 Critically, the ﬁt and settings of current ampliﬁcation must be veriﬁed by the CI audiol-ogist as many potential CI candidates arrive with inap-propriately ﬁt HAs at the time of the evaluation.8 The etiology of the candidate’s hearing loss should be obtained and documented. CI outcomes can vary widely among recipients based on the etiology of hearing loss and must be reviewed with the patient.55–59 Fig. 1.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Although very few etiologies of deafness are contraindica-tions to CI surgery, they may impact expected outcomes and must be considered when discussing realistic expec-tations with the patient.\\nDuring the hearing health history, the CI candidate should be asked to share the impact the hearing loss has on their daily life. It is important to understand how the hearing loss impairs or affects the candidate’s ability to work, communicate with friends and family, or interact socially. It is helpful to ask patient-speciﬁc, closed-ended questions that clarify the impact of their hearing loss (i.e., “Can you use a telephone with one or both ears?”, “Can you watch television without subtitles?”, “Can you go out to dinner with friends and keep up with the con-versation?”, “Do you feel your HAs provide sufﬁcient ben-eﬁt?”).\\nMany clinics are using validated screening questionnaires such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Test (HHIE-S)60 to better understand the impact of the candidate’s hearing loss.\\nThis should be repeated post-operatively and shared with the patient by discussing areas of beneﬁt and areas that the patient could beneﬁt from additional rehabilitation.\\nDiagnostic Unaided Audiologic Evaluation A diagnostic audiogram is required as part of CI can-didacy assessment. Objective assessment of the ear under consideration for CI as well as the contralateral ear is important for managing post-operative expecta-tions for residual hearing,61 determining electrode array selection,62–64 determining the optimal surgical approach,65 consideration for the use of intraoperative tools such as electrocochleography (ECochG),66 and future ampliﬁcation of the implanted or non-implanted ear. Results of the diagnostic audiogram must be used together with the other components of the CI evalua-tion discussed below as part of a holistic candidacy approach (see above) (Fig. 1).\\nConsistent with the Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation, a standard set of mea-sures must be performed and documented for each patient.67 Pre-operative air conduction (AC) pure tone thresholds including 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz are performed via insert earphones for each ear. Bone conduction (BC) pure tone thresholds including 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz are performed for each ear. High frequency AC thresholds (2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) are often in the severe-to-profound range and may not be measurable using standard audiometry.\\nThese are assigned the value of 120 dB for documentation purposes.\\nSigniﬁcant residual low-frequency hearing in either ear (but especially in the ear-to-be-implanted) should not serve as an exclusion for CI candidacy. When low fre-quency thresholds (125, 250, and 500 Hz) are in the normal-to-moderately-severe range, hearing preservation is possible following CI. Electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) using an acoustic component with a CI ear-level sound processor should be considered and discussed if functional hearing preservation is achieved. Functional hearing is deﬁned as hearing in the low frequency thresholds that can be adequately ampliﬁed (i.e., meeting targets on real-ear measurements). Patients using acous-tic plus electric hearing demonstrate improved speech perception outcomes,68 speech understanding in noise,69–72 binaural cues such as summation and squelch,73 sound source localization,70,74 melody recogni-tion and music appreciation,69,75,76 and perceived quality of speech.77 Other objective measures such as tympanometry and acoustic reﬂex thresholds are performed when clinically indicated to screen for the presence of middle ear dysfunc-tion (i.e., middle ear atelectasis, chronic serous otitis, acute otitis media, etc.).78 Although not a contraindica-tion to CI surgery, middle ear dysfunction may delay the implantation process and/or affect the decision regarding which ear to implant.\\nUnaided Speech Recognition Testing As previously discussed, unaided speech recognition testing has historically served as a guide for CI referral.\\nSigniﬁcant variability exists in the testing methodologies (i.e., presentation level, recorded vs. monitored live voice, number of stimuli). Without standardization, the reliabil-ity of using unaided testing to identify CI candidates is diminished and the ability to compare results between practices is mitigated. The recommendation for best prac-tice is to use recorded speech measures. When a patient is non-English-speaking, recommendation for CI evalua-tion may be made based on pure tone audiometry and reported ampliﬁcation beneﬁt.\\nHearing Aid Fitting and Evaluation CI candidacy evaluations must be performed using appropriately ﬁtted and veriﬁed HAs. The term ‘appro-priately ﬁtted and veriﬁed’ refers to the use of real-ear or simulated real-ear measures conducted in a test box or on-ear to conﬁrm the devices meet prescriptive targets for sufﬁcient audibility (i.e., DSL adult, NAL-NL1).79,80 Veriﬁcation can be performed on the patient’s personal hearing instruments or clinic-owned instruments programmed to the patient’s most recent hearing test.81 For CI candidates with underﬁt or poorly ﬁt HAs (e.g., +/\\u0001 >5 dB from the prescriptive targets), the audiol-ogist will make recommendations regarding appropriate adjustments. Functional aided thresholds to determine audibility with the HA(s) can be included but are not essential and should not be the only veriﬁcation method used.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Historically, sentence recognition testing has been the standard for aided speech measures in CI candidacy testing (Table I). However, Sladen and colleagues82 sug-gest sentence recognition scores less reﬂect how well a person can detect and process spectral and temporal com-ponents of speech, and more about how well one can use “top-down processing” to “ﬁll in missing pieces”. Top-down processing can also be altered by cognitive Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 6 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License resources.83,84 Previous studies show that post-lingually deafened adults score much higher on sentence testing than on word testing during CI evaluation.85,86 Previous work demonstrates when monosyllabic word recognition scores are used for CI candidacy qualiﬁ-cation, performance outcomes show signiﬁcant improve-ment from pre- to post-CI. Furthermore, Sladen et al.82 showed a trend for improved performance on CNC word testing when less restrictive criteria (<40% CNC) are used for candidacy qualiﬁcation rather than more restric-tive criteria (<30% CNC).87 Data from Dunn et al.88 dem-onstrate in patients with bilateral deafness who undergo implantation in their worse ear, using a CNC score of ≤50% in the ear to be implanted had a 99.7% sensitivity for identifying candidates who ultimately qualiﬁed based on previous CMS criteria (≤40% sentence recognition testing). Pre to Postoperative CNC word score compari-sons in the implanted ear demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement for those who scored up to 50% preopera-tively. Previous CI clinical trials investigating EAS have used a best-aided CNC score of ≤60% in the ear to be implanted for candidacy inclusion, and a CNC word score of ≤80% in the contralateral ear.72,89–91 These data and those from Sladen et al.82 suggest monosyllabic word recognition testing is more ecological than sentence testing and is as sensitive in predicting CI candidates. Moreover, sentence recognitions tasks are not useful for tracking CI performance outcomes over time due to the large numbers of CI users who achieve ceiling performance early during their post-operative course (60% of users scored >80% by 3 months post-CI). Con-versely, CNC scores improved signiﬁcantly at each of the time periods between surgery and 12-months post-CI with no patients scoring over 80% by the 12-month interval.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Recommendations Aided speech recognition testing should be conducted following recommended clinical guidelines outlined in the Minimum Speech Test Battery27 and Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation67 to ensure standardization across centers. To test, a speaker is situ-ated approximately 39 inches (1 meter) from the ﬂoor and the center of the listener’s head. Best aided speech recog-nition testing is deﬁned as the speech perception score in individual ear(s) using optimized hearing aid(s) on a monosyllabic word test (Consonant-nucleus-consonant, CNC).92 The target presentation level for stimuli is 60 dB A.93 When unaided hearing thresholds are 60 dB HL or better in the non-test ear, either plugging and mufﬁng or masking using speech-shaped noise is per-formed. Any patient who scores ≤50% on CNC in the poorer hearing ear should be considered for CI88 unless contraindicated by hearing history, etiology, or other per-tinent factors gathered during the CI evaluation. The CNC word score in the contralateral ear should not be considered when determining candidacy using this test.\\nImportantly, the clinical trials investigating CI for USNHL did not stipulate the CNC score in the contralateral ear.\\nIt is important to note our recommendation is to use CNC word testing to determine CI candidacy. Because CNC word scores are not used for device labeling or insurance criteria, best aided connected speech testing (best aided deﬁned as speech recognition testing in the individual ear[s] using optimized hearing aid[s]) should be performed using AzBio sentences86 to determine if a patient qualiﬁes for coverage for their CI. To date, no con-sensus exists on the SNR recommended for testing, and varies between clinics.8 Our recommendation is to test the ear to be implanted in the best aided condition using AzBio sentences in noise starting with a + 10 dB SNR using a 10-talker babble (AzBio Sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 55 dB A). To further eval-uate hearing status and to meet insurance qualiﬁcation requirements, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences presented in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (sentences in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as needed (Table II).\\nAlthough clinically signiﬁcant improvements in speech perception in noise can be achieved after implan-tation for patients qualifying for CI in noise conditions listed above, improvements tend to be smaller as SNR becomes more adverse.94,95 Speciﬁcally, persons qualify-ing for CI in only the +5 dB SNR condition can derive sig-niﬁcant beneﬁt from their device, but objective outcomes are more variable.96–98 These data provide useful counsel-ing tools for patients considering CI, but consideration of listening needs and goals should be discussed with each candidate on an individualized basis. Varying the SNR represents real-life listening situations29,96,99 and can be beneﬁcial for determining the SNR at which substantial difﬁculty is noted. Finally, testing AzBio Sentences in the person’s everyday listening condition is recommended for postoperative comparison to the person’s then everyday TABLE II.\\nMinimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB).\\nStimuli Competing Signal Aided Listening Condition Appropriate Speech Recognition Measures Left Right Bilateral Monosyllabic words in quiet (60 dBA) X X Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) Sentences in quiet (60 dBA) X X AzBio Sentences Sentences in noise (65 dBA) Multi-talker speech babble +5 to +10 dB signal to noise ratio X X X AzBio Sentences in Noise; BKB-Sentences in Noise Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 7 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

In addition, numerous authors have published on the relationship between cochlear implantation and cognitive status in patients over the age of 65.103–105 Cognitive evaluations such as the mini mental status exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), tests of verbally based stimuli and responses (i.e., digit span, Stroop), and comparable visu-ally based tests such as the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test have been evaluated. While these tests may be help-ful in assessing CI candidates and in tracking changes in cognition from pre- to post-CI, cognitive testing is not required prior to CI, and there are no recommendations for its inclusion during CI evaluation in this manuscript.\\nCertain considerations must be given to circumstances unique to the aging person. These include possible degen-eration of the central auditory system, declining cognitive status, diminished central receptive or expressive lan-guage function, and coexisting medical, ﬁne motor, and psychosocial disorders. Although none of these issues are absolute contraindications to CI, they should be discussed with the candidate and their support system (friends, family, caregivers) during the evaluation process as they may impact both expectations and outcomes.103,106,107 The medical history should include a thorough medi-cal assessment of the candidate’s comorbidities and car-diovascular health. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kid-ney failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, and coronary artery disease can safely undergo CI surgery. However, communication with the primary care physician or specialist is necessary to obtain surgical clearance and perioperative recommen-dations, which may include conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia.108–110 The evaluation must also include an otologic and neurotologic history and physical examination including microscopic otoscopy including an assessment of current and previous vestibular function.\\nUp to 35% of adults over age 40 have vestibular dysfunc-tion.111,112 Formal vestibular testing prior to CI has been advocated by some to help mitigate the risk of bilateral vestibular hypofunction following CI.113 This practice is not uniformly applied and is not mandatory.114 Further-more, no consensus exists regarding who to test or which test(s) to perform. Pre-operative vestibular testing should therefore be performed at the discretion of the implant team and/or when warranted by the patient’s history.\\nLike vestibular disturbance, the otologic history should also query for the presence of tinnitus. Although some data support the suppression of tinnitus following CI,115,116 the perception of tinnitus can persist following CI and reasonable expectations should be included as part of counseling.\\nImaging There is debate regarding the optimal imaging modality to assess cochlear, middle ear, and mastoid anatomy prior to CI surgery. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have both been used. Although the data suggest preoperative imaging rarely affects surgical decision making,117 imaging ordered in preparation for CI surgery remains at the discretion of the surgeon. Like any diag-nostic tool, cost/beneﬁt analysis and risk assessment must be considered in each case.\\nEar Selection The decision of which ear to implant is nuanced and creating a formulaic approach leading to speciﬁc recom-mendations is not possible. Often the decision is based on objective CI testing, but other factors can contribute such as patient preference, medical evaluation, preoperative imaging, duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, ampliﬁcation history, and audiometric ﬁndings.42,118,119 Although the poorer hearing ear was routinely selected in the past, dogmatic methodology should not take prece-dence in all cases over these other factors.118,120,121 This less rigid approach may lead to a recommendation for implantation of the better hearing ear in some cases when it also meets candidacy. For instance, when the examination indicates signiﬁcant pathology in one ear, implantation of the uninvolved ear (which may be the better hearing ear) is often indicated. However, in cases with an unrevealing history, normal examination and imaging, and symmetric hearing thresholds, the poorer performing ear on CI candidacy testing is routinely selected for CI.\\nVaccinations It is important that the vaccination history of CI can-didates is reviewed by the CI team. The Centers for Dis-ease Control (CDC) recommends all adult CI candidates (≥19 years old) be immunized against pneumococcal men-ingitis. The Task Force recommendation is to follow CDC guidelines prior to (and subsequent to when relevant) cochlear implantation and these guidelines are summa-rized in Table III. Vaccination recommendations may dif-fer between patients based on age, medical history, and/or previous vaccinations. Additional details regarding vaccination recommendations in CI patients can be found on the CDC website.122,123 Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 9 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License COUNSELING AND THERAPY Prior to surgery, the CI team must attempt to under-stand the patient’s goals and expectations as well as those of the caregiver(s) and others involved in the candi-date’s support system. Data suggest a patient’s expecta-tions before CI may inﬂuence their postoperative QoL after surgery, with those who report lower performance expectations showing higher postoperative QoL.124 Importantly, preoperative expectations do not appear to impact post-CI speech recognition scores.125 Although there is no validated measure to assess expectations prior to CI surgery, many CI centers have developed their own pre-operative CI questionnaire that is administered to and discussed with the candidate and their support sys-tem during the evaluation process.\\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing the real-world beneﬁts and improvements in QOL following cochlear implantation have been popularized to complement the objective information gained from speech-centered out-come measures. Examples of these PROMs include Speech, Spatial and Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ),126 and a version of the Cochlear Implant Quality of Life Proﬁle (CIQOL-35 or CIQOL-10).127 The CIQOL-35 has recently been validated and is more psychometrically sound and comprehensive than these other tests for assessing QOL in adult CI users.128 Although preoperative CIQOL-35 scores are not correlated with objective outcomes following CI and are not used for candidacy determination, collecting these data using a standardized instrument will allow large-scale QOL studies in the future. Therefore, the authors suggest the CIQOL-35 be administered pre-operatively and at 3- and 12-months post-CI. CI satisfaction has been shown to corre-late with self-assessed improvements in hearing disability, auditory perception, speech perception, and ease of commu-nication.\\nHowever, satisfaction following CI is not exclusively related to objective determinants and may also be related to positive self-esteem, less severe symptoms of depression, and the use of humor.129 Furthermore, measur-ing subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural reha-bilitation and initiate changes in CI programming to be used in various real-life listening situations.\\nAural Rehabilitation During the CI evaluation process, it is important for the hearing health professional to discuss the importance of post-operative rehabilitation following CI. The candidate’s motivation and support system to participate in rehabilita-tion services following implantation should be assessed. As more is learned about the patient’s goals, an individualized listening therapy plan can be developed and could include referrals to additional specialists (e.g., speech language pathologist). Despite evidence suggesting aural rehabilitation training exercises improve outcomes in CI recipients,130,131 formal aural rehabilitation training programs not often incorporated as part of the follow-up care. Aural rehabilita-tion can occur through the CI clinic, guided by a speech pathologist or audiologist. For centers without these ser-vices, patients can be given the appropriate materials to use at home. For those patients with computer and inter-net access, self-directed computer-based training should be encouraged as research demonstrates that doing so results in improved speech recognition and CI-related QoL.132 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Insurance Coverage It is important to recognize that ‘candidacy’ and ‘coverage’ are not synonymous.

Although National Coverage Determination (NCD) policies published by CMS specify rigid guidelines for unaided audiometric thresholds and aided speech recog-nition testing, it is important to recognize these deﬁni-tions may be more stringent than clinical best practice. In addition, because each state administers its own Medic-aid program, differences exist in CI coverage for adults 21 years and older. As outcomes have improved and can-didacy criteria continue to broaden beyond payer guide-lines, policies and associated determination of candidacy serve to confuse the issue of candidacy versus coverage, which may restrict appropriate education and access.\\nOff-Label Considerations Off-label use of a medical device is the application of the device for a purpose not included as an indication in the FDA-approved device labeling. Clinicians often rec-ommend CI for patients falling outside of FDA-approved criteria when the advantages outweigh the disadvan-tages. Over 75% of CI surgeons in the US self-report that they perform “off-label” CI surgery.10 Off-label implanta-tion requires the clinician be well informed about the product, its use on “ﬁrm scientiﬁc rationale and sound medical evidence”, keep the patient’s best interests at the forefront of the decision-making process, and use best knowledge and judgment.\\nSUMMARY/GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CI CANDIDATES 1. Any patient with hearing loss who gains limited bene-ﬁt from their current HA(s) and desires improvement in hearing should be referred for a CI evaluation.\\nReferrals for borderline candidates, even if the candi-date does not quality, provides an opportunity for counseling and documents a baseline to monitor for future hearing loss progression.\\n2. CI should not be considered a “last resort”. Candi-dates should not wait for “something better”. CI is currently the most effective option for the manage-ment of sensorineural hearing loss not optimally managed by HAs.\\n3. The presence of residual acoustic hearing should not deter referral for CI candidacy evaluation. Residual hearing is not a contraindication for CI surgery, and if maintained following CI can lead to better speech understanding in noise, appreciation of music, and improved sound quality among other beneﬁts. In addition, EAS listening strategies can be implemented post-operatively.\\n4. Ear-speciﬁc CI candidacy must be considered as many studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt of CI in cases of UHL/SSD and AHL.\\n5. A “revised 60/60” criteria can be used as a clinical benchmark for referral for a CI evaluation whereby each ear is considered individually for CI rather than using the better ear as the reference point. If a patient has a PTA ≥60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤60% in the worse hearing ear the patient should be referred for CI evaluation. It should be remembered patients fall-ing outside the “traditional” 60/60 criteria or the “revised” 60/60 criteria may still qualify for CI and should not be excluded from CI evaluation.\\n6. Patient-speciﬁc factors must be considered in identi-fying appropriate CI candidates and can be helpful in counseling prior to surgery. These factors include demographic information, etiology of deafness, dura-tion of hearing loss, HA history, and the candidate’s physical/mental/emotional support system. Although these factors deserve consideration during the evaluation process, they are rarely absolute contrain-dications for surgery.\\n7. CI candidacy testing begins with CNC monosyllabic word testing in each ear using optimized hearing aids. Candidacy is recommended by a score of ≤50% in the ear-to-be implanted, regardless of performance in the contralateral ear. AzBio sentence recognition testing is then performed in the ear to be implanted and used to determine qualiﬁcation for insurance cov-erage. “Best aided” should be interpreted as the score for the ear considered for CI ﬁtted optimized hear-ing aids.\\n8. To determine if a candidate qualiﬁes for insurer’s cov-erage for the CI surgery and device, best aided con-nected speech testing should be performed in the ear to be implanted using AzBio sentences played with a 10-talker babble in +10 dB SNR. To further evaluate hearing status and qualiﬁcation of insurer’s require-ments, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences obtained in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (AzBio in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as appropriate.\\n9. Appropriate recommendations for ﬁtting hearing technology in the contralateral, non-implanted ear, should be discussed to allow for optimization of bin-aural hearing, use of compatible accessories, etc.\\n10. Hearing related disability can be assessed using a variety of QOL instruments. While optional and unrelated to behavioral outcomes post-CI, measuring subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural rehabilitation and initiate changes in CI program-ming based on various real-life listening situations.\\nThe CIQOL-35 is a validated questionnaire speciﬁc to CI patients, and administration is suggested pre-implantation and at 3-months and 12-months post-CI. The CIQOL-35 can be administrated annually thereafter where appropriate to ensure the patient is progressing and meeting stated goals.\\n11. Patients not meeting current FDA labeling and CMS requirements should still be considered for a CI. Evidence-based medicine should guide clinical decision making by the multidisciplinary CI team.\\nConsideration of insurance coverage should be included during counseling as a supplement to clini-cal recommendations but should not be used as deter-rent for referral for a CI evaluation or for CI candidacy.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 11 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 12. Implementation of an aural rehabilitation program must be encouraged as it is essential to maximize outcomes following CI.\\n13. There is no “bad” CI referral. Even if a patient does not initially qualify, the evaluation process can be educational for the patient, can provide a baseline for comparison in the future, and may result in optimiza-tion of HA technology and/or the provision of assistive listening devices.\\nCONCLUSION Untreated and undertreated hearing loss can have negative effects on quality of life. Any patient unable to beneﬁt from, or who perceives dissatisfaction with ampli-ﬁcation should be referred for a formal CI evaluation.\\nCurrently, adult CI candidacy determination involves consideration of both medical and audiological criteria.\\nAppropriate identiﬁcation of CI candidates has been shown to lead to positive outcomes in multiple objective and subjective domains. Given the success of CI technol-ogy as a treatment for disabling hearing loss, it is impera-tive to expand access for all appropriate candidates.\\nThese evidence-based recommendations outline a stan-dardized method for the identiﬁcation of potential CI can-didates, and for the pre- and post-operative evaluation of objective and subjective outcomes.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT DMZ serves on the Surgical Advisory Boards for MED-EL Corporation and Advanced Bionics Corporation, is course director and faculty for Institute for Cochlear Implant Training and is a consultant for Cochlear Corpo-ration.

Prentiss, PhD ; Sarah A. Sydlowski, AuD, PhD, MBA; Camille C. Dunn, PhD, CCC-A The indications for cochlear implantation have expanded over time due to evidence demonstrating identiﬁcation and implanta-tion of appropriate cochlear implant (CI) candidates lead to signiﬁcant improvements in speech recognition and quality of life (QoL). However, clinical practice is variable, with some providers using outdated criteria and others exceeding current labeled indications. As a results, only a fraction of those persons who could beneﬁt from CI technology receive it. This document sum-marizes the current evidence for determining appropriate referrals for adults with bilateral hearing loss into CI centers for for-mal evaluation by stressing the importance of treating each ear individually and a “revised 60/60 rule”. By mirroring contemporary clinical practice and available evidence, these recommendations will also provide a standardized testing protocol for CI candidates using a team-based approach that prioritizes individualized patient care. This manuscript was developed by the Adult Cochlear Implantation Candidacy Task Force of the American Cochlear Implant Alliance using review of the existing literature and clinical consensus.\\nKey Words: adult, candidacy, cochlear implant, evidence, protocol, recommendation.\\nLevel of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 00:1–14, 2023 BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, improvements in cochlear implant (CI) technology, increased awareness of the technology, and changes in candidacy criteria have led to a rapid growth of evidence in the literature regard-ing the beneﬁt of CI in adults. As such, recommendations for CI candidacy and referral continue to evolve. For instance, unlike historical CI recipients with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), CI candi-dates may now have an audiogram that mirrors or over-laps that seen in a hearing aid (HA) candidate and may have hearing in the contralateral ear up to and including normal hearing. Yet, the low utilization of CIs suggests hearing health care providers unfamiliar with current candidacy criteria may be relying on older, stricter criteria for referring potential CI candidates.\\nTo assist in the standardization of practice, CI man-ufacturers have relied upon device labeling from national healthcare governing bodies (i.e., Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). However, labeling has not kept pace with clinical practice. Many commercial payers use FDA labeling to inform their coverage policies, while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a coverage determination policy that dictates payment for CI services. As a result, some patients who may beneﬁt from CI technology yet fall outside of FDA labeling and/or CMS candidacy criteria are prevented from pursuing the technology. The inconsistency among clinical best prac-tice, labeling, and coverage determination policies can create wide variability in practice methods and may lead to the inconsistent provision of CI services on a national, regional, and even a local level. Using established evi-dence, the recommendations summarized in this manu-script will serve to standardize the approach and testing protocol for determining adult candidacy for a CI and highlight the importance of a multi-disciplinary team-based approach for individualized patient care.\\nUNDERUTILIZATION OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION An estimated 466 million persons worldwide live with disabling hearing loss (>6.1% of the world’s popula-tion).\\nOver 40 million people in the United States (US) alone suffer from disabling hearing loss (4.6%).1,2 In persons 12-years-and-older, the prevalence of bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss is estimated to be approx-imately two million1 making hearing loss the third most prevalent chronic health condition in the US.1–3 With the advent of the ﬁrst multi-channel CI system in 1985, guidelines requiring bilateral severe-to-profound SNHL to qualify for CI became the standard of care.

However, as of 2015, 170,252 US adults have been implanted out of an estimated 1,337,144 traditional audiometric CI candidates for a utilization rate of 12.7%.4 Moreover, fewer than 1 million devices have been implanted worldwide.5 The under-penetration of CIs among adult candi-dates is multifactorial and may in part be explained by poor awareness among clinicians and consumers alike.\\nUnfamiliarity with current candidacy criteria, lack of awareness of referral processes and clear referral path-ways to a CI center, and ﬁnancial incentives to sell hear-ing instruments may all contribute.6,7 In addition, hearing healthcare providers currently performing adult CI evaluations demonstrate considerable variability in their testing methodologies and in the deﬁnition of a “good candidate”, leading to inconsistent referrals.8 Last, patients unaware of CI technology, or those unfamiliar with candidacy criteria, may lack the impetus to discuss their options for hearing rehabilitation with their pri-mary care physician, and vice versa. Collectively, these factors likely result in missed opportunities for persons with hearing impairment to be considered for CI.9 As technology has improved and outcomes data have been analyzed, candidacy has gradually expanded to include patients with increasing amounts of residual acoustic hearing and higher aided speech recognition scores (Table I). Evidence now demonstrates FDA device labeling is not always consistent with current clinical practice. An increasing number of patients with hearing loss who fall outside of labeling guidelines are receiving CIs10 and often demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt.11 For example, increasing numbers of patients with asymmetric SNHL (ASNHL) are undergoing CI in their poorer hear-ing ear and demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt in both the implanted ear only condition and when using the CI and the contralateral HA together (bimodal, binaural condition).11–14 In addition, adults with unilateral severe-to-profound SNHL (USNHL) in the poorer ear and thresholds better than or equal to 20 dB HL in the unaf-fected ear (single-sided deafness; SSD) are now undergo-ing CI, and the results have been positive.15–18 Recipients demonstrate improved speech understanding in noise, improved sound source localization, reduction in tinnitus, improved QoL, and increased quality of hearing compared with other available technologies for SSD such as bone conduction implants and contralateral routing of signal HAs.19–24 Furthermore, using a CI in one ear does not alter or decrease performance on the contralateral side, even in cases of normal acoustic hearing.25,26 There have been two versions of a recommended Minimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB)27 and a third is currently in development. Although both versions recom-mend inclusion of a variety of test conditions (ear-speciﬁc and bilaterally aided; sentences in quiet and both ﬁxed and pseudo-adaptive noise, and monosyllabic words), the suggested materials have evolved over time. Speciﬁcally, HINT sentences were replaced by AzBio Sentences28 which were shown to be more ecologically valid.29 How-ever, the MSTB never speciﬁcally suggested how to use the recommended materials to determine CI candidacy.\\nAs the criteria for CI continue to broaden, the materials and methods used to test potential CI candidates remain highly variable and open to interpretation, even for tradi-tional, bilaterally deafened candidates.8 This variability has led to inconsistencies between testing centers making comparison of objective outcomes between patients more difﬁcult and may impair the successful prognostication of postoperative outcomes.30 In addition to objective measures, such as speech recognition scores and severity of hearing loss, determin-ing whether a patient is a CI candidate relies on a cen-ter’s familiarity with outcomes, expanding criteria, and comfort recommending implantation for those outside of FDA indications. Although a few authors have published evidence-based criteria for recommending a CI,31 there is limited guidance regarding how other factors such as cog-nitive ability, willingness to participate in an aural reha-bilitation program, duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation use among others should be used in the can-didacy process.\\nBy developing and implementing standardized rec-ommendations for assessing and conﬁrming CI candidacy, uniformity in testing protocols will be improved, the num-ber of potential CI recipients referred for testing will be increased, and consistency between those considered CI candidates amongst centers will be enhanced. Ultimately this standardization will lead to increased penetration of CI technology to those who could most beneﬁt.\\nMETHODS The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based rec-ommendations for CI candidacy identiﬁcation and referrals based on a comprehensive review of the literature. The recom-mendations encompassed in this article were developed following a predetermined methodological approach which included: (1) determining the need for a set of formal recommendations regarding adult cochlear implant candidacy and navigation of the CI referral pathway by the American Cochlear Implant Alli-ance (ACI Alliance) Board of Directors (BOD); (2) the formation of a team of subject matter experts in the ﬁeld to serve as co-authors and the designation of a lead author; (3) numerous teleconferences to establish the rationale and methodology for development of the recommendations; (4) performing a compre-hensive literature review assisted by medical librarians identify-ing the most up-to-date and state-of-the-art manuscripts on the topics of CI candidacy and referral guidelines; (5) the formation of the recommendations and the creation of an evidence-based pathway as guided by assimilation of the data based on the liter-ature review; (6) a period of review and public comment by the ACI Alliance BOD followed by a unanimous vote of endorsement.\\nThe comprehensive literature review was conducted with the help of medical librarians using a combination of keywords related to cochlear implants from multiple databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Dyna Med, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The articles were reviewed by the authors based on relevance and strength of evidence. The relevant articles were grouped into subtopics (i.e., aided speech recognition testing, can-didacy referral recommendations), and the recommendations were formulated based upon discussion, analysis, and data syn-thesis by all authors.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 3 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Several authors have published parameters to help determine the appropriateness of an adult CI referral and predict the likelihood the candidate will qualify. Gubbels et al. used audiometric ﬁndings to identify patients who are likely to meet CI candidacy fol-lowing formal testing.32 Speciﬁcally, patients with low frequency (250, 500, 1000 Hz) thresholds greater than 75 dB HL and/or a monosyllabic word recognition test score of <40% have a greater than 80% probability of meeting CMS criteria at the time of publication (i.e., <40% sentence recognition score bilaterally in the best-aided condition). When using only a monosyllabic word score <32%, 86% of the patients met CMS criteria.\\nIn patients with private insurance, the accuracy of the model remained strong (>80%) if the monosyllabic word recognition test score was <45%.\\nZwolan et al. performed a similar analysis in which audiometric data were used to predict patients who would qualify for CI under the same CMS criteria.33 When only those patients who met traditional CI indications (i.e., consistent with Medicare coverage guidelines of <40% bilateral sentence recognition score at the time of study publication) were considered, 95% had a preopera-tive pure-tone-average (PTA) in their better hearing ear of 60 dB HL or greater and 92% had an unaided monosyl-labic word score of 60% or lower. When applied retrospec-tively to a large sample of adult CI candidates, this “60/60 guideline” yielded a 96% sensitivity rate (i.e., candidates met both criteria) and a 65% speciﬁcity rate (i.e., non-candidates did not meet the 60/60 criteria).\\nAlthough the Zwolan paper uses a 60/60 guideline in the better hearing ear as a guideline for referral, due to FDA approval for cochlear implantation in cases of asym-metrical hearing loss and single-sided deafness, a “revised 60/60 guideline” is recommended where post-lingually deafened adults are referred for CI evaluations when one or both ears demonstrate a monosyllabic word score that is less than or equal to 60% correct and the unaided PTA (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) is greater than or equal to 60 dB HL. It is important clinicians recognize use of this guideline will only capture the most clear-cut CI candidates and may overlook candidates who still meet FDA criteria with steeply sloping hearing loss.\\nUsing objective audiological data will help hearing health professionals make high-yield and appropriate CI evaluation referrals. However, it is important to recognize that other studies demonstrate a poor correlation between unaided speech recognition scores and eventual CI candidacy.34 Therefore, if a patient demonstrates lim-ited beneﬁt from appropriately ﬁt hearing aids, it is important to consider referral for a formal CI evaluation regardless of the performance on any single test or group of testing measures.\\nIn summary, hearing health professionals should use the revised 60/60 guideline and refer any patient with an unaided PTA of 60 dB HL or greater and an unaided word score of 60% or less in one or both ears for formal CI evaluation. Importantly, those patients falling outside of the revised 60/60 guideline or those falling outside of tra-ditional CI labeling who do not receive adequate beneﬁt from their current technology (i.e., unilateral SNHL, asymmetric SNHL, low frequency thresholds in the nor-mal to mild range) should also be referred for a formal CI evaluation. Although other information will be reviewed by the CI team prior to candidacy determination, using audiometric parameters such as these ensures a greater number of potential CI candidates will undergo consider-ation. If the patient is deemed a non-candidate following formal CI candidacy evaluation, the referring hearing health professional should monitor the patient’s perfor-mance and re-refer with worsening performance or ongo-ing hearing difﬁculties.\\nCOCHLEAR IMPLANT CANDIDACY CONSIDERATIONS The adult CI candidacy evaluation should involve a multi-disciplinary team with experience treating CI patients. Typically, a CI team includes a CI surgeon(s) and audiologist(s) specializing in CI. Based on the com-plexity of the candidate’s case, the pre-, peri-, and/or post-operative needs of the candidate, and/or the customs of a particular CI center, additional team members may include a rehabilitation specialist (auditory-based thera-pist), a neuro-radiologist, psychologists/neuropsycholo-gists, social worker(s), previously implanted peers, and family members/caregivers.\\nIn addition to audiometric thresholds and aided sen-tence recognition in quiet,8,34 other information must be obtained during the hearing health history including ear-speciﬁc aided speech recognition using monosyllabic words and sentences in noise, etiology and duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation, patient’s occupation and/or social hearing needs, demographics (i.e., social support, age, hearing needs such as occupation), decre-ment in hearing speciﬁc and/or overall quality of life (QoL), motivation, and underlying medical factors.\\nAlthough speciﬁc recommendations based on these vari-ables may differ between individual clinics, this holistic approach towards the CI candidate has been shown to be beneﬁcial as part of healthy aging in CI recipi-ents35 (Fig. 1).\\nMultiple hearing health variables have been shown to correlate with CI outcomes including duration of deafness,36–41 HA usage,42 age at implantation,43 and eti-ology of hearing loss.36,39,42 There is evidence that addi-tional demographic variables may also be determinants of Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 4 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License future performance following CI. Tang and colleagues44 showed factors including cohabitation with a spouse or family member(s), familiarity with technology, emotional intelligence, and adherence to postoperative aural reha-bilitation programs can inﬂuence speech outcomes follow-ing CI. Therefore, during the CI evaluation process it is critical to discuss factors such as resources available to the CI candidate and family, a family’s willingness to pro-vide a strong support system, a commitment to post-implantation (re)habilitation, the proximity of the patient to the CI audiologist and/or qualiﬁed (re)habilitation pro-vider, and the willingness and ability of the patient to wear the device.\\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND HEARING NEEDS Although a diagnostic audiogram provides objective information, it does not accurately represent the patient’s functional status as a result of their hearing loss. Speciﬁ-cally, it does not reﬂect the impact the hearing loss has on the patient in their everyday life (i.e., auditory fatigue, cognitive load, etc.) resulting from routine communication disabilities. It is well known that severe-to-profound hearing loss can have signiﬁcant consequences on one’s mental health, social inclusivity, and overall QoL.45 Research demonstrates the advantages CIs have over HAs on the recipient’s QoL in multiple domains including psychosocial health, functional health, and social inclu-sion.46,47 Despite the superiority of CI over HAs in these domains and others, CI penetration in the US has remained stagnant.9 Some evidence even suggests that the duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss prior to CI surgery is increasing, further exacerbating the delete-rious effects on the patient’s QoL.48 Although a CI may not be the optimal approach for every patient who qualiﬁes audiometrically, understanding each person’s hearing needs, communication goals, and QoL detriment are essential in providing additional insight for counsel-ing on realistic expectations. Furthermore, each candi-date must demonstrate a motivation for and commitment to the entire CI process.\\nAUDIOLOGIC EVALUATION Hearing History Obtaining an accurate and comprehensive hearing health history is critical to identifying appropriate CI candidates and understanding factors that may inﬂuence outcomes post-operatively. Information regarding the eti-ology of hearing loss (if known), rate of hearing loss pro-gression (supplemented by prior audiometric testing where available), history of ampliﬁcation, otologic history (i.e., prior operations and/or pathology), and post-implant expectations must be obtained during the clinic evalua-tion. In addition, age at onset of hearing loss and its rela-tionship to language acquisition must be queried as these factors may help predict postoperative outcomes and/or device use compliance.49,50 Speciﬁcally, adult candidates with pre-lingual onset of deafness demonstrate large inter-individual performance variability and levels of sat-isfaction and may be at increased risk for device non-use.51,52 Careful attention to duration of deafness is essential when discussing realistic expectations with the candidate.\\nDuration of deafness can be difﬁcult to accurately assess in some patients. An understanding of the estimated amount of time that the inner ear and auditory cortex has been without meaningful stimulation is critical as it is an important predictor of post-operative objective suc-cess.\\nLack of stimulation may be due to severe-to-profound hearing loss, lack of adequate ampliﬁcation, and/or failure to engage in auditory-rich environments.\\nAs discussed above, longer durations of post-lingual deaf-ness are associated with poorer outcomes after CI.36–41 However, successful outcomes following CI in cases of prolonged durations of deafness (>30 years) have been reported.53 Therefore, duration of deafness in bilaterally deafened adults with a post-lingual onset should not be an absolute contraindication for CI, but rather an impor-tant consideration in setting appropriate post-implantation expectations.\\nIn addition to age of onset and duration of deafness, the duration and consistency of ampliﬁcation use in impaired ears must be determined. Even with consistent ampliﬁcation, long-term severe-to-profound hearing loss can lead to auditory deprivation and may impact out-comes following CI.40,41,54 Critically, the ﬁt and settings of current ampliﬁcation must be veriﬁed by the CI audiol-ogist as many potential CI candidates arrive with inap-propriately ﬁt HAs at the time of the evaluation.8 The etiology of the candidate’s hearing loss should be obtained and documented. CI outcomes can vary widely among recipients based on the etiology of hearing loss and must be reviewed with the patient.55–59 Fig. 1. Factors to consider in an evaluation for a CI candidate.\\n[Color ﬁgure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.laryngoscope.com.] Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 5 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Although very few etiologies of deafness are contraindica-tions to CI surgery, they may impact expected outcomes and must be considered when discussing realistic expec-tations with the patient.\\nDuring the hearing health history, the CI candidate should be asked to share the impact the hearing loss has on their daily life. It is important to understand how the hearing loss impairs or affects the candidate’s ability to work, communicate with friends and family, or interact socially. It is helpful to ask patient-speciﬁc, closed-ended questions that clarify the impact of their hearing loss (i.e., “Can you use a telephone with one or both ears?”, “Can you watch television without subtitles?”, “Can you go out to dinner with friends and keep up with the con-versation?”, “Do you feel your HAs provide sufﬁcient ben-eﬁt?”).\\nMany clinics are using validated screening questionnaires such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Test (HHIE-S)60 to better understand the impact of the candidate’s hearing loss.\\nThis should be repeated post-operatively and shared with the patient by discussing areas of beneﬁt and areas that the patient could beneﬁt from additional rehabilitation.\\nDiagnostic Unaided Audiologic Evaluation A diagnostic audiogram is required as part of CI can-didacy assessment. Objective assessment of the ear under consideration for CI as well as the contralateral ear is important for managing post-operative expecta-tions for residual hearing,61 determining electrode array selection,62–64 determining the optimal surgical approach,65 consideration for the use of intraoperative tools such as electrocochleography (ECochG),66 and future ampliﬁcation of the implanted or non-implanted ear. Results of the diagnostic audiogram must be used together with the other components of the CI evalua-tion discussed below as part of a holistic candidacy approach (see above) (Fig. 1).\\nConsistent with the Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation, a standard set of mea-sures must be performed and documented for each patient.67 Pre-operative air conduction (AC) pure tone thresholds including 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz are performed via insert earphones for each ear. Bone conduction (BC) pure tone thresholds including 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz are performed for each ear. High frequency AC thresholds (2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) are often in the severe-to-profound range and may not be measurable using standard audiometry.\\nThese are assigned the value of 120 dB for documentation purposes.\\nSigniﬁcant residual low-frequency hearing in either ear (but especially in the ear-to-be-implanted) should not serve as an exclusion for CI candidacy. When low fre-quency thresholds (125, 250, and 500 Hz) are in the normal-to-moderately-severe range, hearing preservation is possible following CI. Electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) using an acoustic component with a CI ear-level sound processor should be considered and discussed if functional hearing preservation is achieved. Functional hearing is deﬁned as hearing in the low frequency thresholds that can be adequately ampliﬁed (i.e., meeting targets on real-ear measurements). Patients using acous-tic plus electric hearing demonstrate improved speech perception outcomes,68 speech understanding in noise,69–72 binaural cues such as summation and squelch,73 sound source localization,70,74 melody recogni-tion and music appreciation,69,75,76 and perceived quality of speech.77 Other objective measures such as tympanometry and acoustic reﬂex thresholds are performed when clinically indicated to screen for the presence of middle ear dysfunc-tion (i.e., middle ear atelectasis, chronic serous otitis, acute otitis media, etc.).78 Although not a contraindica-tion to CI surgery, middle ear dysfunction may delay the implantation process and/or affect the decision regarding which ear to implant.\\nUnaided Speech Recognition Testing As previously discussed, unaided speech recognition testing has historically served as a guide for CI referral.\\nSigniﬁcant variability exists in the testing methodologies (i.e., presentation level, recorded vs. monitored live voice, number of stimuli). Without standardization, the reliabil-ity of using unaided testing to identify CI candidates is diminished and the ability to compare results between practices is mitigated. The recommendation for best prac-tice is to use recorded speech measures. When a patient is non-English-speaking, recommendation for CI evalua-tion may be made based on pure tone audiometry and reported ampliﬁcation beneﬁt.\\nHearing Aid Fitting and Evaluation CI candidacy evaluations must be performed using appropriately ﬁtted and veriﬁed HAs. The term ‘appro-priately ﬁtted and veriﬁed’ refers to the use of real-ear or simulated real-ear measures conducted in a test box or on-ear to conﬁrm the devices meet prescriptive targets for sufﬁcient audibility (i.e., DSL adult, NAL-NL1).79,80 Veriﬁcation can be performed on the patient’s personal hearing instruments or clinic-owned instruments programmed to the patient’s most recent hearing test.81 For CI candidates with underﬁt or poorly ﬁt HAs (e.g., +/\\u0001 >5 dB from the prescriptive targets), the audiol-ogist will make recommendations regarding appropriate adjustments. Functional aided thresholds to determine audibility with the HA(s) can be included but are not essential and should not be the only veriﬁcation method used.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Historically, sentence recognition testing has been the standard for aided speech measures in CI candidacy testing (Table I). However, Sladen and colleagues82 sug-gest sentence recognition scores less reﬂect how well a person can detect and process spectral and temporal com-ponents of speech, and more about how well one can use “top-down processing” to “ﬁll in missing pieces”. Top-down processing can also be altered by cognitive Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 6 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License resources.83,84 Previous studies show that post-lingually deafened adults score much higher on sentence testing than on word testing during CI evaluation.85,86 Previous work demonstrates when monosyllabic word recognition scores are used for CI candidacy qualiﬁ-cation, performance outcomes show signiﬁcant improve-ment from pre- to post-CI. Furthermore, Sladen et al.82 showed a trend for improved performance on CNC word testing when less restrictive criteria (<40% CNC) are used for candidacy qualiﬁcation rather than more restric-tive criteria (<30% CNC).87 Data from Dunn et al.88 dem-onstrate in patients with bilateral deafness who undergo implantation in their worse ear, using a CNC score of ≤50% in the ear to be implanted had a 99.7% sensitivity for identifying candidates who ultimately qualiﬁed based on previous CMS criteria (≤40% sentence recognition testing). Pre to Postoperative CNC word score compari-sons in the implanted ear demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement for those who scored up to 50% preopera-tively. Previous CI clinical trials investigating EAS have used a best-aided CNC score of ≤60% in the ear to be implanted for candidacy inclusion, and a CNC word score of ≤80% in the contralateral ear.72,89–91 These data and those from Sladen et al.82 suggest monosyllabic word recognition testing is more ecological than sentence testing and is as sensitive in predicting CI candidates. Moreover, sentence recognitions tasks are not useful for tracking CI performance outcomes over time due to the large numbers of CI users who achieve ceiling performance early during their post-operative course (60% of users scored >80% by 3 months post-CI). Con-versely, CNC scores improved signiﬁcantly at each of the time periods between surgery and 12-months post-CI with no patients scoring over 80% by the 12-month interval.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Recommendations Aided speech recognition testing should be conducted following recommended clinical guidelines outlined in the Minimum Speech Test Battery27 and Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation67 to ensure standardization across centers. To test, a speaker is situ-ated approximately 39 inches (1 meter) from the ﬂoor and the center of the listener’s head. Best aided speech recog-nition testing is deﬁned as the speech perception score in individual ear(s) using optimized hearing aid(s) on a monosyllabic word test (Consonant-nucleus-consonant, CNC).92 The target presentation level for stimuli is 60 dB A.93 When unaided hearing thresholds are 60 dB HL or better in the non-test ear, either plugging and mufﬁng or masking using speech-shaped noise is per-formed. Any patient who scores ≤50% on CNC in the poorer hearing ear should be considered for CI88 unless contraindicated by hearing history, etiology, or other per-tinent factors gathered during the CI evaluation. The CNC word score in the contralateral ear should not be considered when determining candidacy using this test.\\nImportantly, the clinical trials investigating CI for USNHL did not stipulate the CNC score in the contralateral ear.\\nIt is important to note our recommendation is to use CNC word testing to determine CI candidacy. Because CNC word scores are not used for device labeling or insurance criteria, best aided connected speech testing (best aided deﬁned as speech recognition testing in the individual ear[s] using optimized hearing aid[s]) should be performed using AzBio sentences86 to determine if a patient qualiﬁes for coverage for their CI. To date, no con-sensus exists on the SNR recommended for testing, and varies between clinics.8 Our recommendation is to test the ear to be implanted in the best aided condition using AzBio sentences in noise starting with a + 10 dB SNR using a 10-talker babble (AzBio Sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 55 dB A). To further eval-uate hearing status and to meet insurance qualiﬁcation requirements, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences presented in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (sentences in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as needed (Table II).\\nAlthough clinically signiﬁcant improvements in speech perception in noise can be achieved after implan-tation for patients qualifying for CI in noise conditions listed above, improvements tend to be smaller as SNR becomes more adverse.94,95 Speciﬁcally, persons qualify-ing for CI in only the +5 dB SNR condition can derive sig-niﬁcant beneﬁt from their device, but objective outcomes are more variable.96–98 These data provide useful counsel-ing tools for patients considering CI, but consideration of listening needs and goals should be discussed with each candidate on an individualized basis. Varying the SNR represents real-life listening situations29,96,99 and can be beneﬁcial for determining the SNR at which substantial difﬁculty is noted. Finally, testing AzBio Sentences in the person’s everyday listening condition is recommended for postoperative comparison to the person’s then everyday TABLE II.\\nMinimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB).\\nStimuli Competing Signal Aided Listening Condition Appropriate Speech Recognition Measures Left Right Bilateral Monosyllabic words in quiet (60 dBA) X X Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) Sentences in quiet (60 dBA) X X AzBio Sentences Sentences in noise (65 dBA) Multi-talker speech babble +5 to +10 dB signal to noise ratio X X X AzBio Sentences in Noise; BKB-Sentences in Noise Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 7 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

In addition, numerous authors have published on the relationship between cochlear implantation and cognitive status in patients over the age of 65.103–105 Cognitive evaluations such as the mini mental status exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), tests of verbally based stimuli and responses (i.e., digit span, Stroop), and comparable visu-ally based tests such as the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test have been evaluated. While these tests may be help-ful in assessing CI candidates and in tracking changes in cognition from pre- to post-CI, cognitive testing is not required prior to CI, and there are no recommendations for its inclusion during CI evaluation in this manuscript.\\nCertain considerations must be given to circumstances unique to the aging person. These include possible degen-eration of the central auditory system, declining cognitive status, diminished central receptive or expressive lan-guage function, and coexisting medical, ﬁne motor, and psychosocial disorders. Although none of these issues are absolute contraindications to CI, they should be discussed with the candidate and their support system (friends, family, caregivers) during the evaluation process as they may impact both expectations and outcomes.103,106,107 The medical history should include a thorough medi-cal assessment of the candidate’s comorbidities and car-diovascular health. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kid-ney failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, and coronary artery disease can safely undergo CI surgery. However, communication with the primary care physician or specialist is necessary to obtain surgical clearance and perioperative recommen-dations, which may include conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia.108–110 The evaluation must also include an otologic and neurotologic history and physical examination including microscopic otoscopy including an assessment of current and previous vestibular function.\\nUp to 35% of adults over age 40 have vestibular dysfunc-tion.111,112 Formal vestibular testing prior to CI has been advocated by some to help mitigate the risk of bilateral vestibular hypofunction following CI.113 This practice is not uniformly applied and is not mandatory.114 Further-more, no consensus exists regarding who to test or which test(s) to perform. Pre-operative vestibular testing should therefore be performed at the discretion of the implant team and/or when warranted by the patient’s history.\\nLike vestibular disturbance, the otologic history should also query for the presence of tinnitus. Although some data support the suppression of tinnitus following CI,115,116 the perception of tinnitus can persist following CI and reasonable expectations should be included as part of counseling.\\nImaging There is debate regarding the optimal imaging modality to assess cochlear, middle ear, and mastoid anatomy prior to CI surgery. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have both been used. Although the data suggest preoperative imaging rarely affects surgical decision making,117 imaging ordered in preparation for CI surgery remains at the discretion of the surgeon. Like any diag-nostic tool, cost/beneﬁt analysis and risk assessment must be considered in each case.\\nEar Selection The decision of which ear to implant is nuanced and creating a formulaic approach leading to speciﬁc recom-mendations is not possible. Often the decision is based on objective CI testing, but other factors can contribute such as patient preference, medical evaluation, preoperative imaging, duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, ampliﬁcation history, and audiometric ﬁndings.42,118,119 Although the poorer hearing ear was routinely selected in the past, dogmatic methodology should not take prece-dence in all cases over these other factors.118,120,121 This less rigid approach may lead to a recommendation for implantation of the better hearing ear in some cases when it also meets candidacy. For instance, when the examination indicates signiﬁcant pathology in one ear, implantation of the uninvolved ear (which may be the better hearing ear) is often indicated. However, in cases with an unrevealing history, normal examination and imaging, and symmetric hearing thresholds, the poorer performing ear on CI candidacy testing is routinely selected for CI.\\nVaccinations It is important that the vaccination history of CI can-didates is reviewed by the CI team. The Centers for Dis-ease Control (CDC) recommends all adult CI candidates (≥19 years old) be immunized against pneumococcal men-ingitis. The Task Force recommendation is to follow CDC guidelines prior to (and subsequent to when relevant) cochlear implantation and these guidelines are summa-rized in Table III. Vaccination recommendations may dif-fer between patients based on age, medical history, and/or previous vaccinations. Additional details regarding vaccination recommendations in CI patients can be found on the CDC website.122,123 Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 9 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License COUNSELING AND THERAPY Prior to surgery, the CI team must attempt to under-stand the patient’s goals and expectations as well as those of the caregiver(s) and others involved in the candi-date’s support system. Data suggest a patient’s expecta-tions before CI may inﬂuence their postoperative QoL after surgery, with those who report lower performance expectations showing higher postoperative QoL.124 Importantly, preoperative expectations do not appear to impact post-CI speech recognition scores.125 Although there is no validated measure to assess expectations prior to CI surgery, many CI centers have developed their own pre-operative CI questionnaire that is administered to and discussed with the candidate and their support sys-tem during the evaluation process.\\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing the real-world beneﬁts and improvements in QOL following cochlear implantation have been popularized to complement the objective information gained from speech-centered out-come measures. Examples of these PROMs include Speech, Spatial and Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ),126 and a version of the Cochlear Implant Quality of Life Proﬁle (CIQOL-35 or CIQOL-10).127 The CIQOL-35 has recently been validated and is more psychometrically sound and comprehensive than these other tests for assessing QOL in adult CI users.128 Although preoperative CIQOL-35 scores are not correlated with objective outcomes following CI and are not used for candidacy determination, collecting these data using a standardized instrument will allow large-scale QOL studies in the future. Therefore, the authors suggest the CIQOL-35 be administered pre-operatively and at 3- and 12-months post-CI. CI satisfaction has been shown to corre-late with self-assessed improvements in hearing disability, auditory perception, speech perception, and ease of commu-nication.\\nHowever, satisfaction following CI is not exclusively related to objective determinants and may also be related to positive self-esteem, less severe symptoms of depression, and the use of humor.129 Furthermore, measur-ing subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural reha-bilitation and initiate changes in CI programming to be used in various real-life listening situations.\\nAural Rehabilitation During the CI evaluation process, it is important for the hearing health professional to discuss the importance of post-operative rehabilitation following CI. The candidate’s motivation and support system to participate in rehabilita-tion services following implantation should be assessed. As more is learned about the patient’s goals, an individualized listening therapy plan can be developed and could include referrals to additional specialists (e.g., speech language pathologist). Despite evidence suggesting aural rehabilitation training exercises improve outcomes in CI recipients,130,131 formal aural rehabilitation training programs not often incorporated as part of the follow-up care. Aural rehabilita-tion can occur through the CI clinic, guided by a speech pathologist or audiologist. For centers without these ser-vices, patients can be given the appropriate materials to use at home. For those patients with computer and inter-net access, self-directed computer-based training should be encouraged as research demonstrates that doing so results in improved speech recognition and CI-related QoL.132 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Insurance Coverage It is important to recognize that ‘candidacy’ and ‘coverage’ are not synonymous.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License clinical best practice dictates many candidates fall out-side of FDA-labeled indications and CMS coverage poli-cies. Although National Coverage Determination (NCD) policies published by CMS specify rigid guidelines for unaided audiometric thresholds and aided speech recog-nition testing, it is important to recognize these deﬁni-tions may be more stringent than clinical best practice. In addition, because each state administers its own Medic-aid program, differences exist in CI coverage for adults 21 years and older. As outcomes have improved and can-didacy criteria continue to broaden beyond payer guide-lines, policies and associated determination of candidacy serve to confuse the issue of candidacy versus coverage, which may restrict appropriate education and access.\\nOff-Label Considerations Off-label use of a medical device is the application of the device for a purpose not included as an indication in the FDA-approved device labeling. Clinicians often rec-ommend CI for patients falling outside of FDA-approved criteria when the advantages outweigh the disadvan-tages. Over 75% of CI surgeons in the US self-report that they perform “off-label” CI surgery.10 Off-label implanta-tion requires the clinician be well informed about the product, its use on “ﬁrm scientiﬁc rationale and sound medical evidence”, keep the patient’s best interests at the forefront of the decision-making process, and use best knowledge and judgment.\\nSUMMARY/GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CI CANDIDATES 1. Any patient with hearing loss who gains limited bene-ﬁt from their current HA(s) and desires improvement in hearing should be referred for a CI evaluation.\\nReferrals for borderline candidates, even if the candi-date does not quality, provides an opportunity for counseling and documents a baseline to monitor for future hearing loss progression.\\n2. CI should not be considered a “last resort”. Candi-dates should not wait for “something better”. CI is currently the most effective option for the manage-ment of sensorineural hearing loss not optimally managed by HAs.\\n3. The presence of residual acoustic hearing should not deter referral for CI candidacy evaluation. Residual hearing is not a contraindication for CI surgery, and if maintained following CI can lead to better speech understanding in noise, appreciation of music, and improved sound quality among other beneﬁts. In addition, EAS listening strategies can be implemented post-operatively.\\n4. Ear-speciﬁc CI candidacy must be considered as many studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt of CI in cases of UHL/SSD and AHL.\\n5. A “revised 60/60” criteria can be used as a clinical benchmark for referral for a CI evaluation whereby each ear is considered individually for CI rather than using the better ear as the reference point. If a patient has a PTA ≥60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤60% in the worse hearing ear the patient should be referred for CI evaluation. It should be remembered patients fall-ing outside the “traditional” 60/60 criteria or the “revised” 60/60 criteria may still qualify for CI and should not be excluded from CI evaluation.\\n6. Patient-speciﬁc factors must be considered in identi-fying appropriate CI candidates and can be helpful in counseling prior to surgery. These factors include demographic information, etiology of deafness, dura-tion of hearing loss, HA history, and the candidate’s physical/mental/emotional support system. Although these factors deserve consideration during the evaluation process, they are rarely absolute contrain-dications for surgery.\\n7. CI candidacy testing begins with CNC monosyllabic word testing in each ear using optimized hearing aids. Candidacy is recommended by a score of ≤50% in the ear-to-be implanted, regardless of performance in the contralateral ear. AzBio sentence recognition testing is then performed in the ear to be implanted and used to determine qualiﬁcation for insurance cov-erage. “Best aided” should be interpreted as the score for the ear considered for CI ﬁtted optimized hear-ing aids.\\n8. To determine if a candidate qualiﬁes for insurer’s cov-erage for the CI surgery and device, best aided con-nected speech testing should be performed in the ear to be implanted using AzBio sentences played with a 10-talker babble in +10 dB SNR. To further evaluate hearing status and qualiﬁcation of insurer’s require-ments, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences obtained in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (AzBio in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as appropriate.\\n9. Appropriate recommendations for ﬁtting hearing technology in the contralateral, non-implanted ear, should be discussed to allow for optimization of bin-aural hearing, use of compatible accessories, etc.\\n10. Hearing related disability can be assessed using a variety of QOL instruments. While optional and unrelated to behavioral outcomes post-CI, measuring subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural rehabilitation and initiate changes in CI program-ming based on various real-life listening situations.\\nThe CIQOL-35 is a validated questionnaire speciﬁc to CI patients, and administration is suggested pre-implantation and at 3-months and 12-months post-CI. The CIQOL-35 can be administrated annually thereafter where appropriate to ensure the patient is progressing and meeting stated goals.\\n11. Patients not meeting current FDA labeling and CMS requirements should still be considered for a CI. Evidence-based medicine should guide clinical decision making by the multidisciplinary CI team.\\nConsideration of insurance coverage should be included during counseling as a supplement to clini-cal recommendations but should not be used as deter-rent for referral for a CI evaluation or for CI candidacy.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 11 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 12. Implementation of an aural rehabilitation program must be encouraged as it is essential to maximize outcomes following CI.\\n13. There is no “bad” CI referral. Even if a patient does not initially qualify, the evaluation process can be educational for the patient, can provide a baseline for comparison in the future, and may result in optimiza-tion of HA technology and/or the provision of assistive listening devices.\\nCONCLUSION Untreated and undertreated hearing loss can have negative effects on quality of life. Any patient unable to beneﬁt from, or who perceives dissatisfaction with ampli-ﬁcation should be referred for a formal CI evaluation.\\nCurrently, adult CI candidacy determination involves consideration of both medical and audiological criteria.\\nAppropriate identiﬁcation of CI candidates has been shown to lead to positive outcomes in multiple objective and subjective domains. Given the success of CI technol-ogy as a treatment for disabling hearing loss, it is impera-tive to expand access for all appropriate candidates.\\nThese evidence-based recommendations outline a stan-dardized method for the identiﬁcation of potential CI can-didates, and for the pre- and post-operative evaluation of objective and subjective outcomes.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT DMZ serves on the Surgical Advisory Boards for MED-EL Corporation and Advanced Bionics Corporation, is course director and faculty for Institute for Cochlear Implant Training and is a consultant for Cochlear Corpo-ration.

Secondary cholesteatomas may develop as a result of cochlear implant surgery. Primarily acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss or cochlear implant in children. The occurrence of congenital cholesteatoma during cochlear implant surgery has never been reported before, partly because all patients are preoperatively submitted to imaging studies which can theoretically exclude the disease.\\n\\n### Case presentation\\n\\nWe have reported a rare case of congenital cholesteatoma, found during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child. The child underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months of age, before the first cochlear implant surgery, which excluded middle ear pathology. The mass was removed as an intact pearl, without visible or microscopic violation of the cholesteatoma capsule. All the areas where middle ear structures were touching the cholesteatoma were vaporized with a laser and the cochlear implant was inserted uneventfully. Further follow-up excluded residual disease.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWe believe that primary, single stage placement of a cochlear implant (CI) with simultaneous removal of the congenital cholesteatoma can be performed safely. However, to prevent recurrence, the capsule of the cholesteatoma must not be damaged and complete laser ablation of the surface, where suspicious epithelial cells could remain, is recommended. In our opinion, cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation should be staged if these conditions are not met, and/or the disease is at a more advanced stage. It is suspected, that the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in pediatric CI candidates is much higher that in average pediatric population.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Congenital cholesteatoma, Cochlear implantation, Cochlear implant candidacy, Laser surgery\\n\\nBackground\\n----------\\n\\nCholesteatoma is an uncommon condition that has been rarely associated with cochlear implantation. Primary acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or CI in children. In case of secondary acquired cholesteatomas – they can develop as the result of cochlear implant surgery due to a breach of the posterior wall of the ear canal from drilling the posterior tympanotomy [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR1)]. The identification of congenital cholesteatoma during CI surgery is unlikely because of thorough pre-operative imaging studies, most commonly involving high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and MRI of the temporal bone, which can theoretically exclude congenital cholesteatoma. The incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in the overall population is 0.00012% and 1–3% of childhood cholesteatomas are congenital [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR3)]. Chung et al. reported that congenital cholesteatoma was identified in 2 out of 794 pediatric CI patients during their pre-operative evaluations for CI (incidence, 0.25%) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. The authors suggest that the incidence was much higher than expected of this rare condition.\\n\\nCongenital cholesteatoma was initially described by Cawthorne and Griffith [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR5)]. In 1965, Derlacki and Clemis defined congenital cholesteatoma as an embryologic residue of epithelial tissue behind a normal tympanic membrane in the absence of a history of infection or ear surgery [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)]. Levenson added that the presence of uncomplicated acute otitis media does not exclude congenital cholesteatoma [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR7)].\\n\\nCongenital cholesteatoma usually grows slowly as a spherical-shaped keratin-filled cyst in the middle ear with a long asymptomatic period. When early detected, they are located deep to the antero-superior part of the tympanic membrane in two-thirds of the cases. The diagnosis is made at an average age of 4.5 years with a male to female ratio of 1:3. There are two types of congenital cholesteatoma, defined according to their location in the middle ear. The first is an isolated pearl located deep to the anterior part of the eardrum, which is believed to result from arrested epidermal formation at 10 weeks’ gestational age. It is suggested that these formations atrophy at approximately 33 weeks of gestational age, or are evacuated through the Eustachian tube. Failure of this mechanism results in this type of congenital cholesteatoma [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR8)]. The second type is located in the posterior part of the middle ear and causes more rapid ossicular destruction and hearing impairment. The origin of this type is thought to be amniotic fluid cells that migrate in the neonate [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR9)]. The theory of congenital cholesteatoma origin assumes that the pathology is present before birth and the diagnosis is most often made by a combination of otoscopy and HRCT. In a completely aerated tympanic cavity absent of any associated soft tissue, HRCT has a high negative predictive value when excluding cholesteatoma [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR10)]. Microsurgical excision is the accepted treatment and associated laser vaporization of contact points has been shown to limit the rate of recurrence [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR11)]. We present a case of congenital cholesteatoma found this time not during diagnostic procedure before CI, but during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child in spite of prior imaging studies.\\n\\nCase presentation\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe patient was a female child diagnosed with bilateral SNHL of genetic origin at the age of 8 months. Genetic testing identified a deletion - 35delG in gene GJB2. The patient failed the newborn hearing screen at birth with subsequent diagnostic auditory brainstem responses demonstrating bilateral, severe to profound SNHL. The child initially received hearing aids but presented significant speech delay despite conventional amplification. Referred for consideration for CI, the patient underwent thorough diagnostic testing by a multidisciplinary team as well as imaging evaluation with HRCT and MRI. HRCT of the temporal bones was performed with a standard protocol using a bone algorithm with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm and collimation of 0.3 mm.\\n\\nPreoperative 1.5 Tesla MRI (Fig.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig1)) and HRCT (Fig.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig2)) studies showed implantable inner ear spaces, present cochlear nerves, and no suggestion of additional middle ear pathology. A decision was made to implant the right ear and surgery was performed when the child reached 1 year of age. The surgery on this side was uneventful and without complications or findings of associated middle ear diseases. At the same time, the left ear was equipped with an updated hearing aid. The Integration Scale of Development was used to assess the development of hearing and speech, which is our routine protocol for children between 1 and 4 years of age. The results showed that the child achieved excellent speech and language outcomes comparable to age-appropriate normal hearing subjects. The patient was subsequently evaluated for sequential implantation of the left ear, showing unremarkable otoscopy and a normal tympanic membrane. Normal appearance of the tympanic membrane was also confirmed during otomicroscopy intraoperatively at the time of the second CI surgery. The second implantation was performed two years after the first CI surgery when the child was 3 years old. In our clinic, in cases of sequential implantation, we do not routinely re-image the temporal bones if the first examination showed no pathology. The second CI surgery was performed as per our routine protocol using a posterior tympanotomy approach to the round window and promontory. After opening the facial recess, an approximately 3-mm pearl-appearing cholesteatoma was identified between the facial ridge, incudostapedial joint, and cochleariform process (Fig.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig3)). To remove the pathology en bloc, the ossicles were disarticulated and the cholesteatoma was removed together with the incus. All tissues contacting the cholesteatoma were vaporized superficially with a diode laser at a setting of 2 W with single short pulses of 0.05 s (Fig.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig4)) delivered through a 0.6-mm fiber. In surgery for isolated cholesteatoma pearls, we routinely use a laser to minimize the risk of recurrence. The CI was then inserted uneventfully through an extended round window approach.\\n\\n### Fig. 1.\\n\\n![Image 9: Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/aba3/4736255/f29ad2ca6995/40463_2016_119_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/figure/Fig1/)\\n\\nMRI T2-weighted axial image of the ear before the first CI surgery at 1 year of age showing no middle ear pathology\\n\\n### Fig. 2.\\n\\n![Image 10: Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/aba3/4736255/434e9ae0d3d9/40463_2016_119_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/figure/Fig2/)\\n\\nHRCT image (axial-left and coronal-right) of the left temporal bone before the first CI surgery at 1 year of age showing no middle ear pathology\\n\\n### Fig. 3.\\n\\n![Image 11: Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/aba3/4736255/4affe4d46d2f/40463_2016_119_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/figure/Fig3/)\\n\\nCholesteatoma, microscopic view\\n\\n### Fig. 4.\\n\\n![Image 12: Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/aba3/4736255/55af61f59a2f/40463_2016_119_Fig4_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/figure/Fig4/)\\n\\nDiode laser treatment of the operated field, microscopic view\\n\\nOne year after, a CT of the temporal bone was performed to exclude residual disease and suspicious opacification in the facial recess area was revealed. The residual disease was excluded by the endoscopy of the middle ear through anterior tympanotomy approach. The opacification turned out to be connective tissue used for obliteration of posterior tympanotomy during the CI surgery.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n----------\\n\\nImaging before cochlear implantation is used to confirm the presence of an implantable inner ear space and intact cochlear nerve, as well as to provide important information about the surgical anatomy of the ear [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR12)]. Both MRI and HRCT can potentially diagnose a pathologic mass such as cholesteatoma in the middle ear space. HRCT has excellent sub-millimeter spatial resolution, which provides accurate delineation of even very small cholesteatomas, as long as there is a well-aerated middle ear cavity. HRCT in this setting offers high sensitivity and excellent negative predictive value [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR13)]. In our case, the conditions for evaluation of the middle ear were excellent. The middle ear was completely free of effusion (Fig.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig2)), however HRCT has poor specificity because the nature of the soft tissue density cannot be differentiated.\\n\\nMRI using the conventional sequences (T1-weighted image, T2-weighted image, post-contrast T1-weighted image) provides additional information enabling distinguishment of different pathologic entities, as well as accurate diagnosis of primary and residual/recurrent cholesteatomas. Even higher diagnostic specificity is achieved with diffusion-weighted (DW) echo-planar imaging, delayed post-contrast imaging, DW-non-echo-planar imaging, and DWI-PROPELLER techniques. We used a 1.5 Tesla MRI with conventional sequences in our patient, following our routine protocol, which was focused primarily on assessing the anatomical implant feasibility in young children. However, even with conventional protocols, a pathological mass greater than 2 mm in size and surrounded by air can be identified on the T2-weighted sequence. In conventional MRI, the diagnosis of sub-millimeter anatomical structures is also possible provided that there is good signal contrast between the structure and its surroundings, as in our case. For temporal bone diagnosis in clinical practice, we use a 1.5 Tesla MRI. With the development of new models, MRI at 3 Tesla or higher is becoming more common and widely available. The main advantage is shorter acquisition time but because of artifacts specific to this anatomic region, diffusion-weighted sequence acquisition is paradoxically longer, which increases the risk of motion artifacts, especially in children, making interpretation more difficult, even for experienced radiologists [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR14)].\\n\\nExcept for paper of Chung et al., to date, there has been no literature published on the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma found prior to implantation [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. The authors found this incidence (0,25%) much higher than expected of this rare condition in general population (0.00012%). It is surprisingly common, given the absence of any cases of primarily acquired cholesteatoma in the reported group of patients, which is considerably more common in the pediatric population. Our case, as well as both reported by Chung et al. of congenital cholesteatoma patients, most likely had an inherited form of hearing loss and, as they suggested, genetic contribution to the presence of congenital cholesteatoma cannot be excluded [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. A correlation between the formation of congenital cholesteatoma and abnormal cochleovestibular anatomy and SNHL have also been reported by Propst et al. and Jackler et al. [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR15), [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR16)].\\n\\nIt has been suggested that if congenital cholesteatoma is found during diagnostic procedures for CI, the cholesteatoma should be removed and implantation delayed to the second stage [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. In our patient, we made the decision to remove the cholesteatoma and insert an implant in a one-stage procedure because the disease was removed as an intact pearl, without visible or microscopic violation of the cholesteatoma capsule, and the areas of contact between the cholesteatoma and middle ear structures were vaporized with a laser. The risk of recurrence was very unlikely. Such a protocol has been used in our clinic for several years in numerous ear operations, in cases of limited congenital cholesteatoma and small cholesteatoma pearls found during second-look procedures. We consider the procedure safe and do not hesitate to proceed with ossicular reconstruction in such cases. What is more, revision surgery is also not planned in such situations.\\n\\nAlthough the laser is not universally utilized in the treatment of cholesteatoma, Hamilton concludes that the appropriate use of the laser during cholesteatoma surgery facilitates significantly the complete removal of the disease and presents no extra risk to the vital structures within the temporal bone [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR11)]. Also James et al. stated that current technological advances such as laser and middle ear endoscopy contribute to better outcomes in the treatment of cholesteatoma [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR17)]. As it has been mentioned we routinely use laser during cholesteatoma surgery in our clinic.\\n\\nIt has long been recognized that a second-look procedure in cases of congenital cholesteatoma is required less often than in acquired pediatric cholesteatoma [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR18)]. James et al. suggested that when the cholesteatoma cyst is removed intact, complete eradication can be almost guaranteed, and recommended a second-look procedure when cholesteatoma extends into hidden regions such as the mastoid, or with concerns about the completeness of matrix removal [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR17)]. We also follow this strategy. In our case, the cholesteatoma did not extend into hidden spaces; it was a closed capsule and we had no concerns about incomplete removal. It should be emphasized that the decision to proceed with CI requires careful consideration on a case-by-case basis. Particularly with a larger congenital cholesteatoma, a damaged capsule, or widespread pathology, delaying CI is the most reasonable and safest option [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)].\\n\\nAccording to Derlacki and Clemis’ criteria the patient’s cholesteatoma met the definition of a congenital cholesteatoma - it was totally asymptomatic and behind an intact tympanic membrane [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)]. Cholesteatoma was not seen at otoscopy before the first and second surgery. Before the first surgery it was most probably so small that it was not within the limits of visibility even for CT and MRI. The cholesteatoma was not seen at otoscopy at the second surgery either because it was located medially to the long crus of the incus and the handle of the malleus. Middle ear pathology located in the posterior mesotympanum is practically invisible until it touches the tympanic membrane and can be easily overlooked.\\n\\nThe growth rate of this particular cholesteatoma had to be relatively dynamic.\\n\\nThe original size of the cholesteatoma is important. According to the first theory of origination of congenital cholesteatoma, the diameter of the epidermoid formations frequently found in human fetuses that proceed to congenital cholesteatoma if not absorbed or evacuated through the Eustachian tube, is already known. Huang et al. reviewed 49 fetuses, ranging from 12 weeks to full term. In 16 they found epidermoid formation, which was always located at the anterosuperior edge of the eardrum [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR19)]. The width and height of the epidermoid formations was 60.82 ± 5.68 microns and 45.87 ± 6.82 microns, respectively. In our case, the cholesteatoma was located in the posterior mesotympanum, and met the second theory of origination, which says that amniotic fluid cells migrate through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and then form the cholesteatoma. In this case, the cholesteatoma might have arisen from a single cell, or group of cells, also microns in diameter.\\n\\nAssuming a linear growth for congenital cholesteatoma, James et al. calculated that closed cholesteatoma cysts enlarge by approximately 1 mm in diameter per year, based on CT measurements ([[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR20)] James). We can assume in our case that the growth was linear because it was a closed round capsule; therefore, in the first year of life, theoretically, the cholesteatoma would have been approximately 1 mm in diameter, enlarging to approximately 3 mm in diameter at 3 years of age. A 1-mm pearl would be visible by imaging studies and the negative predictive value of CT in such a case is excellent [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)].\\n\\nThe explanation for the lack of identification of the cholesteatoma on the initial HRCT is that the pathology was too small to be visualized. The most likely it was a very small sub-millimeter “sleeper” congenital cholesteatoma with no growth between birth and the first year, but with subsequent rapid growth between 1 and 3 years of life.\\n\\nBilateral cochlear implantation in young children is increasingly common in clinical practice. Among the benefits of bilateral cochlear implantation is the restoration of some of the advantages of binaural hearing such as localization, improved listening in noise, directional hearing, binaural summation, and squelch. Typically, young hearing-impaired children are being provided with two implants either at the same time (simultaneous implantation) or at different times in early childhood as in our case (sequential implantation) [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR21)]. Our local public funding policy enables children to receive initially unilateral cochlear implant due to economic limitations. In our clinic, excluding the post meningitis deafness, when bilateral implants are put simultaneously, the CI candidates are implanted unilaterally as quickly as possible, starting from the age of 12 months. Only when we are able to provide all candidates with one implant and meet the economic limitations, do we consider giving another implant to prior pediatric CI users.\\n\\nExamining the findings in this patient, the obvious question arises whether to perform another imaging study which could preclude the existing, newly formed cholesteatoma before the subsequent CI surgery, and how much time should elapse between the first and second implantation, to perform such a study most effectively?\\n\\nWe believe that the rarity of our particular case does not justify the additional cost and burden of repeating the standard HRCT and/or MRI in so young children. Also, our case presented with limited pathology that was controlled by a single-stage procedure. We emphasize the importance of continued follow-up and advise considering staging in either known disease or more extensive disease as a reasonable and safe option.\\n\\nConclusions\\n-----------\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of an incidental finding of congenital cholesteatoma during CI surgery despite presurgical imaging studies. Primary excision en bloc with the removal of associated ossicular elements and laser surface ablation is the recommended treatment for limited congenital cholesteatoma. Primary placement of an implant during cholesteatoma removal is warranted as long as there is insignificant risk of recurrence, provided that no damage of the capsule has occurred and complete and safe surface contact of epithelial laser ablation was observed. There should be a low threshold for staging the implant if any of these conditions are not met, and/or the disease is found to be more extensive. Follow-up should include regular microscopic ear examination and HRCT.\\n\\nThere is suspicion that the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in pediatric CI candidates is much higher than in normal pediatric population (4).\\n\\n### Consent\\n\\nThe written consent was obtained from the patient’s parents to publish the details of their child’s case.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n----------------\\n\\nWe thank language editor Kumiko Shimogami from Edanz Group Global Ltd who has made significant revision of the manuscript.

Secondary cholesteatomas may develop as a result of cochlear implant surgery. Primarily acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss or cochlear implant in children. The occurrence of congenital cholesteatoma during cochlear implant surgery has never been reported before, partly because all patients are preoperatively submitted to imaging studies which can theoretically exclude the disease.\\n\\n### Case presentation\\n\\nWe have reported a rare case of congenital cholesteatoma, found during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child. The child underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12\\xa0months of age, before the first cochlear implant surgery, which excluded middle ear pathology. The mass was removed as an intact pearl, without visible or'}\n",

      "\n",
      "Collect comprehensive, up-to-date clinical guidelines and studies on cochlear implant (CI) candidacy with emphasis on patients who have undergone middle ear surgeries such as tympanoplasties or have a history of cholesteatoma. Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\n",

      "\n",
      "### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness. For patients with prior middle ear surgeries like tympanoplasty and history of cholesteatoma, candidacy assessment requires careful multidisciplinary evaluation with attention to middle ear status. The ear should be free of infection and active disease, with confirmed cochlear and nerve integrity. Ossicular chain interruptions and conductive hearing loss components should be identified and differentiated as they influence candidacy decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is feasible if disease is eradicated and no residual pathology remains. Simultaneous cochlear implantation and cholesteatoma removal can be performed safely when the disease is limited and the cholesteatoma capsule intact with laser ablation to reduce recurrence. Otherwise, staged surgery is warranted. Thorough imaging preoperatively and close postoperative follow-up are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "These evidence-based criteria and clinical considerations should guide candidacy evaluations and surgical planning in this complex patient subset to optimize outcomes.\n",

Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\\n\\n## Research Findings\\n\\n### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\\n\\n- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\\n\\n- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\\n\\n- CI candidacy should be considered on an ear-specific basis rather than using the better ear as the reference point, with emphasis on speech recognition scores (≤ 50% on CNC word test in the ear to be implanted) and aided speech recognition testing (e.g., AzBio sentences in noise).\\n\\n- Hearing preservation is possible and residual low-frequency hearing should not be a contraindication; electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) should be considered in these cases.\\n\\n- A multidisciplinary evaluation involving audiologists, CI surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and support systems is critical for tailored candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\\n\\n- Factors such as duration of deafness, etiology, amplification use, cognitive status, motivation, and social support impact outcomes and should be considered in candidacy assessment.\\n\\n- Imaging (high-resolution CT and MRI) is used to assess cochlear and middle ear anatomy prior to implantation.\\n\\n- Vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis is recommended for all adult CI candidates.\\n\\n- Off-label implants beyond FDA labeling are common and should be considered when clinical evidence supports benefit.\\n\\n### Candidacy in Patients with Prior Tympanoplasty or Middle Ear Pathology\\n\\n- Middle ear pathology and prior surgeries (e.g., tympanoplasty) are not absolute contraindications but may affect timing and ear selection.\\n\\n- Middle ear must be free of active infection and dry before implantation.\\n\\n- Integrity of the cochlear lumen and cochlear nerve is essential, assessed by imaging.\\n\\n- Disruptions of the ossicular chain and conductive components need to be differentiated from sensorineural losses; mixed losses can affect candidacy and hearing aid benefit.\\n\\n### Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma\\n\\n- Patients with a history of cholesteatoma require careful assessment before CI.\\n\\n- Active, infected, or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma must be ruled out; the ear should be dry with no evidence of active disease prior to implantation.\\n\\n- The cochlear lumen and nerve must be intact.\\n\\n- Imaging (HRCT and MRI) is essential for preoperative evaluation and exclusion of recurrent disease.\\n\\n- Cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously if the cholesteatoma is limited and the capsule is intact, with use of laser vaporization to reduce recurrence risk.\\n\\n- In cases where the cholesteatoma is extensive, capsule integrity is lost, or recurrence risk is high, staging the procedure (removal first, implant later) is recommended.\\n\\n- A reported case describes discovery of congenital cholesteatoma found incidentally during sequential cochlear implantation in a child despite prior imaging, highlighting the possibility of occult disease in this population.\\n\\n- Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examination, is important to detect residual or recurrent disease.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness.

The fitting of a cochlear implant is an innovative technique that totally changed therapeutic strategy of both congenital and acquired sensorineural hearing loss. With this device, as long as the cochlear nerve has kept its integrity, patients with acquired hearing loss have a considerable chance of improving or restoring verbal communication, and infants with congenital hearing loss subsequently may show very good linguistic development. Even though profound bilateral hearing loss is complicated with some pathology, basic requirement for the candidate of cochlear implantation stays the same.\\n\\n### 12.1 Indications\\n\\n### General Indications for Cochlear Implantation\\n\\nProfound (or total) bilateral hearing loss with little or insufficient benefits from conventional hearing aids in the presence of the following:\\n\\n*   Good health condition.\\n\\n*   Motivation to hear (adults).\\n\\n*   Support from the family (children).\\n\\nIn same particular case of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is required either in the same stage, or as a second-stage procedure to restore hearing. In contrast to cochlear implantation in normal middle ear in which the electrode array is inserted through posterior tympanotomy, the surgeon should take risk of recurrent disease into consideration. Canal wall down and radical cavities after cholesteatoma surgery force surgeon to place the lead of electrode array close to the surface if the cavity is maintained. Therefore, different strategy to avoid complications needs to be applied.\\n\\n### Indications of Cochlear Implantation with Subtotal Petrosectomy in Cholesteatoma Surgery\\n\\nProfound (or total) bilateral hearing loss with little or insufficient benefits from conventional hearing aids in the presence of the following:\\n\\n*   Middle ear cholesteatoma.\\n\\n*   Radical or canal wall down cavity with/without inflammation.\\n\\n*   Petrous bone cholesteatoma with preserved cochlea and cochlear nerve.\\n\\nRecurrence of cholesteatoma in the implanted ear or shallow placement of electrode array in the open cavity gives risks of extrusion of the cochlear implant. If the ear gets infection, the risks of breakdown of the retroauricular skin covering the internal unit and even meningitis arise. Combination of cochlear implantation with subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration significantly reduce such danger, since the procedure separates the cavity from external environment and eliminates possibility of recurrent disease. In some cases of petrous bone cholesteatoma, cholesteatoma is removed with translabyrinthine approach. The labyrinthectomy leads to postoperative ossification and/or fibrosis of the cochlea, making cochlear implantation in future impossible. If the surgeon preserves the cochlea, an electrode array may be inserted in the same stage depending on its necessity.\\n\\nAn electrode is inserted into the scala tympani of the cochlea through either the round window or a cochleostomy created in the promontory. We prefer to use round window approach whenever possible, just because it is more natural anatomically. However, in case of cholesteatoma, the round window is often obliterated with ossification, and need of drilling on the area of the round window is frequently encountered. In addition, the basal turn of the cochlea may be ossified due to inflammatory process, requiring further drilling of the cochlea. To create a cochleostomy in appropriate position in such complicated situations, full anatomical knowledge of the middle ear and inner ear is required.\\n\\nThe surgeon should recognize that insertion of the electrode is just the start of cochlear implantation. Cochlear implantation is a system of therapy that comprises not only surgery but also postoperative fitting and rehabilitation that require a range of other professional skills and teamworking with audiologists, speech therapists, and electrophysiologists. Currently, devices produced by four companies are available in the market. Each device has its own advantages over others, but the indication for any particular patient is not known fully, especially cases with cholesteatoma. Experience with this new device is accumulating, and further studies are required.\\n\\n### 12.2 Contraindications\\n\\nRelative contraindications arise in the presence of active purulent infection with multiresistant microorganisms or tuberculosis. The procedure can be staged when the risk of postoperative infection is considered to be high. In such cases, subtotal petrosectomy with total eradication of the infection under antibiotic coverage is performed in the first stage. After 3 to 6 months when there is no sign of infection, the obliterated cavity is reopened to perform cochlear implantation. The same strategy is applied to cholesteatoma when the surgeon is suspicious of complete removal.\\n\\nThe required surgical steps are shown in cases described below. In contrast to other middle ear procedures, the surgery requires hair shaving and usually facial nerve monitoring.\\n\\n### _Case 12.1 (Right Ear): Cochlear Implantation in Acquired Cholesteatoma_\\n\\nSee ![Image 1: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.1](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f001), ![Image 2: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.2](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f002), ![Image 3: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.3](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f003), ![Image 4: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.4](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f004), ![Image 5: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.5](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f005), ![Image 6: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.6](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f006), ![Image 7: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.7](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f007), ![Image 8: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.8](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f008), ![Image 9: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.9](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f009), ![Image 10: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.10](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f010), ![Image 11: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.11](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f011), ![Image 12: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.12](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f012), ![Image 13: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.13](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f013), ![Image 14: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.14](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f014), ![Image 15: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.15](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f015), ![Image 16: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.16](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f016), ![Image 17: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.17](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f017), ![Image 18: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.18](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f018), ![Image 19: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.19](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f019), ![Image 20: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.20](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f020), ![Image 21: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.21](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f021), ![Image 22: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.22](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f022).\\n\\n![Image 23](https://i0.wp.com/entokey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-1055-b-006-160283_c012_f001.jpg?w=960)\\n\\n**Fig. 12.1** A case of cholesteatoma with profound hearing loss in both ears.

As the aeration of the middle ear is associated with hearing outcome, we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing after the BOT may be better compared to CWU and CWD without obliteration.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nThis is a retrospective cohort study on all adult patients who underwent the BOT, CWU without obliteration or CWD without obliteration for primary or revision cholesteatoma between January 2003 and March 2019 with audiological follow-up at our institution. Pre-operative, short-term post-operative and long-term post-operative hearing tests were analyzed and potential factors influencing post-operative hearing were assessed.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\n626 ears were included. We found no significant differences between the short-term and long-term post-operative audiometry. The pre-operative air–bone gap (ABG) was the factor with the largest effect size on change in air–bone gap (ABG) between pre- and post-operative. When stratifying for this factor along with the type of ossicular chain reconstruction to account for differences at baseline, no significant differences in post-operative ABG were found between BOT and non-obliteration CWU and CWD.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn this large retrospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and the non-obliteration CWU and CWD. A solid comparison of hearing between groups remains very challenging as hearing outcome seems to be dependent on many different factors. Hearing outcome seems to be no additional argument to choose for BOT over non-obliteration surgery.\\n\\n### Supplementary Information\\n\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00405-022-07367-x.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Cholesteatoma, Bony obliteration tympanoplasty, Canal wall up, Canal wall downhearing, Udiological results BOT, CWU, CWD\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nAlthough the primary goal of cholesteatoma surgery is complete disease removal with the lowest possible recurrent cholesteatoma rates, optimal post-operative hearing is an important secondary goal and paramount to the patient involved [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR1)]. It is hard to offer reliable individual patient counseling on post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery as post-operative hearing is not only dependent on factors such as the ossicular chain status, ossicular chain reconstruction [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR2)–[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR4)] and extension of cholesteatoma [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR5)], but it is also suggested that factors as the aeration of the middle ear [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR6)–[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR8)] are associated with the hearing outcome.\\n\\nObliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space is becoming a more and more established technique in cholesteatoma surgery with promising outcome concerning recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)]. It is stated that mastoid obliteration causes a reduction in mucosal surface for gas exchange and that it, therefore, can improve the gas pressure balance in the middle ear resulting in slower gas absorption and slower pressure changes [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR10)] and that mastoid obliteration facilitates better aeration of the middle ear [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR11)]. Since post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery is influenced, among other things, by aeration of the middle ear, we hypothesize that the hearing results after mastoid obliteration in cholesteatoma surgery may be better compared to non-obliterative techniques. While many previous researchers have reported on post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery, there is no study that compares mastoid obliteration to non-obliterative techniques with respect to post-operative hearing.\\n\\nIn our institution, the canal wall up with mastoid obliteration (bony obliteration tympanoplasty, BOT) was introduced in 2013 and gradually replaced the canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) approach without mastoid obliteration. As these different surgical techniques were performed by the same surgeons in the same institution, it is interesting to compare the audiological results of these approaches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the audiological results after BOT to those after CWU and CWD without mastoid obliteration in our cohort and to compare our results with literature.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n---------------------\\n\\n### Patients\\n\\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted at the department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of the Erasmus Medical Center (tertiary referral center) with approval of the medical research ethical committee. All adult patients (≥ 18 years) who underwent the BOT, CWU without mastoid obliteration or CWD without mastoid obliteration for primary or recurrent cholesteatoma between January 2003 and March 2019 were included. Cases without audiological follow-up or with other surgical techniques than mentioned above (i.e., partial mastoid obliteration) were excluded. As the BOT was introduced in 2013 in our institution, all included cases before this introduction consist of CWU and CWD without obliteration. As the BOT was gradually introduced, the included cases from the year 2013 onwards consist of both BOT and the non-obliteration approaches.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nPatient demographics, surgical technique, primary versus revision surgery, audiological results (as described below), extension of cholesteatoma according to the STAMCO classification [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR12)], ossicular chain status before and after cholesteatoma removal, type of middle ear reconstruction and most recent follow-up date were collected from electronic patient records. The surgical technique was classified as either (1) BOT (2) CWU without obliteration or (3) CWD without obliteration. The ossicular chain status before and after surgery was classified as (1) intact chain, (2) incus absent with intact stapes, (3) stapes superstructure absent with or without intact incus, or (4) footplate fixation. The type of middle ear reconstruction was classified as (1) no reconstruction due to intact chain, (2) no reconstruction due to unfavorable middle ear aspects, (3) incus interposition, (4) partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), (5) tympanic membrane to stapes (type III tympanoplasty), (6) total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), or (7) tympanic membrane directly to footplate (type IV tympanoplasty).\\n\\n### Surgical technique\\n\\nThe BOT, CWU and CWD were performed under general anesthesia. The BOT was performed as described by Offeciers [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR13)] and van Dinther et al. [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR14), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR15)]. Two grams of cefazolin was administrated intravenously prior to surgery and if necessary repeated after 4 h. After a wide retro-auricular incision, cortical bone chips and cortical bone dust were harvested and stored in a rifamycin solution (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA. Rifadin® 600 mg powder for infusion with 10 mL solvent for solution and 20 mL 0.9% sodium chloride). A cortical mastoidectomy was performed leaving the posterior canal wall intact, followed by a wide posterior tympanotomy and epitympanotomy. If still present, the malleus head and incus were removed. After removal of all cholesteatoma and accessible cell tracts, bone chips were used to separate the epitympanum and mastoid from the middle ear. The cavity was filled with autologous bone pate and/or bioactive glass granules S53P4 (Bonealive®, Bonalive Biomaterials Ltd., Turku, Finland). If possible an ossicular chain reconstruction was performed using either autologous material (incus interposition or cartilage graft) or a titanium prosthesis. The tympanic membrane was reconstructed using cartilage or temporal fascia. Finally, the ear canal was packed with a gauze with hydrocortisone/oxytetracycline/polymixin B for at least 1 week. In CWU and CWD without mastoid obliteration, usually no antibiotics were administrated prior to surgery. A cortical mastoidectomy was performed with preservation of the posterior canal wall for CWU surgery and removal of the posterior canal wall in cases of CWD surgery. When necessary in CWU surgery, the scutum was reconstructed with bone chips or cartilage. If possible an ossicular chain reconstruction was performed and the tympanic membrane was reconstructed with cartilage or temporal fascia. As with the BOT, the ear canal or mastoid bowl was packed with a gauze with hydrocortisone/oxytetracycline/polymixin B for at least 1 week.\\n\\n### Audiological evaluation\\n\\nFor each case, the pure tone averages (PTA) calculated over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz for the air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) threshold were obtained from the electronic patient records from the pre-operative and short-term post-operative hearing test (≥ 6 weeks post-surgery) and if available from the long-term post-operative hearing test (≥ 12 months post-surgery). All thresholds were measured according to the shortened ascending method based on ISO standard 8253–1, which means that thresholds were defined by the intensity level at which the tone was heard in 2 out of 3 ascents. All testing was performed in a sound-attenuated booth at our outpatient department, on clinical audiometers (Decos audiology workstation), calibrated according to international standards. Threshold levels beyond the maximum stimulus level of the audiometer were registered as 120 dB HL.\\n\\n### Statistical analyses\\n\\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). Because of not normally distributed data, the Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to assess for significant differences between the three surgical techniques. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to calculate the effect size of different variables on change in ABG based on the Z-score of this test. An effect size between 0.10 and 0.30 was indicated as a small effect size, 0.30–0.50 as a medium effect size, and > 0.50 as a large effect size [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR16)]. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to assess for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\n### Subgroup analyses\\n\\nTo address the heterogenicity between different groups, variables with a relatively large effect size or clinical relevance on change in ABG were determined. We stratified for these variables in a subgroup analyses for differences in audiological outcome between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques. As the ossicular chain is per definition not intact after the BOT (i.e., the malleus head and incus are removed), cases in the CWU and CWD group with an intact chain after cholesteatoma removal were excluded for this subgroup analyses, facilitating the fairest possible comparison between the surgical techniques.\\n\\nResults\\n-------\\n\\nBetween January 2003 and March 2019, 626 ears of 558 patients underwent a BOT, CWU without obliteration or CWD without obliteration for cholesteatoma with audiological follow-up at our institution. Short-term audiometry was available for all 626 patients and long-term audiometry was available for 560 patients. The median time from surgery to hearing test was 14 weeks (IQR 11–20 weeks) for the short-term audiometry and 20 months (IQR 12–51 months) for the long-term audiometry. One-hundred and ninety-eight (31.6%) cases consisted of BOT, 275 (43.9%) consisted of CWU without obliteration and 153 (24.5%) consisted of CWD without obliteration. In the BOT group 73 cases (36.9%) consisted of primary surgery and 125 (63.1%) revision surgery; in the CWU without obliteration group these numbers were 148 (53.8%) and 127 (46.2%), respectively, and in the CWD without obliteration group, these numbers were 97 (63.4%) and 56 (36.6%), respectively.

There were no clinically relevant differences in post-operative AC threshold, BC threshold and ABG between the short- and long-term audiometry. Due to a larger number of cases who underwent short-term audiometry, further analyses were performed using the short-term audiometry. For pre- and post-operative hearing, there was a significant difference in AC threshold, BC threshold level and ABG between the surgical techniques (_P_ = 0.000, _P_ = 0.000 and _P_ = 0.006, respectively, for pre-operative hearing and _P_ = 0.000, _P_ = 0.000 and _P_ = 0.000, respectively, for post-operative hearing). There were no differences in change of AC threshold, BC threshold and ABG between the different groups.

A positive effect size implicates relatively more patients with an improvement of ABG, whereas a negative effect size implicates relatively more patients with deterioration of ABG. The pre-operative ABG seems to have a relatively large effect size on the change in ABG and was included in the subgroup analyses for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques (Table [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab4)). Because of clinical relevance, we also included the ossicular chain reconstruction in these analyses; cases with an intact ossicular chain after cholesteatoma removal were excluded for this subgroup analyses. For all variables, no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques were found. There were some small non-significant differences of only a few decibels per group, but they are considered clinically irrelevant.\\n\\n#### Table 4.\\n\\nSubgroup analysis for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques\\n\\n|  |  | BOT |  | CWU and CWD without obliteration |  | _P_ |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| _N_ (%) | Median post-operative ABG in dB HL (IQR) | _N_ (%) | Median post-operative ABG in dB HL (IQR) |\\n| Pre-operative ABG < 20 dB | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 5 | 22.5 (16.3–26.9) | 7 | 20.0 (15.0–36.3) | 0.870 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 7 | 13.8 (8.8–15.0) | 13 | 12.5 (7.5–16.9) | 0.781 |\\n|  | PORP | 30 | 16.3 (9.7–21.6) | 25 | 15.0 (12.5–21.3) | 0.722 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 22 | 18.8 (13.4–26.3) | 91 | 17.5 (11.3–22.5) | 0.093 |\\n|  | TORP | 7 | 26.3 (15.0–33.8) | 2 | 19.4 (16.3–NA) | 0.769 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 0 | NA | 11 | 17.5 (12.5–27.5) | NA |\\n|  | Total | 71 | 17.5 (12.5–22.5) | 149 | 16.3 (11.3–22.5) | 0.471 |\\n| Pre-operative ABG 20–40 dB HL | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 23 | 31.3 (23.8–35.0) | 22 | 28.1 (20.0–33.4) | 0.351 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 3 | 18.8 (3.8–NA) | 3 | 8.8 (6.3–NA) | 0.827 |\\n|  | PORP | 27 | 21.3 (16.3–31.3) | 22 | 18.1 (13.4–26.6) | 0.344 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 22 | 22.5 (19.4–34.7) | 102 | 25.0 (17.5–32.5) | 0.786 |\\n|  | TORP | 23 | 23.8 (17.5–32.5) | 11 | 20.0 (11.3–23.8) | 0.090 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 1 | 30.0 | 33 | 28.8 (23.8–36.9) | 0.878 |\\n|  | Total | 99 | 23.8 (17.5–33.1) | 193 | 25.0 (17.5–32.5) | 0.975 |\\n| Pre-operative ABG ≥ 40 dB HL | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 5 | 35.0 (34.4–41.3) | 6 | 37.5 (29.7–42.8) | 1.000 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 1 | 31.3 | 0 | NA | NA |\\n|  | PORP | 4 | 32.5 (15.0–35.0) | 6 | 30.0 (29.5–35.0) | 0.819 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 7 | 25.0 (20.0–37.5) | 12 | 33.1 (21.3–35.9) | 1.000 |\\n|  | TORP | 5 | 20.0 (17.8–24.5) | 7 | 21.3 (18.8–25.0) | 0.515 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 0 | NA | 8 | 36.9 (23.8–42.2) | NA |\\n|  | Total | 22 | 30.6 (20.0–35.0) | 39 | 30.0 (23.8–38.8) | 0.498 |\\n| Missing |  | 6 |  | 10 |  |  |\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/table/Tab4/)\\n\\n_BOT_ bony obliteration tympanoplasty, _CWU_ canal wall up, _ABG_ air–bone gap, _PORP_ partial ossicular replacement prosthesis, _TM_ tympanic membrane, _TORP_ total ossicular replacement prosthesis\\n\\nCases with intact ossicular chain were excluded\\n\\nDiscussion\\n----------\\n\\nIn this study, we evaluated and compared the hearing outcome after the BOT versus the non-obliteration CWU and CWD in a large patient cohort in our tertiary referral center. As the aeration of the middle ear is associated with hearing outcome [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR7)], we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing after the BOT may be better compared to the non-obliteration CWU and CWD technique. However, we found no significant differences in hearing outcome between those surgical techniques, but comparison of the different groups is challenging as post-operative hearing is influenced by many factors.\\n\\nSince the introduction of mastoid obliteration in canal wall down (CWD) cholesteatoma surgery with canal wall reconstruction by Mercke in 1987 [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR17)], many have reported on their outcomes after mastoid obliteration using different surgical approaches (CWU and CWD) and obliteration materials [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)]. With a mean recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rate of 4.6% and 5.4%, respectively [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)], the surgical outcome of obliterative techniques are overall better compared to the non-obliteration CWU and CWD in which recurrence rates (recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rate combined) of 4–70% are reported [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR18)]. While the recurrent and residual rates after obliteration and non-obliteration cholesteatoma surgery are well described in literature, the audiological results remain underexposed as there are no comparative studies on hearing results after BOT verus CWU and CWD without obliteration. Several studies reported on hearing results after BOT or CWU/CWD without obliteration alone, in which the audiological success rate ranges from 19 to 75% (Table [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab5)). The most common used success criterion in these studies is the percentage of cases with a post-operative ABG ≤ 20 dB, which was achieved in 19%–55.9% in the mastoid obliteration studies and 51.8–73% in the CWU/CWD without obliteration studies. In our cohort, a post-operative ABG ≤ 20 dB was achieved in 44.4% after the BOT and in 49.5% after CWU/CWD without obliteration. However, it is difficult if not impossible to systematically compare the hearing outcome of these studies as the post-operative hearing is dependent on many factors which are not commonly reported on, such as the ossicular chain status, ossicular chain reconstruction, pre-operative hearing, extension of cholesteatoma and middle ear aeration. A difference in prevalence of these factors may have caused the broad spread of results between these studies.\\n\\n### Table 5.\\n\\nComparison of hearing outcome with literature\\n\\n| Study | Year | Population | No. of cases | Surgical technique | Success criterion | % Success | % Success in the present study with this criterion for BOT | % Success in the present study with this criterion for non-obliteration CWU/CWD |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| Lee et al.

Importantly, no conclusions can be drawn when analyzing the total group of patients due to the significant heterogenicity in patient characteristics between the treatment groups at baseline. As seen in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1), factors with a positive effect on improvement of hearing were more frequently seen in the CWU without obliteration group (smaller pre-operative ABG, smaller cholesteatoma according to the STAM classification). We found that the pre-operative ABG has a relatively large effect size on change in ABG between pre- and post-operative (supplemental Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1)). When stratifying for this factor along with the ossicular chain reconstruction due to clinical relevance to account for difference at baseline (Table [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab4)), no significant differences in post-operative ABG were found between BOT and non-obliteration CWU and CWD. This was against our expectations, as we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing results after mastoid obliteration may be better compared to non-obliteration techniques. One of the rationales behind mastoid obliteration is that reducing the mucosal surface for gas exchange can result in slower gas absorption and slower pressure changes, resulting in less pathologic abnormalities of the middle ear [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR10)]. While it is generally assumed that this results in an improved tympanic cavity aeration and thus in better hearing, the scientific evidence on this is weak and our data does not support this theory. It is stated that mastoid obliteration facilitates aeration of the middle ear [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR11), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR19)], but these studies do not compare the aeration of obliteration surgery with the aeration of non-obliteration surgery. The only comparative study on this subject was performed by Vartiainen et al. in 1987 [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR20)], in which an adhesive tympanic membrane was seen in 12% after both CWU with obliteration and CWU without obliteration. However, in this study the epitympanic space was not obliterated, which may have caused an underestimation of the potentially positive effect of obliteration on middle ear aeration as it is suggested that the epitympanum plays an important role in the gas exchange due to highly vascularized mucosa compared to the pro-, meso- and hypotympanum [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR21)]. Due to the retrospective design of the present study, no data on pre- and post-operative middle ear aeration were available. Further research is required to prospectively assess the role of mastoid and epitympanic obliteration on middle ear aeration.\\n\\nOther explanations for the fact that we observed no differences in hearing outcome between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques may be sought in the limitations of this study. Limitations include the retrospective design, the possible bias and confounding factors and the lack of power due to relatively low patient numbers after stratification. The motives to perform a CWU or CWD without obliteration over a BOT were not always clear due to the retrospective design of the study. It is plausible that, especially in the first period after the introduction of the BOT in our institution, there has been positive selection bias for large cholesteatoma due to an adaption period for the surgeons in changing their surgical approach. Even today the CWU without obliteration is still sometimes performed at our institution in some cases of limited, primary or small cholesteatoma, while the BOT is performed in more extensive cases in which before a CWD approach would have been performed, causing a possible indication bias. As shown in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1) for example, the CWU without obliteration group consisted of more small cholesteatoma (STAM 1), less large cholesteatoma (STAM 3) and less cases with an absent stapes compared to the BOT group; all cases which were associated with a smaller post-operative ABG (Supplemental Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1)). We tried to minimalize the effect of this bias on our outcome by performing subgroup analyses in which we stratified for the variables with a relatively large effect size on post-operative hearing. While we believe that this was the best possible statistical method on this retrospective data, it is conceivable that the cases in the BOT group consisted of more severe or pathologic cholesteatoma compared to the non-obliteration group and that we were not able to facilitate a fair comparison between the surgical techniques. This may have resulted in worse hearing outcome in the BOT group. Furthermore, there are still several possible confounding factors which we were not able to correct for such as the infection rate, antibiotics administration, tobacco use and experience of the surgeon. The infection rate is difficult to measure, but can potentially affect the stabilization of the middle ear and thus affect hearing. Also, the experience and skill of the surgeon may affect the hearing results, but data are lacking as skill is a subjective concept. Upcoming research on audiological results after cholesteatoma surgery should therefore focus on identifying as much as possible factors which influence post-operative hearing. Finally, as we found no differences in post-operative hearing between the BOT and CWU and CWD without obliteration, we prefer the BOT to non-obliteration surgery as the recurrent and residual rates are significantly lower and the hygienic results are excellent after the former technique [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)].\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn this large retrospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and the non-obliteration CWU and CWD. A solid comparison of hearing between groups remains very challenging as hearing outcome seems to be dependent on many different factors. Hearing outcome seems to be no additional argument to choose for BOT over non-obliteration surgery.\\n\\nSupplementary Information\\n-------------------------\\n\\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\\n\\n[Supplementary file1 (DOCX 14 KB)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/9519705/bin/405_2022_7367_MOESM1_ESM.docx) (14.1KB, docx) \\n\\nFunding\\n-------\\n\\nNone were declared.\\n\\nDeclarations\\n------------\\n\\n### Conflict of interest\\n\\nNone were declared.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n---------\\n\\n**Publisher's Note**\\n\\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n*   1.Quaranta N, Iannuzzi L, Petrone P, D'Elia A, Quaranta A.

Thirty-four pediatric cases and 26 adult cases are described in the literature. Cholesteatoma has a prevalence of 0.54% in pediatric CIs, and 1.79% in adult CIs (case series and literature). Adult cases were diagnosed significantly later compared to pediatric cases (Mann–Whitney test, _p_ = 0.0460). Three pediatric cholesteatomas were treated with conservative surgery and preservation of the CI; they all developed recurrent disease. The remaining pediatric cases underwent subtotal petrosectomy with simultaneous CI explantation and staged reimplantation. Only one case recurred. The adult cases underwent simultaneous subtotal petrosectomy, explantation, and reimplantation. Similarly, 33.3% of cases treated with conservative/reconstructive surgery in the literature required revision surgery or conversion to subtotal petrosectomy against 6.2% of subtotal petrosectomies in the literature.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nCholesteatoma after CI is a rare and late-onset complication of CIs. It is more prevalent in the adult CI population, although it affects children significantly earlier. The treatment of choice is subtotal petrosectomy and CI explantation with simultaneous or staged reimplantation.\\n\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y) to check access.\\n\\nAccess this article\\n-------------------\\n\\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y)\\n\\nSubscribe and save\\n------------------\\n\\nSpringer+ Basic\\n\\n$34.99 /Month\\n\\n*   Get 10 units per month\\n*   Download Article/Chapter or eBook\\n*   1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\\n*   Cancel anytime\\n\\n[Subscribe now](https://link.springer.com/product/springer-plus)\\n\\nBuy Now\\n-------\\n\\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\\n\\nPrice excludes VAT (USA) \\n\\n Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\\n\\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\\n\\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\\n\\n**Fig. 1**\\n\\n![Image 3](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y/MediaObjects/405_2023_8251_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n**Fig. 2**\\n\\n![Image 4](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y/MediaObjects/405_2023_8251_Fig2_HTML.png)\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n![Image 5](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-025-09471-0/MediaObjects/405_2025_9471_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n### [Iatrogenic cholesteatoma: a tertiary referral center experience](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00405-025-09471-0?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle 03 June 2025\\n\\n![Image 6](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40463-016-0119-5/MediaObjects/40463_2016_119_Fig1_HTML.gif)\\n\\n### [Cochlear implant and congenital cholesteatoma](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s40463-016-0119-5?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle Open access 01 February 2016\\n\\n![Image 7](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-015-3767-6/MediaObjects/405_2015_3767_Fig1_HTML.gif)\\n\\n### [Hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00405-015-3767-6?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle 03 September 2015\\n\\n### Explore related subjects\\n\\nDiscover the latest articles and news from researchers in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\\n*   [Cochlea](https://link.springer.com/subjects/cochlea)\\n*   [Ear manifestations](https://link.springer.com/subjects/ear-manifestations)\\n*   [Head and Neck Surgery](https://link.springer.com/subjects/head-and-neck-surgery)\\n*   [Inner ear](https://link.springer.com/subjects/inner-ear)\\n*   [Otorhinolaryngology](https://link.springer.com/subjects/otorhinolaryngology)\\n*   [Surgery](https://link.springer.com/subjects/surgery)\\n\\nData availability\\n-----------------\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n1.

      "Investigate and compile detailed information on surgical techniques, challenges, and risks associated with cochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment. Focus on electrode insertion strategies, risk of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, infection control, and postoperative complications. Include case reports and series that discuss outcomes and best practices in these complex surgical scenarios.\n",

      "## Surgical Techniques and Challenges in Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Staging and Timing**: Cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease cases with intact cholesteatoma capsule, or staged when disease extent or infection risk is high. Staged approaches involve subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration to isolate the cavity from the external environment, reducing risks of infection and implant extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Surgical Access and Electrode Insertion**: Unlike standard cochlear implantation where electrode insertion is done through posterior tympanotomy, ears with prior cholesteatoma surgery often involve canal wall down and radical cavities, necessitating alternate strategies to fix the electrode array close to the surface and stable fixation to prevent extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The round window approach is preferred for electrode insertion when anatomically feasible, but in cholesteatoma-treated ears, it can be obliterated by ossification or fibrosis from inflammation. Drilling (cochleostomy) may be required, demanding detailed anatomical knowledge due to altered structures and potential ossification of the cochlea basal turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Obliteration Techniques**: Subtotal petrosectomy combined with fat or bone pate obliteration of the mastoid and middle ear cavities is used to minimize dead space, reduce infection risk, and prevent recurrence, which is critical in cases with prior cholesteatoma. This also supports better implant stability and reduces extrusion risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Factors: Residual/Recurrent Cholesteatoma, Infection, and Complications\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Residual or Recurrent Disease**: Risk of residual cholesteatoma exists especially in cases where complete removal is uncertain. Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examinations, is essential for early detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Aggressive disease or incomplete removal warrants staged implantation after eradication confirmed, to decrease risk of recurrent disease affecting the implant.\n",

Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\\n\\n## Research Findings\\n\\n### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\\n\\n- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\\n\\n- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\\n\\n- CI candidacy should be considered on an ear-specific basis rather than using the better ear as the reference point, with emphasis on speech recognition scores (≤ 50% on CNC word test in the ear to be implanted) and aided speech recognition testing (e.g., AzBio sentences in noise).\\n\\n- Hearing preservation is possible and residual low-frequency hearing should not be a contraindication; electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) should be considered in these cases.\\n\\n- A multidisciplinary evaluation involving audiologists, CI surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and support systems is critical for tailored candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\\n\\n- Factors such as duration of deafness, etiology, amplification use, cognitive status, motivation, and social support impact outcomes and should be considered in candidacy assessment.\\n\\n- Imaging (high-resolution CT and MRI) is used to assess cochlear and middle ear anatomy prior to implantation.\\n\\n- Vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis is recommended for all adult CI candidates.\\n\\n- Off-label implants beyond FDA labeling are common and should be considered when clinical evidence supports benefit.\\n\\n### Candidacy in Patients with Prior Tympanoplasty or Middle Ear Pathology\\n\\n- Middle ear pathology and prior surgeries (e.g., tympanoplasty) are not absolute contraindications but may affect timing and ear selection.\\n\\n- Middle ear must be free of active infection and dry before implantation.\\n\\n- Integrity of the cochlear lumen and cochlear nerve is essential, assessed by imaging.\\n\\n- Disruptions of the ossicular chain and conductive components need to be differentiated from sensorineural losses; mixed losses can affect candidacy and hearing aid benefit.\\n\\n### Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma\\n\\n- Patients with a history of cholesteatoma require careful assessment before CI.\\n\\n- Active, infected, or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma must be ruled out; the ear should be dry with no evidence of active disease prior to implantation.\\n\\n- The cochlear lumen and nerve must be intact.\\n\\n- Imaging (HRCT and MRI) is essential for preoperative evaluation and exclusion of recurrent disease.\\n\\n- Cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously if the cholesteatoma is limited and the capsule is intact, with use of laser vaporization to reduce recurrence risk.\\n\\n- In cases where the cholesteatoma is extensive, capsule integrity is lost, or recurrence risk is high, staging the procedure (removal first, implant later) is recommended.\\n\\n- A reported case describes discovery of congenital cholesteatoma found incidentally during sequential cochlear implantation in a child despite prior imaging, highlighting the possibility of occult disease in this population.\\n\\n- Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examination, is important to detect residual or recurrent disease.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness. For patients with prior middle ear surgeries like tympanoplasty and history of cholesteatoma, candidacy assessment requires careful multidisciplinary evaluation with attention to middle ear status. The ear should be free of infection and active disease, with confirmed cochlear and nerve integrity. Ossicular chain interruptions and conductive hearing loss components should be identified and differentiated as they influence candidacy decisions.\\n\\nIn cases of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is feasible if disease is eradicated and no residual pathology remains. Simultaneous cochlear implantation and cholesteatoma removal can be performed safely when the disease is limited and the cholesteatoma capsule intact with laser ablation to reduce recurrence. Otherwise, staged surgery is warranted. Thorough imaging preoperatively and close postoperative follow-up are essential.\\n\\nThese evidence-based criteria and clinical considerations should guide candidacy evaluations and surgical planning in this complex patient subset to optimize outcomes.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [American Cochlear Implant Alliance Task Force: Recommendations for Determining Cochlear Implant Candidacy in Adults (Laryngoscope, 2023)](https://www.audiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Laryngoscope-2023-Zeitler-American-Cochlear-Implant-Alliance-Task-Force-Recommendations-for-Determining-Cochlear.pdf)\\n\\n- [Cochlear implant and congenital cholesteatoma (Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/)\\n\\n- [Management of Cholesteatoma - Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024 Article)](https://www.oto.theclinics.com/article/S0030-6665(24)00111-7/fulltext)\\n\\n- [Clinical Practice Guideline: Cochlear Implants - American Speech-Language-Hearing Association](https://www.audiology.org/practice-guideline/clinical-practice-guideline-cochlear-implants/)\\n\\n- [Medicare Expands Cochlear Implant Candidacy Guidelines](https://neurotucson.com/medicare-expands-cochlear-implant-candidacy-guidelines/)\\n\\n## Images\\n\\n![Cochlear Implant: Audiogram showing hearing thresholds](https://entmanitoba.com/sites/default/files/styles/half_width/public/2023-05/Picture3.png?itok=SlspHvBu)\\n\\n![Graphic representing cochlear implant candidacy criteria for post-tympanoplasty cholesteatoma patients](https://assets.cochlear.com/api/public/content/1597f74884b249aeac497056925020fb?v=e6bcfa12)\\n</finding>\\n\\n## Existing Finding 2: Investigate Surgical Considerations and Risks for Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\\n\\n<finding>\\n# Problem Statement\\n\\nInvestigate and compile detailed information on surgical techniques, challenges, and risks associated with cochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment. Focus on electrode insertion strategies, risk of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, infection control, and postoperative complications. Include case reports and series that discuss outcomes and best practices in these complex surgical scenarios.\\n\\n# Research Findings\\n\\n## Surgical Techniques and Challenges in Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\\n\\n- **Staging and Timing**: Cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease cases with intact cholesteatoma capsule, or staged when disease extent or infection risk is high. Staged approaches involve subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration to isolate the cavity from the external environment, reducing risks of infection and implant extrusion.\\n\\n- **Surgical Access and Electrode Insertion**: Unlike standard cochlear implantation where electrode insertion is done through posterior tympanotomy, ears with prior cholesteatoma surgery often involve canal wall down and radical cavities, necessitating alternate strategies to fix the electrode array close to the surface and stable fixation to prevent extrusion.\\n\\n- The round window approach is preferred for electrode insertion when anatomically feasible, but in cholesteatoma-treated ears, it can be obliterated by ossification or fibrosis from inflammation. Drilling (cochleostomy) may be required, demanding detailed anatomical knowledge due to altered structures and potential ossification of the cochlea basal turn.\\n\\n- **Obliteration Techniques**: Subtotal petrosectomy combined with fat or bone pate obliteration of the mastoid and middle ear cavities is used to minimize dead space, reduce infection risk, and prevent recurrence, which is critical in cases with prior cholesteatoma. This also supports better implant stability and reduces extrusion risks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors: Residual/Recurrent Cholesteatoma, Infection, and Complications\\n\\n- **Residual or Recurrent Disease**: Risk of residual cholesteatoma exists especially in cases where complete removal is uncertain. Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examinations, is essential for early detection.\\n\\n- Aggressive disease or incomplete removal warrants staged implantation after eradication confirmed, to decrease risk of recurrent disease affecting the implant.\\n\\n- **Infection Risk**: Prior middle ear pathology and surgeries heighten infection risk post-implantation. Infection can present as skin flap breakdown, implant extrusion, or rarely meningitis.\\n\\n- Combination of subtotal petrosectomy with obliteration techniques significantly reduces infection risk by disconnecting the middle ear cavity from the external environment.\\n\\n- Perioperative antibiotic strategies are applied variably but are important for infection prophylaxis.\\n\\n## Postoperative Complications and Outcomes\\n\\n- Postoperative complications reported include skin flap problems, implant extrusion, electrode exposure, and delayed infection.\\n\\n- Case series report low but nonzero prevalence of acquired cholesteatoma after cochlear implantation, sometimes necessitating explantation and staged reimplantation.\\n\\n- Hearing outcomes after cochlear implantation in ears previously treated for cholesteatoma and tympanoplasty are generally favorable when appropriate surgical techniques are used, although ossicular chain status and middle ear environment influence outcomes.\\n\\n- Large retrospective cohorts comparing bony obliteration tympanoplasty (BOT) to canal wall up/down without obliteration showed no significant differences in hearing outcomes but noted better hygiene and lower disease recurrence with BOT, supporting its use in complex cases.\\n\\n## Case Reports and Series Insights\\n\\n- Several reports highlight the feasibility and safety of simultaneous or staged cochlear implantation with cholesteatoma surgery in select patients.\\n\\n- One key approach is subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration combined with cochlear implantation to achieve disease control and implant stability.\\n\\n- Delayed complications such as electrode array exposure have been reported, emphasizing the need for meticulous surgical technique and postoperative follow-up.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment requires specialized surgical techniques distinct from standard implantation.

This is because a pathology anywhere from the pinna and the external acoustic meatus to the foot of the stapes bone can produce a conductive hearing loss (abnormal mechanical transmission of sound from the EAC to the cochlea).[[2]](#article-19834.r2) Many anatomical structures in this area are susceptible to a wide range of pathologies.\\n\\nConductive hearing loss is prevalent and affects a wide demographic, from the very young to the elderly.[[3]](#article-19834.r3) The causes can also range from the trivial otitis media with effusion in young children to potentially severe conditions such as an effusion caused by a nasopharyngeal tumor in adults. Thus, a thorough understanding of conductive hearing loss is paramount for all clinicians. Conductive hearing loss is a disease process frequently encountered by otolaryngologists, general practitioners, nurses, and audiologists.\\n\\n## Etiology\\n\\nConductive hearing loss can be produced by any defect in the pinna, external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles, up to the footplate of the stapes. Problems with the external ear and auditory canal may be due to congenital abnormalities such as aural atresia, which results in the incomplete formation of the external ear. This anomaly occurs due to the maldevelopment of the first and second branchial arches and the first branchial cleft.[[4]](#article-19834.r4) More commonly, problems arise at the external canal by obstruction from debris, wax, or foreign bodies. Perforation of the tympanic membrane can also cause a conductive hearing loss.[[5]](#article-19834.r5) Perforation can be attributed to trauma using cotton swabs to clean the ear, barotrauma from deep water diving, or as a sequela of otitis media.\\n\\nPathologies in the middle ear resulting in a conductive hearing loss include acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (commonly referred to as glue ear). Otitis media with effusion is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in children.[[6]](#article-19834.r6) In most cases, it is a transient issue, which often recovers spontaneously, and no further management other than monitoring is required. However, in some children, hearing loss can have disastrous consequences on speech and language development. Middle ear effusions in an adult should raise suspicion of a nasopharyngeal tumor (particularly a unilateral effusion or a refractory effusion) and should be investigated as such.[[7]](#article-19834.r7) Another serious cause of conductive hearing loss is cholesteatomas. These occur due to the presence of squamous epithelium in the middle ear or other aerated areas within the temporal bones. Although they are not tumors, they can be locally destructive and therefore require surgical removal.[[8]](#article-19834.r8) Restoration of hearing is a secondary objective behind the formation of a safe, dry ear.\\n\\nA defect in the ossicles of the middle ear will also give a conductive hearing loss. This could be due to head trauma resulting in ossicle discontinuity, or it could be due to a disease process such as otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is an osseous dyscrasia within the temporal bone.[[9]](#article-19834.r9) Spongy bone from the otic capsule gets replaced by sclerotic bone. This process predominantly affects the anterior oval window, resulting in calcification of the stapes or the annular ligament. Otosclerosis is twice as common in women and presents in early adulthood with a gradual onset of conductive hearing loss due to the stapes' fixation.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\n\\nConductive hearing loss is common in younger patients due to conditions such as otitis media with effusion. A study on primary school children found the prevalence of hearing loss to be 15%, with 88.9% of those being conductive.[[10]](#article-19834.r10) Another study with preschool children in a South African community showed that 19% had hearing loss, with 65% of those being conductive.[[11]](#article-19834.r11) They found that 9% of children had impacted cerumen, causing a hearing loss in 19% of them. In a Canadian study in school children from kindergarten to grade 6, hearing loss was found in 19%, with 93% of those being conductive. They found perforations of the tympanic membrane in 37% if unilateral loss and 46% in the bilateral loss.[[12]](#article-19834.r12)\\n\\nIn low-middle income countries, hearing loss secondary to otitis media can be as high as 26%.[[13]](#article-19834.r13) Otosclerosis prevalence in the white population is 0.04% to 1% but increases to 5% in Asians, and is associated with bilateral hearing loss in up to 80% of cases.[[14]](#article-19834.r14) In the elderly population, hearing loss is mostly attributed to presbycusis, which is sensorineural.[[15]](#article-19834.r15)\\n\\n## History and Physical\\n\\nA thorough history can point towards the cause of the hearing loss. When obtaining the child's pertinent history, it is essential to ask about speech and language development and whether the appropriate milestones have been reached. Whether the child had preceding or recurrent upper respiratory tract infections must be ascertained, as this may suggest an otitis media with effusion. A conductive hearing loss can manifest as inappropriate behavior or inattention in the classroom.[[16]](#article-19834.r16)\\n\\nOther essential things in the history of children and adults include the onset of hearing loss, whether there was any trauma, and the presence of associated symptoms such as vertigo, otorrhoea, otalgia, and facial weakness. It would be prudent to ask about nasal discharge and weight loss in the older patient, indicating a postnasal space tumor. A child with a history of otitis media during the first two-three years of life are at risk for a mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss affecting phonological production. They can have difficulty perceiving strident or high-frequency consonants, such as sibilants. During speech they typically fail to produce these consonants, since they do not perceive them. This failure of sound production is called stridency deletion.\\n\\nIt is important to ask about family history and birth history to exclude any familial syndromes. Otosclerosis has an autosomal dominant with an incomplete penetrance mode of inheritance. It usually presents in the third decade of life and is twice as common in women as men. It has a gradual onset, and the hearing loss is bilateral in 80% of cases.[[17]](#article-19834.r17) The patient with otosclerosis may comment that their hearing is better with background noise (paracusis Willisii). This phenomenon can occur as well in other causes of conductive hearing loss.\\n\\nA full otolaryngology examination is mandatory for patients with hearing loss. Both ears must be examined with an otoscope or microscope. The examiner can see an obstruction of the ear canal with cerumen, debris, or a foreign body. Stenosis of the canal, which may be congenital or the consequence of repeated infections, can be seen. The tympanic membranes must be visualized to exclude acute infections, effusions, perforations, hemotympanum, or the presence of a cholesteatoma. Approximately 90% of patients with otosclerosis have normal tympanic membranes, while 10% have a pink tinge called Schwartz’s sign.[[18]](#article-19834.r18) If an adult is noted to have an effusion, then a flexible nasoendoscopy should be performed in the clinic to view the postnasal space.[[19]](#article-19834.r19)\\n\\nWeber and Rinne tuning fork tests are useful screening tests, which can be carried out in the clinic to see whether hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural.[[20]](#article-19834.r20) They are better suited for unilateral hearing loss and when the hearing loss is not of the mixed type. Cases of bilateral hearing loss or mixed hearing losses are better assessed using pure tone audiometry rather than tuning fork tests. To perform the Weber test, a 512Hz tuning fork is struck on the clinician's knee or elbow, and the vibrating fork is placed in the vertex of the patient’s head of the midline of the forehead. A normal result is a tuning fork being heard equally in both ears. In a conductive hearing loss, the tuning fork will be heard louder in the affected ear. In a sensorineural hearing loss, the tuning fork will be heard louder in the unaffected ear. This is used in conjunction with the Rinne test, where again a vibrating 512Hz tuning fork is placed, this time on the mastoid process until the patient can no longer hear it, and then 1cm away from the external acoustic meatus. A normal result is when air conduction is heard better than bone conduction (paradoxically called Rinne positive). If bone conduction is superior to air conduction (Rinne negative), a conductive hearing loss is present.\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\nPure tone audiometry is the mainstay of investigations for hearing loss. It can confirm the presence of hearing loss, quantify the severity, and determine the nature of the hearing loss.[[21]](#article-19834.r21) Headphones deliver sounds in varying loudness over 250 to 8000 Hz. The patient notifies the audiologist when they hear the sounds 50% of the time. This is a measure of the air conduction threshold and is recorded in decibels (dB). The bone conduction threshold is determined by placing a transducer on the mastoid process. An air-bone gap exists when bone conduction is superior to air conduction.[[22]](#article-19834.r22) This is significant when the gap is over 10dB and marks a conductive hearing loss. Usually, an air-bone gap over 40dB indicates pathology within the ossicular chain rather than solely a tympanic membrane pathology. A Carhart notch is where there is a depression in bone conduction of around 10 to 15dB at 2kHz.[[23]](#article-19834.r23) This is indicative of stapes fixation, as seen in otosclerosis.\\n\\nPure tone audiometry is suitable for patients over four years old. For younger children, there are alternative tests such as play and visual reinforcement audiometry. These are all subjective hearing tests. Acoustic impedance audiometry, also called tympanometry, provides some objective evidence for the examination. Tympanometry generates a graph of the tympanic membrane's compliance and gives useful information about the middle ear pressures.[[24]](#article-19834.r24)\\n\\nThe work-up for a patient with a suspected cholesteatoma should include a computed tomographic scan of the petrous temporal bones. Brain and cervical magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium may be subsequently recommended to exclude tumor pathologies of the posterior fossa, temporal bone, and neck/oropharynx areas.\\n\\n## Treatment / Management\\n\\nThe treatment of conductive hearing loss is dependent on the underlying condition. Any foreign body should be removed under direct visualization, with the aid of a microscope if required.[[25]](#article-19834.r25) Wax and debris which is obstructing the ear canal should be amenable to micro-suction. Perforations of the tympanic membrane often heal independently and only require a clinic follow-up evaluation in 6-8 weeks to ensure total healing.[[26]](#article-19834.r26) If the perforation has not sealed, then a myringoplasty may be necessary; however, the hearing effects are somewhat more unpredictable.\\n\\nOtitis media with effusion usually resolves by itself and can just be monitored every three months. However, if persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion occurs over three months, and the hearing loss in the better ear is over 25-30dB, grommet insertion may be valuable.[[27]](#article-19834.r27) Grommets enable ventilation of the middle ear to the external auditory canal, rather than ventilating to the nasopharynx via the Eustachian tubes. A myringotomy is performed, and any middle ear fluid is suctioned out before a grommet is placed in the anteroinferior quadrant. Adenoidectomy can also be performed if there is associated hearing loss with the effusions.[[28]](#article-19834.r28) The most common complications of grommets are infections and rarely tympanosclerosis. Grommets are favored to tympanostomy tubes (T-tubes) as the latter have higher rates of complications.[[29]](#article-19834.r29)\\n\\nCholesteatomas require complete surgical excision. The two main approaches to a mastoidectomy are canal wall down, which involves an endaural or postaural incision, or canal wall up, which involves a postauricular incision.[[30]](#article-19834.r30) Trauma resulting in ossicle discontinuity may require an ossiculoplasty. Management options for otosclerosis include conservative measures such as watchful waiting, hearing aids, and fluoride supplementation. Surgery may be indicated when the air-bone gap is over 20 dB and involve total/partial stapedectomy or stapedotomy.[[31]](#article-19834.r31) Conductive hearing loss that is not amenable to medical or surgical management can be treated with hearing aids. There are various types: air conduction hearing aids, bone conduction hearing aids, and bone-anchored hearing aid.\\n\\n## Differential Diagnosis\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis for conductive hearing loss is extensive. A thorough history and examination, together with pure tone audiometry, will point towards the underlying cause. It is essential to confirm that the hearing loss is conductive rather than sensorineural, guiding subsequent investigations and management.\\n\\n## Prognosis\\n\\nPrognosis is very much dependent on the cause of the conductive hearing loss. Simple conditions such as wax impaction and otitis media with effusion have excellent outcomes.[[32]](#article-19834.r32)[[33]](#article-19834.r33) Even when hearing loss is not reversible or amenable to medical or surgical management, hearing aids have a high satisfaction rate amongst patients.[[34]](#article-19834.r34)[[35]](#article-19834.r35)\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nThe following complications may be observed:\\n\\n## Consultations\\n\\nConsultations from otolaryngologists, neuro otologist, and audiologist may be required.\\n\\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\\n\\nPatients must realize that hearing loss, mainly if it is conductive, is treatable and should seek medical help if they noticed it. Hearing aids can be highly effective in cases when hearing loss is not treatable. Parents and teachers must be aware that misbehavior or inattention at school can be a sign of hearing loss, and prompt diagnosis can prevent speech and language delays. Patients should be instructed not to introduce sharp objects to clean the ear. The use of cotton swabs should be restricted to the most outer part of the external ear canal. Cotton swabs can push the wax deeper into the ear canal. In most cases, cleaning the ear canal should not be done with a cotton swab as the wax usually fall out on its own.\\n\\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\\n\\nHearing loss is a frequent problem affecting all ages. Careful diagnosis and treatment are required in many cases to prevent further complications. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary when managing conductive hearing loss, including otolaryngologists, audiologists, general practitioners, and specialty nurses. Pediatricians should closely follow patients with otitis media for recurrent episodes and problems in school learning and performance. Recommendations from all members of the team are obtained to achieve the best possible outcome for the patient. Using evidence-based information, the best results can be obtained.\\n\\n## Review Questions\\n\\n## References\\n\\n**Disclosure:** Thushanth Sooriyamoorthy declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\\n\\n**Disclosure:** Orlando De Jesus declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\\n\\nThis book is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\\n([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)), which permits others to distribute the work, provided that the article is not altered or used commercially.

This study aimed at evaluating their effectiveness in rehabilitation of hearing loss.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nThis study included patients who received bone conduction implants at Tertiary Teaching Hospitals, between December 2018 and November 2020. Data were collected prospectively, and patients were assessed both subjectively using COSI and GHABP questionnaires and objectively using bone conduction and air conduction thresholds, unaided and aided free field speech thresholds. Outcomes of transcutaneous (tBCHD) and percutaneous (pBCHD) bone conduction hearing devices were compared as well as outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral fitting. Postoperative skin complications were recorded and compared.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nA total of seventy patients were included, thirty-seven of them were implanted with tBCHD and thirty-three with pBCHD. Fifty-five patients were fitted unilaterally compared to 15 bilateral fitting. Preoperative mean of bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample was 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) with _P_ value = 0.00001. The postoperative assessment using GHABP showed a benefit score mean of 70.95 ± 18.79, patient satisfaction score mean of 78.15 ± 18.39. The disability score improved significantly from a mean of 54.08 ± 15.26 to residual score of only 12.50 ± 10.22 with _P_< 0.00001 postoperatively. There was significant improvement in all parameters of COSI questionnaire following fitting. Comparison of pBCHDs vs tBCHDs showed a non-significant difference regarding FF speech as well as GHABP parameters. Comparison of the post-operative skin complications was in favor of tBCHDs as (86.5%) of the patients had normal skin postoperatively, compared to 45.5% of patients with pBCHDs devices. Bilateral implantation showed significant improvement of FF speech scores, GHABP satisfaction score, as well as COSI score results.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBone conduction hearing devices are effective solution for rehabilitation of hearing loss. Bilateral fitting yields satisfactory outcomes in suitable candidates. Transcutaneous devices carry significantly lower skin complication rates compared to percutaneous devices.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Implantable hearing device, Deafness, BAHA, Osia, Bone conduction\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nConventional air conduction hearing aids (ACHA) are the standard of care for rehabilitation of moderate-to-severe hearing loss worldwide while cochlear implants are reserved for those with severe to profound hearing deficiencies [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR1)]. Patients with moderate to severe hearing loss who have no benefit from ACHAs or unable to wear them for various reasons needed an innovative option such as implantable hearing devices to fulfill their needs [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR2)].\\n\\nImplantable hearing devices have been developed to rehabilitate a wider range of hearing loss and overcome many of the drawbacks of the ACHAs that includes occlusion effect, inadequate gain and unacceptable look. The available implantable hearing devices nowadays are subdivided into two major categories: active middle ear implants (AMEI) and Bone Conduction Hearing Devices (BCHDs) [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR3)]. They differ in indications, design, technique of implantation, as well as aftercare needed for each device [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR5)].\\n\\nBCHDs are classified into passive BCHDs (e.g., BAHA—either connect or attract- or the Ponto device by _Oticon_) and active BCHDs (e.g., Med-EL Bonebridge® [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR7)] and the new Osia® system by _Cochlear Ltd_) [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR9)]_._ These devices are indicated in patients with conductive hearing loss (CHL), mixed hearing loss (MHL) or in single sided deafness (SSD) with stable bone conduction hearing thresholds(BC) within the recommended manufacturer’s range [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. BAHA attract is a passive transcutaneous bone conduction hearing devices (tBCHD) that delivers sound waves to a passive implant magnet across an intact skin barrier whilst Osia®& Bonebridge® are active tBCHDs where the processor transfers acoustic information to the active receiver stimulator package across intact skin which in turn actively recreates the sound signal for transmission by bone conduction [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. BAHA Connect and the Oticon Ponto are percutaneous devices (pBCHDs) which connect to the processor via a skin-penetrating abutment [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10)]. Bilateral BCHD fitting has been recently evaluated and shown promising results including increased ability of sound localization, higher audiological gain as well as enhanced hearing ability in presence of noise [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR12)]. The aim of the work was a broader audiological and surgical comparative evaluation of effectiveness of tBCHDs and pBCHDs in rehabilitation of hearing loss and comparison of bilateral vs unilateral fitting outcomes.\\n\\nMethods\\n-------\\n\\nThis study was a prospective comparative cohort study conducted in the tertiary Regional Department of Otology and Neurotology spanning the period between 1st December 2018 and 30th November 2020. This study was registered with the Clinical Effectiveness Unit (CEU 9334) who also provided the independent review; hence no separate ethical approval was needed. All patient data were anonymised and protected with compliance to Data Protection Act 2018. To be included in our study, patients had to fulfill the following criteria: patients aged 16 years and over with hearing loss (either conductive or mixed type or single sided deafness with normal or near normal BC thresholds of the other side), BC thresholds within BCHD manufacturer’s recommended guidelines, those who have not derived adequate benefit from conventional ACHAs. To be included patients had to have stable bone conduction hearing thresholds (up to 45 dB for Bonebridge® or up to 55 dB for Osia®) within the widely accepted maximal power output of the device. Patients outside the implantation criteria of National Health Services (NHS) Specialised Commissioning Guidelines (2016) were excluded.\\n\\nSeventy-four patients were recruited into our study; patients were allocated into two groups. Four patients dropped out from the study due to different reasons (three patients were lost follow-up and one patient discontinued using the device). The final number of patients included was 70 patients. Group (A) _n_ = 33: Included all patients pBCHD (BAHA connect or Oticon Ponto devices) and Group (B) _n_ = 37: Included all patients with tBCHDs (BAHA attract, Osia®, and Bonebridge® devices). We have also compared the outcome of patients fitted with BCHD bilaterally (15 patients) to patients fitted unilaterally (55 patients).\\n\\nAll patients were reviewed in the BCHD multidisciplinary team clinic employing the pre-operative assessment protocol that included history taking, full examination and audiological evaluation including unaided and aided free field (FF) thresholds and unaided Pure tone average (PTA) mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz as well as adaptive speech recognition in noise and quiet.\\n\\nSuitable candidates were counselled regarding the different types of BCHDs. Choice of the appropriate device depended on multiple factors including patient’s hearing threshold, maximal power output of the devices, indication for implantation, type of hearing loss as well as patient’s own preference. As part of their pre-operative assessment, patients were offered a 14-day trial of a BCHD (on loan) using a soft band to mimic post-operative situation and were asked to record a diary of their trial of the device. An informed consent was signed by the patient prior to surgical procedure. For assessment of patient’s quality of life and comparing it to pre-implantation situation; we have utilized two of the widely accepted questionnaires; the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) and the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire.\\n\\nSurgical procedures were carried out as per manufacturer's guidelines for the selected device. For BAHA Connect device; incision was marked to be 2–3 cm long behind the ear and parallel with hair line, with marking the implant site 1 cm posterior to the planned incision line. Drilling is done using a guide drill and a countersink, followed by placement of the implant and the skin-penetrating abutment. For BAHA attract implant, incision is marked to be 2–3 cm long behind the ear and parallel with hair line, with marking the implant site 1 cm posterior to the planned incision line and planned as inferiorly based C-shaped fashion, an internal magnet is secured to the implanted fixture under the skin and incision is closed in layers. In case of Bonebridge implantation, Incision is made further posterior to the implant site with attention to thickness of the overlying skin flap, followed by drilling a bed for floating mass transducer(FMT) and a periosteal pocket for the attached coil, then the BB is fixed with titanium screws and wound is closed in layers. Patients were reviewed in the outpatient clinic 1 week postoperatively for stitch removal and wound check. Loading, activation, and programming were done during the 4th week of surgery to allow for osseointegration to take place (in case of pBCHDs).\\n\\nOur primary outcome measures included hearing and quality of life assessment (QOL) in the form of aided audiometry (FF thresholds and PTA [Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz]), aided assessment using GHABP and COSI questionnaires. The Secondary outcome measures were skin assessment for complications using Holger’s classification (for tBCHD), comparison of the outcomes of (tBCHDS) vs (pBCHDs) as well as comparison of the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral implantation with BCHDs.\\n\\n### Statistical analysis\\n\\nData analysis was performed using R software version 3.4.4 (R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna). Our figures were generated using the R package “ggplot2”. Categorical outcomes were expressed as counts/frequencies. Meanwhile, the numerical outcomes were presented in the form of mean, standard deviation (SD). Qualitative data were compared via Chi-square (_χ_ 2) test. Pre-operative and postoperative audiometric values were compared using Wilcoxon test. Results with _P_ value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\nResults\\n-------\\n\\nThe mean age of our patients was 53.47 ± 16.59 SD years, and majority of the patients were females (39 cases—45.7%). The commonest hearing loss pattern was mixed hearing loss (MHL) in 58.6% of the overall sample (Fig.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Fig1)). Unilateral implantation was done in 55 cases (78.6%), with tBCHDs as the commonest modality implanted in 52.9%. Preoperative audiological assessment showed a mean of Bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample of 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, while the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) (_P_ = 0.00001) (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Tab1)).\\n\\n### Fig. 1.\\n\\n[![Image 9: Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b2b5/9946869/d8d496582ad6/405_2023_7889_Fig1_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9946869_405_2023_7889_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/figure/Fig1/)\\n\\nTypes of hearing loss of the patients in relation to device type\\n\\n### Table 1.\\n\\nOverall sociodemographic and clinical data\\n\\n| Parameter | Overall |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| _N_ | 70 |\\n| Age (mean (SD)) | 53.47 (16.59) |\\n| Gender |  |\\n| Male | 31 (44.3) |\\n| Female | 39 (45.7) |\\n| Hearing loss type (%) |\\n| CHL | 15 (21.4) |\\n| Mixed | 41 (58.6) |\\n| SSD | 14 (20.0) |\\n| Laterality |  |\\n| Unilateral (%) | 55 (78.6) |\\n| Bilateral (%) | 15(21.4) |\\n| Device (%) |\\n| Transcutaneous | 37 (52.9) |\\n| Percutaneous | 33 (47.1) |\\n| Device type (%) |\\n| BAHA attract | 20 (28.6) |\\n| BAHA connect | 28 (40.0) |\\n| BAHA connect converted to attract | 1 (1.4) |\\n| Bone bridge | 8 (11.4) |\\n| OSIA | 9 (12.9) |\\n| Oticon Ponto | 4 (5.7) |\\n| Pre-op Audiological data |\\n| BC(dB) (mean ± SD) | 23.27 ± 10.91 |\\n| AC(dB) (mean ± SD) | 69.27 ± 13.75 |\\n\\n|  |  | Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test | _P_ value |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| FF speech unaided (%) (mean ± SD) | 88.51 ± 7.92 | _z_ = −6.9588 | < 0.00001 |\\n| FF speech aided (%) (mean ± SD) | 96.79 ± 2.38 |\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/table/Tab1/)\\n\\nThe postoperative GHABP showed a mean benefit score of 70.95 ± 18.79 SD and mean patient satisfaction score of 78.15 ± 18.39 SD.

Such devices improved quality of life (QoL) for a great sector among the hard of hearing community suffering from a wide range of ear conditions causing moderate to severe hearing loss. The pBCHDs were the first to be developed. Despite their drawbacks of skin infection/overgrowth, these devices remain a viable option due to their simplicity and greater audiological gain in comparison to ACHAs and tBCHDs [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR9)].\\n\\nThe tBCHDs were developed to overcome the soft tissue linked drawbacks of percutaneous devices. Such devices are more aesthetically accepted and overcome skin complications occurring due to the skin-penetrating abutment used in pBCHDs. The use of BCHDs is widely approved in health care systems around the developed world. However, they are not widely or uniformly available in developing countries due to its higher cost compared to conventional ACHAs although there is steady growth in availability and uptake [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10)].\\n\\nRecently, bilateral fitting was approved in certain countries including the UK, where it was approved in 2016 [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. Few studies evaluated the effectiveness of such fitting versus unilateral fitting since then. Hence, it is imperative that their effectiveness is evaluated periodically to ensure they are appropriate for hearing impairment.\\n\\nThe outcomes of patients fitted with unilateral (55 patients) and bilateral (15 patients) BCHDs match the expected outcomes in manufacturer's recommendations as well as the NHS commissioning guidelines in the UK [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR12)].\\n\\nThe patient reported pre- and post-fitting GHABP scores consistent improvement in most domains (a benefit score of 70.95 ± 18.79, a satisfaction score of 78.15 ± 18.39, and reduction in the disability score from 54.08 ± 15.26 down to 12.50 ± 10.22 after fitting). These results are in line with many similar studies. One of the earliest was done by Mcdermott et al. in 2002, who compared the conventional ACHA with the BAHA system utilizing both GHABP and GHADP, with a total of 84 adult patients interviewed. Both benefit and satisfaction of patients were significantly better with the use of BAHA compared to ACHAs [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR13)]. Also, Scotta et al. in 2020 compared the GHABP results of BAHA Attract Vs Bonebridge cases. Both groups attained high results in the form of a mean global score of 83 (standard deviation (SD) ± 23.5) in the Bonebridge group and 84 (SD ± 15.3) in the BAHA Attract group [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR14)]. Wazen et al. (2021) assessed the hearing and quality of life outcomes for SSD patients implanted with BAHA retrospectively and showed significant improvement regarding all measures of the GHABP including disability scores, benefit, and satisfaction of their patients [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR15)].\\n\\nAlthough the use of GHABP gives great information aiding to assess the effectiveness of BCHDs, it carries a recall bias as acquiring the information at the follow up stage requires patients to recall the types and degrees of difficulty that they were facing some weeks ago prior to fitting. This carries difficulty, especially for some elderly persons. To overcome this problem, we have asked the patients to fill in the first two columns of the questionnaire prior to surgical interference requesting them to pick their 4 custom situations according to their daily needs, then they were asked to complete the questionnaire one month following fitting.\\n\\nIn the current study, we have also used the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire as a tool for subjective assessment of hearing. The included patients showed significant improvement for all the subscales of COSI questionnaire following fitting with the BCHD as all parameters have improved in 95% of the time for most of the patients. These results are again in line with Scotta et al. who studied the surgical and audiological outcomes of two transcutaneous devices using different outcome measures including the COSI questionnaire. Patients showed improvement in 5 listening situations, including conversation in noise, conversation in quiet places, listening to music, watching TV, and directionality of sound. This improvement was at scales of 75% and 95% of the time in all cases [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR14)].\\n\\nThe audiological outcome of patients using free field speech scores showed significant improvement (_P_< 0.00001) with an aided score of 96.79 ± 2.38 (mean ± SD) compared to an unaided score of 88.51 ± 7.92 preoperatively. All these results are in favor of using the BCHDs as an effective way in the rehabilitation of hearing loss for suitable candidates. These results are supported by many studies published since the early introduction of BCHDs into the market. Dimitriadis et al. (2017) on a study looking at over a hundred patients implanted with BAHA Attract device showed a significant fall in the disability scores of GHABP from 52.4 to 10.6 (_P_< 0.001). The GHABP benefit score was 88.1% and the satisfaction GHABP score was 77.4% [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR16)]. A multi-center study done by Nevoux et al. in 2018 to evaluate the long-term outcomes of BAHA Attract tBCHD system concluded that BAHA Attract implantation results in a significant hearing gain and improved QOL. They favored using this implant due to its reversibility that allows switching to another system if hearing deteriorates over time [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR17)]. Marszal and colleagues (2022) also studied the long-term impact of BAHA Attract on quality of life for their patients using different parameters. They showed a significant improvement, and most patients were satisfied with the aesthetic and usability aspects of the device [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR18)]. On a wider scale, Magele et al. in 2019 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of active tBCHDs. All outcomes reported confirmed significant audiological gain and high patient satisfaction, as well as low complications rate [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR19)].\\n\\nIn our study, we have compared the outcomes of bilateral implantation of BCHDs vs unilateral implantation. Few published studies have discussed benefits of bilateral implantations till date, and the published data still lack convincing evidence to rely on. Patients are often implanted unilaterally on the side of greater hearing loss, or the patient’s preferred ear for those with symmetrical bilateral losses [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR20)]. However, the evidence for the use of bilateral devices is slowly evolving. Initially, they were a controversial issue, as it was felt that one device can stimulate both cochlea and provide an accepted level of amplification to both sides [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR22)]. Despite this, the NHS started commissioning bilateral BCHD implantation in 2016 due to the patient reported benefits. It has been marked however, that the studies on bilateral BCHDs were poor in evidence [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR23)].\\n\\nIn the current study, there was significant difference in favor of bilateral implantation regarding audiological testing including FF speech in both unaided (_P_ = 0.003) and aided (_P_< 0.001) conditions, respectively. The GHABP satisfaction score was significantly higher in bilaterally implanted patients 88.01 ± 12.76 compared to 75.46 ± 18.85 (_P_ = 0.018). Bilaterally implanted patients had significantly worse Initial disability raw score (mean ± SD) = 65.25 ± 14.64 compared to 51.03 ± 14.07 for unilaterally implanted cohort. Results of COSI outcomes showed significant improvement, favoring bilaterally fitted patients with regard to conversation both in quiet situations (_P_ = 0.001) and with groups (_P_ = 0.026). Both groups were similar in situations such as watching TV, conversation in noise and social contact.\\n\\nHilly and colleagues (2020) conducted an interesting study to compare unilateral versus bilateral implantation with regard to hearing in noisy situations. Bilateral amplification was significantly better when signals were presented from the front and noise was presented from both sides. They concluded that bilateral amplification with BCHDs can improve hearing in noise in the binaural implantation [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR24)]. Chin et al. (2021) also demonstrated better hearing threshold, speech reception thresholds in noise and directional hearing with bilateral simultaneous implantation with the tBCHD Bonebridge devices [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR25)]. Similarly, Caspers et al. (2022) studied the efficacy of bilateral implantation with pBCHDs on sound localization [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR26)]. Heath et al. (2021) published a systematic review to assess the outcomes of bilaterally fitted patients. The results of the included studies showed that bilateral BCHDs offer considerable benefit to patients. For the audiological outcomes, improvements were seen in thresholds and understanding speech in quiet and sound localization, as well as restoration of binaural hearing ability. Bilateral BCHDs showed less response in the speech detection in noise. Further advantages of bilateral implantation were found in the QoL results, with all studies reporting overall improvements [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR27)]. Improvements were noted by parents and teachers for those with bilateral losses and bilateral BCHDs compared to unilateral BCHDs [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21)]. These results might support a second implant for eligible cases, However, an assessment of the potential drawbacks such as additional surgical complications and costs, needs to be conducted to justify the risk of this surgery.\\n\\nIn the current study, we have compared the pBCHDs versus the tBCHDs regarding subjective and objective outcomes and skin complications. There was non-significant difference between both categories regarding FF speech in the unaided and aided conditions. Both tBCHDs and pBCHDs showed significant improvement of GHABP disability scores with _P_< 0.0001, with non-significant difference between both categories.\\n\\nPost-operative skin complications were recorded and compared. There was significant difference in favor of transcutaneous devices (_P_ = 0.002) (Fig.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Fig3)). It is well established that percutaneous devices carry the risk of post-operative skin complications ranging from mild redness and erythema up to skin breakdown and skin overgrowth on top of the abutment requiring daily care to avoid such complications. This is due to the nature of the skin-penetrating abutment. Transcutaneous devices have been developed to overcome such a drawback, but percutaneous devices still have its share of the market and still preferred by many surgeons as well as patients; due to its easier surgical procedure and clear audiological gain. The overall reported skin infection/reaction rate in the literature ranged from 1.2 to 52.4% [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR28)].\\n\\nSiau et al. (2012) reported very low skin-related complication rates (1.2%) suggesting that soft tissues above the periosteum, including all the hair follicles, could be excised leaving the periosteum itself intact to reduce such complications [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR29)]. Priwin et al. in 2005 suggested that daily cleaning could help avoid skin infections [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR30)]. The study by Chan et al. in 2017 encouraged minimal soft-tissue reduction, as 60% of their cohort that received full-thickness flaps developed major complications compared to 10% for those with no soft-tissue reduction technique [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR31)]. In our series of patients, we did not resort to perform tissue reduction, which may justify the expected skin complication rate. Godbehere et al. (2017) in a comparative study of complications and initial follow-up costs of transcutaneous and percutaneous bone conduction devices showed that percutaneous group had higher rate of skin complications (20%). with three patients (12%) necessitating removal of the abutment despite treatment with antibiotics compared to, only one patient in the transcutaneous device group having minor skin irritation [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR32)]. In 2021, Hernández et al. published a retrospective study evaluating the long-term cutaneous complications related to tBCHDs spanning the period between 2004 and 2018. Out of the total of patients, 49 (55.7%) developed at least one episode of inflammatory/infectious skin reaction. These rates are higher than most of published skin changes related to tBCHDs in literature. This could be explained by the long follow-up period in their study [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR33)].\\n\\nWhilst still undergoing rapid innovation and refinement, BCHDs are considered a great addition to the audiological armamentarium to improve the quality of life of hard of hearing individuals due to their role in hearing rehabilitation when ACHAs are not effective.\\n\\nOur study was focused on adult patients and was partly limited by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic restricting the number of surgical procedures in the latter part of the study period.\\n\\nIn conclusion, BCHDs are effective in rehabilitation of hearing loss whenever indicated. Both transcutaneous and percutaneous devices showed significant reduction of patients’ disability scores. Postoperative skin complications remain higher in patients fitted with percutaneous devices. Bilateral fitting is favorable where indicated; due to its significant impact on subjective outcomes and improved binaural hearing, sound localization and patient’s self-confidence.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n----------------\\n\\nThe corresponding author would like to express his gratitude to Newton-Mosharafa Fund & the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education, who supported his presence in the UK via a joint supervision mission for PhD studies.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\n--------------------\\n\\nJR: main surgeon and supervisor of the surgical procedures.

This study aimed at evaluating their effectiveness in rehabilitation of hearing loss.\\n\\n**Methods:** This study included patients who received bone conduction implants at Tertiary Teaching Hospitals, between December 2018 and November 2020. Data were collected prospectively, and patients were assessed both subjectively using COSI and GHABP questionnaires and objectively using bone conduction and air conduction thresholds, unaided and aided free field speech thresholds. Outcomes of transcutaneous (tBCHD) and percutaneous (pBCHD) bone conduction hearing devices were compared as well as outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral fitting. Postoperative skin complications were recorded and compared.\\n\\n**Results:** A total of seventy patients were included, thirty-seven of them were implanted with tBCHD and thirty-three with pBCHD. Fifty-five patients were fitted unilaterally compared to 15 bilateral fitting. Preoperative mean of bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample was 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) with P value = 0.00001. The postoperative assessment using GHABP showed a benefit score mean of 70.95 ± 18.79, patient satisfaction score mean of 78.15 ± 18.39. The disability score improved significantly from a mean of 54.08 ± 15.26 to residual score of only 12.50 ± 10.22 with P < 0.00001 postoperatively. There was significant improvement in all parameters of COSI questionnaire following fitting. Comparison of pBCHDs vs tBCHDs showed a non-significant difference regarding FF speech as well as GHABP parameters. Comparison of the post-operative skin complications was in favor of tBCHDs as (86.5%) of the patients had normal skin postoperatively, compared to 45.5% of patients with pBCHDs devices. Bilateral implantation showed significant improvement of FF speech scores, GHABP satisfaction score, as well as COSI score results.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Bone conduction hearing devices are effective solution for rehabilitation of hearing loss. Bilateral fitting yields satisfactory outcomes in suitable candidates. Transcutaneous devices carry significantly lower skin complication rates compared to percutaneous devices.\\n\\n**Keywords:** BAHA; Bone conduction; Deafness; Implantable hearing device; Osia.\\n\\n© 2023.

      "Gather data on non-implant hearing rehabilitation strategies for patients with conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage but intact cochlea and nerve, including bone conduction devices and middle ear implants. Assess comparative effectiveness, patient candidacy overlap, and prognostic indicators to build a holistic recommendation framework.\n",

      "## Hearing Rehabilitation Options for Conductive Hearing Loss with Intact Cochlea and Nerve\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview of Conductive Hearing Loss and Non-Implant Rehabilitation\n",
      "\n",
      "- Conductive hearing loss (CHL) results commonly from ossicular damage or middle ear pathology that impairs mechanical sound transmission, while cochlea and auditory nerve remain intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Non-implant hearing rehabilitation strategies aim to bypass or augment the defective middle ear system, improving sound conduction to the cochlea.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Conventional air conduction hearing aids are often limited in patients with significant ossicular damage or chronic middle ear pathology.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In these cases, bone conduction devices and middle ear implants become important alternatives for rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bone Conduction Devices (BCDs)\n",
      "\n",
      "- BCDs transmit vibrations through the skull bone directly to the cochlea, bypassing the external auditory canal and middle ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Two main types exist: percutaneous devices with an abutment penetrating the skin (e.g., BAHA Connect) and transcutaneous devices that transmit vibrations magnetically through intact skin (e.g., BAHA Attract, Bonebridge, Osia).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Candidacy criteria commonly consider patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, single-sided deafness, and stable bone conduction thresholds within device specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Studies show significant improvement in hearing sensitivity, speech recognition in quiet and noise, and quality of life with BCDs in suitable candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral fitting of BCDs can further enhance sound localization, binaural hearing, and subjective satisfaction compared to unilateral fitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Transcutaneous devices have lower rates of skin complications compared to percutaneous but may offer slightly reduced audiological gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Selection of device type depends on patient anatomy, medical history, aesthetic preferences, and risk of skin complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Long-term outcomes demonstrate substantial benefit with reduced disability scores and high patient satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Middle Ear Implants (MEIs)\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs are implanted devices that mechanically stimulate the middle ear structures (ossicles or cochlea) and can be used in patients with conductive, mixed, and sensorineural hearing loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs bypass the external auditory canal and can be used when air conduction aids are not effective or tolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs generally require intact cochlear function; thus, they are suitable for conductive losses with cochlear nerve integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evidence shows MEIs have comparable safety and effectiveness to bone-anchored hearing aids in improving hearing thresholds and quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs require surgical implantation and are less widely available than BCDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Their use is often considered when patients have mixed hearing losses or inability to use other hearing aids due to anatomical or medical reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparative Effectiveness and Patient Candidacy Overlap\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both BCDs and MEIs are indicated for conductive or mixed hearing loss with intact cochlea and nerve.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comparative studies suggest similar improvements in hearing outcome measures and subjective benefit, though literature is limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "- BCDs are often preferred for conductive losses with stable bone conduction thresholds; MEIs may be selected for mixed losses or when middle ear conditions preclude bone-anchored implants.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral BCD fitting is beneficial but not universally applied; MEI bilateral implantation data are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Optimal device selection depends on audiologic profile, middle ear status, patient preference, surgical risk, and device availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Indicators\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hearing improvement depends on stable cochlear function, absence of active middle ear disease, and appropriate device selection respecting thresholds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Patients with conductive loss due to ossicular damage but intact cochlea have good prognosis with appropriate device rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Duration of hearing loss, patient motivation, cognitive status, and rehabilitation support impact outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral device fitting tends to produce better localization, binaural hearing, and subjective quality of life metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Skin complications are an important consideration in percutaneous BCD users; transcutaneous devices have better skin tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Illustrations and Visuals\n",
      "\n",
      "- Diagrams illustrating hearing loss types including conductive and mixed hearing loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Images showing bone conduction device placement and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Graphics detailing candidacy criteria for bone conduction hearing devices and middle ear implants.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "For patients with conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage but preserved cochlear and auditory nerve function, non-implant hearing rehabilitation encompasses primarily bone conduction devices and middle ear implants as effective options. Bone conduction devices (both percutaneous and transcutaneous types) are widely used and demonstrate significant audiological benefit and improved quality of life. Middle ear implants offer a surgical alternative that also improves hearing in suitable candidates and may particularly benefit mixed hearing loss cases. Device selection depends on auditory thresholds, middle ear status, patient preference, and risk profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilateral fitting of bone conduction devices enhances sound localization and binaural hearing benefits. Transcutaneous bone conduction devices reduce skin-related complications compared to percutaneous devices, though both improve hearing markedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prognosis with non-implant rehabilitation is generally favorable when cochlear integrity is confirmed, and appropriate device candidacy criteria are applied. Multidisciplinary assessment and tailored rehabilitation planning are essential for optimizing functional outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cochlear implant (CI) candidacy now encompasses patients with complex histories including prior tympanoplasties and cholesteatoma, provided the cochlea and auditory nerve remain intact and the middle ear is disease-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prior middle ear surgeries and ossicular chain disruption modify surgical planning, often necessitating staged implantation, subtotal petrosectomy, and obliteration techniques to mitigate infection and implant extrusion risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cochlear implantation can be safely performed simultaneous with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease; however, extensive or recurrent disease requires staged procedures with confirmed eradication prior to implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Electrode insertion in ears post-tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma may require insertion via cochleostomy due to round window ossification or fibrosis; stable fixation of the electrode and obliteration of mastoid cavities ensure implant stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Non-implant hearing rehabilitation such as bone conduction devices (BCDs) and middle ear implants (MEIs) offer alternative or adjunctive options for conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage with preserved cochlear function.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Multidisciplinary evaluation integrating audiological data, imaging, surgical risk, and patient-specific anatomy is imperative for optimal candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochlear implantation represents a transformative intervention for patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss who derive limited benefit from conventional amplification. However, the presence of prior middle ear pathology, including multiple tympanoplasties and cholesteatoma, complicates both candidacy assessment and surgical strategy due to altered anatomy, risk of residual disease, and infection possibility. Though the cochlea and auditory nerve are often preserved in this population, conductive components and ossicular integrity are frequently compromised. This report synthesizes current evidence, clinical guidelines, and surgical considerations to elucidate candidacy criteria, procedural adaptations, risk mitigation strategies, and alternative hearing rehabilitation modalities pertinent to this complex cohort. The objective is to provide a comprehensive knowledge framework facilitating informed clinical decision-making and optimizing patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Cochlear Implant Candidacy in Post-Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Patients\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1.1 General Candidacy Parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "Contemporary cochlear implant candidacy has evolved beyond stringent traditional thresholds to include a broader spectrum of hearing loss profiles. Specific to this cohort:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Audiologic Criteria:** Candidates typically present with severe-to-profound hearing loss; however, the presence of conductive or mixed losses necessitates precise differentiation. For referral consideration, a pure tone average (PTA) ≥ 60 dB HL and speech recognition scores ≤ 50-60% (CNC or AzBio) in the target ear are recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Anatomical Integrity:** High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial for exclusion of active middle ear pathology, assessment of cochlear patency, and confirmation of auditory nerve integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Middle Ear Status:** The ear must be dry and free of infection; active cholesteatoma or residual disease contraindicates immediate implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multidisciplinary Evaluation:** Audiologists, surgeons, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists collaborate to weigh benefits, risks, and patient-specific factors such as duration of deafness, cognitive status, and social support.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1.2 Impact of Prior Surgeries and Ossicular Damage\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ossicular chain disruption leads to conductive or mixed hearing loss but is not an absolute contraindication if the cochlear nerve remains functional.\n",
      "\n",

      "#### 2.1 Timing and Staging Strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Simultaneous Surgery**: Suitable in cases of limited cholesteatoma with intact capsule, employing laser vaporization to ablate residual epithelium and reduce recurrence risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Staged Surgery**: Preferred when disease is extensive or capsule integrity is lost. A first stage involves cholesteatoma removal and cavity obliteration; cochlear implantation follows after confirming disease eradication.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Subtotal Petrosectomy**: This approach obliterates middle ear and mastoid cavities with fat or bone pate, disconnecting the space from the external environment to minimize infection and extrusion risk, especially in radical cavity cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.2 Electrode Insertion Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Round Window Insertion**: Optimal when patent; however, frequently compromised by fibrosis or ossification post-infection or prior surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cochleostomy**: Employed if the round window is not accessible, requiring precise anatomical navigation due to altered middle ear structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Array Fixation and Stabilization**: Critical due to altered cavity morphology; fixation near the surface reduces risk of extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.3 Risk Mitigation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Infection Control**: Perioperative antibiotics and obliteration reduce implant-related infection risk, skin flap breakdown, and meningitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monitoring for Residual/Recurrent Disease**: Regular postoperative imaging and clinical examinations are imperative.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature, including recent clinical guidelines from the American Cochlear Implant Alliance and otolaryngology expert consensus, converges on expanded CI candidacy criteria that emphasize individualized assessment rather than rigid audiometric cutoffs. Middle ear pathology, including cholesteatoma and prior tympanoplasties, historically represented contraindications, but emerging evidence supports safe implantation under strict disease-free conditions. Surgical techniques have adapted to the altered anatomy, reflecting evolving understanding of disease management, implant mechanics, and infection control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology & Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Data synthesis involves appraisal of cohort studies, retrospective analyses, surgical series, and case reports to compare outcomes between early and staged implantation, obliterative vs. non-obliterative tympanoplasty, and alternative hearing devices for conductive losses. Imaging modalities serve as diagnostic cornerstones. Outcomes are assessed by standardized speech recognition tests and quality of life surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "While cochlear implantation in this population achieves generally favorable outcomes, risks of residual cholesteatoma and infection necessitate meticulous surgical planning and vigilant postoperative surveillance. Obliteration techniques, although more technically demanding, reduce long-term complications. Alternative devices offer rehabilitation for patients not suited or electing not to undergo implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include heterogeneous reporting of outcomes, small case numbers in complex surgical subgroups, and variable follow-up durations. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials remain needed to further refine intervention algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Research Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prospective multi-institutional registries assessing long-term outcomes and complications in cholesteatoma-treated ears receiving CI.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comparative effectiveness of simultaneous vs. staged cochlear implantation relative to disease extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Innovations in electrode design and fixation tailored to obliterated mastoid anatomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expanded trials on middle ear implants and bone conduction devices in complex ossicular disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Improved imaging protocols for early detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma post-implantation.\n",
