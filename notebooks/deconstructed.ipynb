Because of the COVID-19 crisis, companies had to rely on remote and hybrid ways of working and so moved to online collaboration and data tools to ensure they stayed productive. Because of cloud services, employees can work with data and tools from any location, helping the business continue smoothly. Modern workplaces rely on cloud tools because they support simultaneous collaboration, secure document sharing, and flexible and scalable file storage.\\n\\nRecently, the U.S. Census Bureau found that over 37% of employees work online or remotely at least some of the time. Because remote work has become more common, companies are looking for cloud solutions to ensure they can connect, protect their data, and stay flexible. So, because companies need technology for remote and digital coordination, the market for cloud solutions is also getting bigger.\\n\\n### **_Data security and privacy concerns limit cloud adoption in sensitive industries and regions._**\\n\\nSecurity and privacy worries still hinder the growth of the Cloud Computing Market. Because more organisations move their confidential data and main applications to the cloud, worries about hackers, data breaches, and unauthorised access have become more severe. A lot of industries dealing with private information in healthcare, banking, and government tend to hesitate to use cloud solutions because of the risks. Dealing with regulations in various regions and the fear that their data might not be kept safe leads to more uncertainty about adopting the cloud.\\n\\nDue to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, some cloud providers still have difficulties managing and protecting data according to every required standard in every country. Because of these concerns, businesses are reluctant, which slows down the progress and popularity of cloud services. There are also restrictions in many countries that control where and how data can be stored or moved, which impacts the operations of cloud service providers managing data from various places. Security measures such as encryption, identity management, and threat detection are constantly being strengthened in the cloud industry to manage security concerns.\\n\\n### **_Integration of AI and machine learning with cloud platforms enables advanced analytics capabilities._**\\n\\nCombining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud platforms represents an important opportunity in the Cloud Computing Market. By working together, businesses now use advanced analytics and automation to convert huge amounts of data into useful information. Such cloud-based solutions are the reason complex AI and ML can work without the high initial purchase of hardware. As a consequence, companies can quicken their innovative efforts, enhance how they make managerial choices, and perform better when it comes to operations across healthcare, finance, and retail.\\n\\nIn the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report, it was revealed that AI in cloud services has increased by 45% over the last three years, revealing a strong desire to use these technologies together. Cloud platforms supplying AI-powered analytics as a service are a major reason for the market’s growth, reaching small as well as large enterprises. Because of this trend, more customers want a personal customer experience, automated maintenance, and advanced cybersecurity tools, all based in the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\n### **_Expansion of edge computing enhances real-time processing and reduces latency in cloud services._**\\n\\nThe rise of edge computing in the Cloud Computing Market can make real-time processing faster and help cut down cloud service delays. Edge computing deals with processing data at the place where it is collected. Because of this design, information is sent faster, making this method important for self-driving cars, smart cities, and the automated industry. Hybrid solutions that blend cloud computing with fast local action are made possible by edge computing, and these help the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\nAccording to a report from the University of California, Berkeley, using edge computing for cloud services could lower the latency experience by half, which will improve the experience for users and make operations more efficient. It is essential now that 5G networks are growing since they let cloud and edge resources blend seamlessly. Because of edge computing, the cloud industry will be able to support more data-heavy and quick-response applications, encouraging the use of these applications in many sectors.\\n\\n**Segment Analysis**\\n--------------------\\n\\nBased on the product type, the Cloud Computing Market has been classified into Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service.

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, companies had to rely on remote and hybrid ways of working and so moved to online collaboration and data tools to ensure they stayed productive. Because of cloud services, employees can work with data and tools from any location, helping the business continue smoothly. Modern workplaces rely on cloud tools because they support simultaneous collaboration, secure document sharing, and flexible and scalable file storage.\\n\\nRecently, the U.S. Census Bureau found that over 37% of employees work online or remotely at least some of the time. Because remote work has become more common, companies are looking for cloud solutions to ensure they can connect, protect their data, and stay flexible. So, because companies need technology for remote and digital coordination, the market for cloud solutions is also getting bigger.\\n\\n### **_Data security and privacy concerns limit cloud adoption in sensitive industries and regions._**\\n\\nSecurity and privacy worries still hinder the growth of the Cloud Computing Market. Because more organisations move their confidential data and main applications to the cloud, worries about hackers, data breaches, and unauthorised access have become more severe. A lot of industries dealing with private information in healthcare, banking, and government tend to hesitate to use cloud solutions because of the risks. Dealing with regulations in various regions and the fear that their data might not be kept safe leads to more uncertainty about adopting the cloud.\\n\\nDue to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, some cloud providers still have difficulties managing and protecting data according to every required standard in every country. Because of these concerns, businesses are reluctant, which slows down the progress and popularity of cloud services. There are also restrictions in many countries that control where and how data can be stored or moved, which impacts the operations of cloud service providers managing data from various places. Security measures such as encryption, identity management, and threat detection are constantly being strengthened in the cloud industry to manage security concerns.\\n\\n### **_Integration of AI and machine learning with cloud platforms enables advanced analytics capabilities._**\\n\\nCombining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud platforms represents an important opportunity in the Cloud Computing Market. By working together, businesses now use advanced analytics and automation to convert huge amounts of data into useful information. Such cloud-based solutions are the reason complex AI and ML can work without the high initial purchase of hardware. As a consequence, companies can quicken their innovative efforts, enhance how they make managerial choices, and perform better when it comes to operations across healthcare, finance, and retail.\\n\\nIn the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report, it was revealed that AI in cloud services has increased by 45% over the last three years, revealing a strong desire to use these technologies together. Cloud platforms supplying AI-powered analytics as a service are a major reason for the market’s growth, reaching small as well as large enterprises. Because of this trend, more customers want a personal customer experience, automated maintenance, and advanced cybersecurity tools, all based in the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\n### **_Expansion of edge computing enhances real-time processing and reduces latency in cloud services._**\\n\\nThe rise of edge computing in the Cloud Computing Market can make real-time processing faster and help cut down cloud service delays. Edge computing deals with processing data at the place where it is collected. Because of this design, information is sent faster, making this method important for self-driving cars, smart cities, and the automated industry. Hybrid solutions that blend cloud computing with fast local action are made possible by edge computing, and these help the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\nAccording to a report from the University of California, Berkeley, using edge computing for cloud services could lower the latency experience by half, which will improve the experience for users and make operations more efficient. It is essential now that 5G networks are growing since they let cloud and edge resources blend seamlessly. Because of edge computing, the cloud industry will be able to support more data-heavy and quick-response applications, encouraging the use of these applications in many sectors.\\n\\n**Segment Analysis**\\n--------------------\\n\\nBased on the product type, the Cloud Computing Market has been classified into Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service.

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, companies had to rely on remote and hybrid ways of working and so moved to online collaboration and data tools to ensure they stayed productive. Because of cloud services, employees can work with data and tools from any location, helping the business continue smoothly. Modern workplaces rely on cloud tools because they support simultaneous collaboration, secure document sharing, and flexible and scalable file storage.\\n\\nRecently, the U.S. Census Bureau found that over 37% of employees work online or remotely at least some of the time. Because remote work has become more common, companies are looking for cloud solutions to ensure they can connect, protect their data, and stay flexible. So, because companies need technology for remote and digital coordination, the market for cloud solutions is also getting bigger.\\n\\n### **_Data security and privacy concerns limit cloud adoption in sensitive industries and regions._**\\n\\nSecurity and privacy worries still hinder the growth of the Cloud Computing Market. Because more organisations move their confidential data and main applications to the cloud, worries about hackers, data breaches, and unauthorised access have become more severe. A lot of industries dealing with private information in healthcare, banking, and government tend to hesitate to use cloud solutions because of the risks. Dealing with regulations in various regions and the fear that their data might not be kept safe leads to more uncertainty about adopting the cloud.\\n\\nDue to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, some cloud providers still have difficulties managing and protecting data according to every required standard in every country. Because of these concerns, businesses are reluctant, which slows down the progress and popularity of cloud services. There are also restrictions in many countries that control where and how data can be stored or moved, which impacts the operations of cloud service providers managing data from various places. Security measures such as encryption, identity management, and threat detection are constantly being strengthened in the cloud industry to manage security concerns.\\n\\n### **_Integration of AI and machine learning with cloud platforms enables advanced analytics capabilities._**\\n\\nCombining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud platforms represents an important opportunity in the Cloud Computing Market. By working together, businesses now use advanced analytics and automation to convert huge amounts of data into useful information. Such cloud-based solutions are the reason complex AI and ML can work without the high initial purchase of hardware. As a consequence, companies can quicken their innovative efforts, enhance how they make managerial choices, and perform better when it comes to operations across healthcare, finance, and retail.\\n\\nIn the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report, it was revealed that AI in cloud services has increased by 45% over the last three years, revealing a strong desire to use these technologies together. Cloud platforms supplying AI-powered analytics as a service are a major reason for the market’s growth, reaching small as well as large enterprises. Because of this trend, more customers want a personal customer experience, automated maintenance, and advanced cybersecurity tools, all based in the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\n### **_Expansion of edge computing enhances real-time processing and reduces latency in cloud services._**\\n\\nThe rise of edge computing in the Cloud Computing Market can make real-time processing faster and help cut down cloud service delays. Edge computing deals with processing data at the place where it is collected. Because of this design, information is sent faster, making this method important for self-driving cars, smart cities, and the automated industry. Hybrid solutions that blend cloud computing with fast local action are made possible by edge computing, and these help the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\nAccording to a report from the University of California, Berkeley, using edge computing for cloud services could lower the latency experience by half, which will improve the experience for users and make operations more efficient. It is essential now that 5G networks are growing since they let cloud and edge resources blend seamlessly. Because of edge computing, the cloud industry will be able to support more data-heavy and quick-response applications, encouraging the use of these applications in many sectors.\\n\\n**Segment Analysis**\\n--------------------\\n\\nBased on the product type, the Cloud Computing Market has been classified into Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service.

The rise of Gen AI is reshaping priorities in the IT market, with server sales driving growth as businesses ramp up investments in data center systems to support expanding use cases.\\n\\nMarketsandMarkets anticipates that the global cloud market size will grow from USD 1,091.4 billion in 2024 to USD 1,256.8 billion by 2025 – up 15.1% year-over-year. The integration of gen AI with the cloud, the growing adoption of industry-specific cloud solutions, the rise of cloud-native technologies, intensifying competition among cloud providers, and the shift toward multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies are fueling cloud market growth.\\n\\n![Image 3: Global Cloud Industry Outlook 2025](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Images/cloud-industry-outlook.webp)\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n#### 2024\\n\\n*   Cloud Transforms Customer Engagement– BFSI companies are using cloud technologies to improve operations and customize services, boosting customer interaction. For instance, Kotak Mahindra Bank employs Salesforce to integrate sales, service, and loan approval workflows, allowing fast loan disbursals and smooth omnichannel experiences for 43.5 million customers.\\n*   Cloud Investments Drive Economic Growth in APAC and EMEA– Google Cloud, Oracle, Microsoft and AWS are expanding in regions like Germany, France, Singapore, KSA, India, Qatar, and Southeast Asia, fostering digital transformation.\\n*   Gen AI Revolutionizes Cloud Applications– The integration of Generative AI into cloud platforms by AWS, Microsoft, and Google is enabling businesses to deploy advanced AI-driven applications for personalized customer experiences, predictive analytics, and operational efficiency.\\n\\n#### 2025\\n\\n*   Industry Cloud Solutions Lead the Charge– Industry-specific cloud solutions will grow, with North America and Europe driving the adoption of tailored cloud environments across sectors.\\n*   Increased Adoption of Multi-cloud Strategies– Organizations are adopting multi-cloud environments to avoid vendor lock-in, improve flexibility, and optimize performance across different cloud platforms.\\n*   AI Integration Drives Cloud Innovation– Cloud platforms will further integrate AI technologies, improving efficiency, decision-making, and new service models across industries.\\n\\n### TOP GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES:\\n\\n*    The BFSI sector will use cloud platforms to enhance fraud prevention, ensure compliance, and enable real-time analytics.\\n*    Manufacturing will adopt cloud solutions for IoT-enabled production processes and predictive maintenance in smart factories.\\n*    The healthcare sector will experience increased cloud utilization for electronic health records and AI-based diagnostics to enhance patient results.\\n*    Use cases such as Cloud ERP, ECM, LMS, and System Infrastructure Software will witness higher spending growth. \\n\\nWe have analyzed the key trends in our Global Cloud Industry Outlook 2024 project that can help cloud professionals and business leaders prepare investments for the coming year.\\n\\n### Key Questions Addressed by the Report\\n\\n How did Trump tariffs influence cloud service providers' operational costs?\\n\\n The tariffs increased costs for hardware components, including servers and networking equipment, which are critical for cloud infrastructure. Providers faced higher expenses in data center expansions and upgrades, leading to tighter margins. Some companies absorbed these costs, while others adjusted pricing models, creating competitive pressures in the cloud services market.\\n\\n What are the opportunities in the global Supply Chain Security market?\\n\\n While some enterprises expedited cloud migration to offset rising IT infrastructure costs, others delayed investments due to economic uncertainty. The tariffs created hesitation in long-term IT spending, particularly for businesses reliant on imported hardware. However, the flexibility of cloud solutions helped many organizations adapt without heavy upfront capital expenditures.\\n\\n How did the tariffs affect global data center expansion strategies?\\n\\n Cloud providers reassessed supply chain risks and diversified hardware sourcing to minimize tariff-related disruptions.

This industry plays a crucial role in improving operations, efficiency, and financial performance for various business sectors. It includes a broad array of cloud offerings, such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), all designed to enhance effectiveness and scalability while ensuring data protection and accessibility.\\n\\nThe growing need for adaptable and economical IT solutions has prompted a transition from conventional on-site systems to cloud-based services, boosting efficiency and reducing operational expenses. This transition reduces the necessity for substantial physical hardware and upkeep, enabling companies to adjust their operations flexibly. Additionally, the rising demand for data-driven insights and high-quality digital services encourages organizations to embrace cloud computing solutions, which aid in maintaining operational consistency and compliance with regulations.\\n\\nVarious firms are investing into the cloud computing sector, creating numerous opportunities; for example, in October 2023, Microsoft revealed a A$5 billion investment in computing capacity and capability to aid Australia in harnessing the AI era. However, the escalating costs of cloud services and potential security risks present challenges, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Despite these obstacles, the market is experiencing remarkable growth due to opportunities for innovation and the emergence of advanced technologies, including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nThese advancements provide further opportunities for predictive analytics, improved security measures, and better decision-making abilities, suggesting that the global cloud computing market would grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period.\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/content-images/2348/2348986/1/cloud-computing.png)[](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/11/3097849/28124/en/Cloud-Computing-Market-Forecast-Report-2025-2035-Global-Cloud-Computing-Market-Forecasted-to-Reach-3-50-Trillion-by-2035.html# \\\"Expand\\\")\\n\\n**CLOUD COMPUTING MARKET: KEY SEGMENTS**\\n\\n**Market Share by Type of Deployment Model**\\n\\nBased on the type of deployment model, the global cloud computing market is segmented into public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud deployment models.

But behind all of this smart technology is something that often gets overlooked: the hardware that makes it all possible. Traditional CPUs are great for general tasks, but they struggle with the massive, complex calculations needed for deep learning. As AI models have gotten bigger and more powerful, we’ve needed hardware that can keep up. That’s where GPUs and TPUs come in.\\n\\n![blog-image](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/Mastering_AWS_Transit_Gateway_Architecture_Use_Cases_and_Best_Practices_bfabe97b32.jpg)\\n\\n### Mastering AWS Transit Gateway: Architecture, Use Cases & Best Practices\\n\\nAWS Transit Gateway is a highly scalable and flexible service that simplifies network architectures by providing centralized connectivity for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks and on-premises networks.

Microsoft has consistently increased its cloud customer base and total cloud revenue quarter after quarter.\\n\\nAzure sales are reported inside Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud group that also includes the company’s server products and other non-Azure cloud services.\\n\\nFor Q4 2024, Microsoft Intelligent Cloud business generated $25.5 billion in total sales, up 19 percent year over year. This represents a $102 billion annual run rate. Operating income for Microsoft Intelligent Cloud group was $10.8 billion, up 14 percent year over year.\\n\\n(It is key to note that starting in 2024, Synergy changed the way that Microsoft Azure revenues were categorized with some Azure revenue restated as Software as-a-Service (SaaS) rather than IaaS or PaaS.
