Crude oil prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, driven by rising global oil inventories that have resulted from slowing global oil demand growth and the accelerated unwinding of OPEC+ voluntary production cuts, which began in April. On May 31, OPEC+ members agreed to a third month of [planned production increases](https://www.opec.org/pr-detail/1360566-31-may-2025.html) in July, with the potential for revisions pending market conditions. These factors contribute to our expectation that global oil production will exceed consumption over the forecast period, causing global oil inventories to build and putting downward pressure on oil prices. We expect Brent crude oil prices will average $66/b this year and $59/b next year.\\n\\n[![Image 2: Brent crude oil spot price and global inventory changes](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_01.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_01.png)\\n\\nGlobal oil inventories increased over the first five months of 2025 and will continue to grow significantly over the forecast period. We expect they will increase by an average of 0.4 million barrels per day (b/d) for the remainder of the year. We expect global oil inventory builds will average 0.8 million b/d in 2025, 0.4 million b/d higher than in last month’s STEO. For the second half of the year, we expect that slowing global oil production growth—led by relatively flat U.S. crude oil production—and rising oil consumption growth mean builds will moderate to 0.6 million b/d next year, with markets moving towards balance.\\n\\nGlobal inventory builds in 2025 are higher in this month’s STEO than last due to a combination of lower oil demand in the OECD in 2025 and increased supply growth from both OPEC+ countries and from countries outside of the group. Although the recent OPEC+ announcement added near-term supply to oil balances in our forecast, we made additional upward revisions to our Kazakhstan production forecast to accurately account for recent production levels from the Tengiz field. We also revised our forecast for Brazil because the Bacalhau Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) vessel is set to begin earlier than we had previously assumed in our forecast.\\n\\nSignificant uncertainty remains in our price forecast. Although we do not currently forecast any major supply disruptions, oil supply risks remain. [Wildfires around Canada’s major oil sands facilities](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albertas-wildfires-disrupt-some-7-canadas-oil-production-2025-06-02/) in Alberta, elevated tensions in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well a [potential force majeure on oil exports in Libya](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/libyas-eastern-based-government-says-it-may-announce-force-majeure-oil-fields-2025-05-28/) have the potential to disrupt supply. Another source of uncertainty is the willingness and ability of OPEC+ members to coordinate future production targets in the face of falling oil prices and increasing oil supply from sources outside of OPEC+.\\n\\nIn addition, uncertainty around the status of ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and its trading partners could greatly affect oil prices. The status of sanctions on Russia and Iran remains uncertain, as does future development around Venezuelan oil assets, which have the potential to influence trade flows and affect oil prices.\\n\\n**Global oil production and consumption**\\n\\n Oil consumption growth in our forecast continues to be less than the pre-pandemic trend. Forecast global liquid fuels consumption increases by 0.8 million b/d in 2025 and 1.1 million b/d in 2026, driven primarily by demand from non-OECD countries. Total non-OECD consumption grows by 0.9 million b/d in 2025 and 1.0 million b/d in 2026, while OECD consumption is largely unchanged over the forecast.\\n\\n[![Image 3: annual change in world liquid fuels consumption](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_02.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_02.png)\\n\\nWe expect India will increase its consumption of liquid fuels by 0.2 million b/d in 2025 and 0.3 million b/d in 2026, compared with an increase of 0.2 million in 2024, driven by rising demand for transportation fuels. We forecast China’s liquid fuels consumption will grow by 0.2 million b/d in both 2025 and 2026, up from an increase of 0.1 million b/d in 2024.\\n\\nThe planned increases to OPEC+ production combined with supply growth outside of the group continue to drive strong global liquid fuels production growth in our forecast. Global liquid fuels production increases by 1.6 million b/d in 2025, 0.2 million b/d higher than in last month’s STEO, before increasing by 0.8 million b/d in 2026.\\n\\n[![Image 4: OPEC+ crude oil production and targets](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_03.png)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/images/TextFigures/TextFig_03.png)\\n\\nAlthough OPEC+ recently announced its third consecutive planned monthly crude oil production increase for July 2025, we still anticipate OPEC+ members will produce below the current target path to limit increases in global oil inventories and attempt to support falling prices. We expect OPEC+ will increase its crude oil production by 0.3 million b/d this year, compared with a decrease of 1.4 million b/d in 2024, before increasing by 0.5 million b/d in 2026.\\n\\nWe expect countries outside of OPEC+ will drive global liquid fuels production growth this year, increasing production by 1.1 million b/d. However, OPEC+ drives growth next year in our forecast, as Non-OPEC+ growth in our forecast slows to 0.2 million b/d, with growth from Brazil, Guyana, and Canada being partly offset by a slight drop in U.S. production.\\n\\n| Global Petroleum and Other Liquids |\\n| --- |\\n|  | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 projected | 2026 projected |\\n| Note: Values in this table are rounded and may not match values in other tables in this report. |\\n| Brent crude oil spot price (dollars per barrel) | 82 | 81 | 66 | 59 |\\n| Global liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 102.2 | 102.8 | 104.4 | 105.1 |\\n| OPEC liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 32.4 | 32.4 | 32.7 | 32.9 |\\n| Non-OPEC liquid fuels production (million barrels per day) | 69.8 | 70.4 | 71.6 | 72.2 |\\n| Global liquid fuels consumption (million barrels per day) | 101.8 | 102.7 | 103.5 | 104.6 |\\n| Global GDP (percentage change) | 3.4 | 3.2 | 2.8 | 2.9 |\\n\\n#### Interactive Data Viewers\\n\\n_Provides custom data views of historical and forecast data_\\n\\n**[STEO Data browser ›](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/)\\n\\n[Real Prices Viewer ›](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/realprices/)**\\n\\n| Related Tables |\\n| --- |\\n| [Table 2.

The agency expects global oil demand growth will come nearly to a halt in the coming years with Chinese consumption set to slow down after an initial pent-up recovery. IEA is forecasting that China’s “pent-up” oil consumption will [peak mid-2023 after a 1.5 million-barrels-per-day rebound](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) but lose momentum to just an average of 290,000 barrels per day year-on-year from 2024 to 2028. Annual global demand growth is forecast to decline from [2.4 million barrels per day this year to 400,000 barrels per day in 2028](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html). The shift is occurring, according to IEA, because of the “clean energy transition” as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance. This IEA forecast updates its prediction in October that oil demand [would plateau by the mid-2030s](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html).\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**Fast Facts**\\n\\n*   IEA predicts that peak oil will occur in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day, 6 percent higher than last year’s demand, moving the peak date up from the mid-2030s in its earlier forecast.\\n*   IEA points to the “green energy transition” as the cause of oil demand plateauing—a concept it has been cheerleading on behalf of OECD governments.\\n*   IEA assumes that electric vehicles will represent one out of four vehicles by 2028 world-wide. \\n*   IEA predicts an 11 percent increase in investment in new oil exploration and production this year, which illustrates a gulf between IEA and those in the oil business. \\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.48.31-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.48.31-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\nThe adoption of tighter efficiency standards by government regulators, structural changes to the economy and the increasing penetration of electric vehicles are expected to moderate annual growth in oil demand throughout the forecast. The IEA assumes more than one in four cars in 2028 will be an electric vehicle, with sales near [25.9 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html). The use of gasoline for vehicles is expected to decline after 2026, given increased adoption of electric vehicles, biofuel mandates and improving fuel economy.\\n\\n[Non-OECD Asia leads oil demand growth](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf) in IEA’s forecast between 2022 and 2028. China has strong gains at the start of the forecast, but India overtakes China beginning in 2027. The OECD demand growth declines beginning in 2024.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.52.31-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.52.31-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\n**Oil Supply**\\n\\nOn the supply side, the IEA expects oil producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — known as OPEC+ — to “[dominate medium-term capacity expansion plans](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html),” including the United States, Brazil and Guyana. Global supply capacity is expected to increase by [5.9 million barrels per day to 111 million barrels per day by 2028](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html), and result in a spare capacity cushion of [3.8 million barrels per day](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028), mainly concentrated in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\nRussian output remains “clouded,” with the IEA predicting declines as a result of sanctions on Moscow’s seaborne oil and petroleum products exports since the end of last year, along with the departure of Western companies that facilitated production. The IEA expects Russian supplies to ease by a [net 710,000 barrels per day](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) for the six-year forecast period to 2028.\\n\\n**Refining**\\n\\nIn the refining sector, [global capacity has been reduced by](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028) facility closures, conversions to biofuel plants and project delays since the pandemic. This reduction combined with a drop in Chinese oil product exports and an upheaval of Russian trade flows, resulted in record profits for the industry last year. IEA expects global refinery capacity to expand by [4.4 million barrels per day](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf) over the six-year period, with a 6 million barrels per day increase offset by planned closures.  IEA warns that while the amount of net refinery capacity additions by 2028 is expected to outpace demand growth for refined products, diverging trends among products could result in a repeat of the 2022 tightness in middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel.\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.53.52-PM.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.53.52-PM.png)\\n\\n[Source: International Energy Agency](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24ac96e5-177b-425e-a268-d93fdabec2d3/OIL23-Launch.pdf)\\n\\n**Investment**\\n\\nIEA predicts that ongoing upstream oil investment will reach its highest level since 2015 at [$528 billion in 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/iea-global-oil-demand-to-peak-before-the-end-of-the-decade.html) (11 percent increase), surpassing the amount that would be needed in a world that gets on track for net zero carbon emissions. Shell recently announced that it planned to keep its oil output steady until 2030, revising an earlier plan to cut production by between [1 percent and 2 percent a year](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html) over that period. BP announced earlier this year that it would scale back its targets to cut production, slashing oil output by [25 percent](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/energy/global-oil-demand-peak-this-decade/index.html) by 2030 from 2019 levels, where it previously planned to cut output by 40 percent. Both Shell and BP, however, still say that they plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\n\\n[IEA notes](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028) a number of factors that could affect market balances over the medium term – including uncertain global economic trends, the direction of OPEC+ decisions and China’s refining industry policy.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIEA sees the global oil market growing through 2028, where it is expected to peak due to the “clean energy transition” to electric vehicles, biofuels and improved vehicle efficiency. Oil supply growth is expected mainly in the United States, Brazil and Guyana with a spare capacity cushion in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For supply growth, investment must continue and IEA is forecasting an 11 percent increase year over year, reaching its highest level since 2015. The agency cautions that a number of issues could affect the market balances it is projecting.\\n\\n[![Image 7: Print Friendly, PDF & Email](https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-button.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028/# \\\"Printer Friendly, PDF & Email\\\")\\n\\n[See More Articles By This Expert](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/about/ier-site-manager/articles)\\n\\n### Tags\\n\\n[Domestic Energy Production,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/domestic-energy-production/)\\n\\n[energy production,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/energy-production/)\\n\\n[global energy issues,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/global-energy-issues/)\\n\\n[global energy markets,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/global-energy-markets/)\\n\\n[IEA,](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/iea/)\\n\\n[oil production](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/tag/oil-production/)\\n\\n##### June 2023\\n\\nBiden’s Energy Grid Not Prepared for the Onslaught of Electric Vehicles\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/uncategorized/bidens-energy-grid-not-prepared-for-the-onslaught-of-electric-vehicles/)\\n\\n##### June 2023\\n\\nChina Will Burn More Coal As It Supplies “Green Energy” Technologies to the World\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/climate-change/china-will-burn-more-coal-as-it-supplies-green-energy-technologies-to-the-world/)\\n\\nStay in Touch\\n\\n*   Enter your email address\\\\*\\n    \\n*   CAPTCHA\\n    \\n\\n          \\n\\n[![Image 8](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/themes/ier2017/assets/images/logo_footer.png)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/)\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/instituteforenergyresearch)[](https://twitter.com/IERenergy)[](https://www.youtube.com/user/IERDC)\\n\\n*   [Contact](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/contact/)\\n*   [Privacy Policy](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/privacy-policy/)\\n*   [RSS Feeds](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/feed)\\n\\n![Image 9](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/themes/ier2017/assets/images/search_footer.png)\\n\\n[](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n![Image 10](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/logo.png)\\n\\n \\n\\nDon’t miss out on the latest news updates from IER’s team of energy experts.\\n\\n \\n\\nGet Updates From IER\\n\\nX\\n\\n         Notifications\\n\\n![Image 11: notification icon](https://img.onesignal.com/permanent/eec453fb-878c-435a-8919-7d21e7c3a15c/WufLNW6OSgiXWtCBQxWA_IER_Logo_Mark_Color_RGB%20copy.png)\\n\\nWe'd like to show you notifications for the latest news and updates.\\n\\nAllowCancel\\n\"\n",

Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/reuters-power-up/?location=article-paragraph)\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\n\\\"Future energy demand is found in the developing world due to increasing populations, middle class and urbanization,\\\" said OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais during the report's launch in Brazil, a country with which the group is seeking to form [closer ties](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-looking-forward-working-with-brazil-secretary-general-says-2024-09-23/).\\n\\nAl Ghais' speech in Rio de Janeiro was briefly disturbed by a protester from Greenpeace.\\n\\nA longer period of rising consumption would be a boost for OPEC, whose 12 members depend on oil income. In support of its view, OPEC said it expected more push back on \\\"ambitious\\\" clean energy targets, and cited plans by several global carmakers to [scale down](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/carmakers-adjust-electrification-plans-ev-demand-slows-2024-09-06/) electrification goals.\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\n\\\"There is no peak oil demand on the horizon,\\\" Al Ghais wrote in the foreword to the report.\\n\\n\\\"Over the past year, there has been further recognition that the world can only phase in new energy sources at scale when they are genuinely ready.\\\"\\n\\nOPEC expects world oil demand to reach 118.9 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2045, around 2.9 million bpd higher than expected in last year's report. The report rolled out its timeline to 2050 and expects demand to hit 120.1 million bpd by then.\\n\\nThat is far above other 2050 forecasts from the industry. BP projects oil use will peak in 2025 and decline to 75 million bpd in 2050. [Exxon Mobil](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-forecasts-2050-oil-demand-match-todays-25-above-bp-estimate-2024-08-26/) [(XOM.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/XOM.N) expects oil demand to stay above 100 million bpd through 2050, similar to today's level.\\n\\nOPEC has been calling for more oil industry investment and said the sector needs $17.4 trillion to be spent to 2050, compared with $14 trillion needed by 2045 estimated last year.\\n\\n\\\"All policymakers and stakeholders need to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate,\\\" Al Ghais wrote.\\n\\nHIGHER 2029 FORECAST THAN IEA\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nOPEC also raised its medium term demand forecasts, citing a stronger economic backdrop than last year as inflation pressure wanes and central banks start to lower interest rates.\\n\\nWorld demand in 2028 will reach 111 million bpd, OPEC said, and 112.3 million bpd in 2029. The 2028 figure is up 800,000 bpd from last year's prediction.\\n\\nOPEC's 2029 forecast is more than 6 million bpd higher than that of the IEA, which said in June demand will plateau in 2029 at 105.6 million bpd. The gap is larger than the combined output of OPEC members Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nIn 2020, OPEC made a shift when the pandemic hit oil demand, saying consumption would plateau in the late 2030s. It has begun raising forecasts again as oil use has recovered.\\n\\nBy 2050, there will be 2.9 billion vehicles on the road, up 1.2 billion from 2023, OPEC forecast. Despite electric vehicle growth, vehicles powered by a combustion engine will account for more than 70% of the global fleet in 2050, the report said.\\n\\n\\\"Electric vehicles are poised for a larger market share, but obstacles remain, such as electricity grids, battery manufacturing capacity and access to critical minerals,\\\" it said.\\n\\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, are cutting supply to support the market. The report sees OPEC+'s share of the oil market rising to 52% in 2050 from 49% in 2023 as U.S. output peaks in 2030 and non-OPEC+ output does so in the early 2030s.\\n\\nReporting by Alex Lawler in

Following the commitment of its member governments to the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accords, the agency radically changed its mission to become a promoter of an energy transition. In 2022, the IEA’s governing board reinforced its mission to “guide countries as they build net-zero emission energy systems to comply with internationally agreed climate goals.”\\n\\nThe IEA’s current preoccupation with promoting an energy transition has resulted in its signature annual report, the World Energy Outlook (WEO), offering policymakers a view of future possibilities that are, at best, distorted and, at worst, dangerously wrong.\\n\\nThe 2024 WEO’s central conclusion, its core “outlook,” has been widely reported as a credible *forecast*, i.e., something *likely* to happen: “[T]he continued progress of transitions means that, by the end of the decade, the global economy can continue to grow without using additional amounts of oil, natural gas or coal.”\\n\\nThe WEO itself states that it doesn’t forecast but has *scenarios*—explorations or models of *possibilities*, and cautions: “Our scenario analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options…. [N]one of the scenarios should be viewed as a forecast.” Scenarios that usefully “inform” need to be based on realistic possibilities and assumptions. But there is one foundational assumption—one that the IEA has for decades included in its scenarios and that has been banished from the WEO: the possibility of business as usual (BAU).\\n\\nInstead, the WEO’s baseline scenario now assumes that nations are undertaking their\\n\\nspecific energy-transition plans that they promised in order to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement, i.e., “stated policies scenario” (STEPS). Yet none of the signatories to that Agreement is fully meeting its promises, and most are a long way behind schedule. Believing something that is not true is not just problematic; it meets the definition of a delusion.\\n\\nIt is fanciful to forecast that, over the next half-dozen years, the growth in the world’s population and economy won’t continue a two-century-long trend and lead to increased use of the fossil fuels that today supply over 80% of all energy, only slightly below the share seen 50 years ago. The data show that the global energy system is operating essentially along BAU lines and not only far off the STEPS, but even further away from the more aggressive transition aspirations that the WEO also models.\\n\\nIn this analysis, we focus on highlighting 23 problematic, flawed assumptions that are relevant specifically to the WEO’s oil scenarios and the widely reported “forecast” that the world will see peak oil demand by the early 2030s (see **box** on pp. 4-5, **Flawed Assumptions Lead to Flawed Conclusions**). While other scenarios about other energy sources are critical as well, oil remains a geopolitical touchstone and the single biggest source of global energy—10-fold greater than wind and solar combined. At the very least, this analysis points to the need for real-world scenarios in general and, in the case of oil, the much higher probability that demand continues to grow in the foreseeable future and, possibly, quite significantly (below, see **Global Oil Demand: Future Scenarios**).\\n\\nDebating the intricacies in flawed assumptions about energy scenarios is no mere theoretical exercise. The IEA’s legacy reputation continues to influence not only trillions of dollars in investment decisions but also government policies with far-reaching geopolitical consequences.\\n\\n#### Global Oil Demand: Future Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10b-Exec-Sum_Oil-Forecasts-WEO-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nThe promotional aspirations and flawed assumptions underlying IEA’s peak-demand scenarios have serious implications, given the obvious global economic and security considerations in planning for and delivering reliable, affordable energy supplies. The IEA is damaging its long legacy as the world’s leading energy security watchdog by offering dangerously misleading outlooks.\\n\\n## **Flawed Assumptions Lead to Flawed Conclusions**\\n\\nListed below is a summary of the flaws in 23 (but far from all) of the assumptions used in the WEO scenarios that are relevant to guessing future oil demand. Meaningful scenarios for planning for future uncertainties should include a range of realistic inputs, not just those that are aspirational.\\n\\n**Assumptions about baseline factors that affect oil forecasts**\\n\\n**Assumptions regarding oil’s future**\\n\\n**Assumptions about other transportation markets**\\n\\n**Assumptions regarding associated industries**\\n\\n## Introduction: The IEA and the Information Imperative\\n\\nFifty years ago, Germany’s Ulf Lantzke, an official at the OECD, was appointed as the first executive director of the new International Energy Agency (IEA). The organization’s creation followed the 1974 “energy shock” and consequent global recession. The recession was triggered by a roughly 400% jump in oil prices, the fallout from the oil embargo imposed in late 1973 by some members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.1 The motivation for establishing the IEA was thus not only to forge an international mechanism for coordination in the event of global energy disruptions but also to create a trusted source of global energy information.\\n\\nWhile much has changed in the world since 1974 in technological and political domains, what has not changed is the long-run trend of economic growth that uses more energy overall, including more fossil fuels. Not only do hydrocarbons continue to supply more than 80% of all global energy, but oil, the progenitor of the first modern energy crisis, remains the touchstone fuel in geopolitics and the single largest source of civilization’s energy supply. Energy markets and geopolitics are no less critical today than when the IEA was established, as is the need for reliable information.\\n\\nHowever, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, the IEA recast its mission to adopt advocacy of an “energy transition” alongside the original mission to support “energy security.”2 In 2022, the IEA’s governing board voted to expand the agency’s mission as one “to guide countries as they build net-zero emission energy systems to *comply* with internationally agreed climate goals” (emphasis added).3 As one report from the European Parliament put it, the “IEA has become an advocate of ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to combat climate change.”4\\n\\nWithout regard to the reasons for, or merits of, the shift in the IEA’s mission, the extent to which countries engage policies to displace hydrocarbons can itself have the potential to increase, rather than ameliorate, the risks of disruptions. Moreover, the extent to which such transition efforts become aspirational or motivational, rather than anchored in agnostic analyses, also creates challenges, in particular for information transparency and clarity for policy planning.\\n\\nThe publication each year of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) is a major event for energy policymakers and analysts everywhere. It is enormously influential because the IEA has 31 governments behind it whose energy priorities its work reflects and because there are few other studies with the breadth and depth seen in the IEA’s work, which is freely available to everyone.\\n\\n## Where We Agree with the IEA\\n\\nThe data, including data in the WEO, show that, thus far, there is no evidence of a rapid or even significant energy transition. In 1973 oil, coal, and natural gas contributed 85% of primary energy consumption, and in 2023 the share was 82%.5 Because hydrocarbons are used, whether directly or indirectly, in all products and services, it is vital to ensure that there is an adequate, reliable, and affordable supply for all countries. For developing nations, this is particularly important since, for them, the critical transition is not from hydrocarbons to renewables but away from having too little or unreliable energy in general.\\n\\nThe 2024 WEO highlights the key challenge of meeting the surprising—at least in contrast to the previous year’s WEO—increase in the expected need for electricity supplies for both emerging and mature economies: “[O]ne of the striking findings of this Outlook is how fast demand for electricity is set to rise, with the equivalent of the electricity use of the world’s ten largest cities being added to global demand each year” (p. 2).\\n\\nWhen it comes to providing the energy and materials needed for the electric sector, and all others, as Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director, notes in the WEO foreword: “The world is facing perilous times. Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s continued war in Ukraine have global attention sharply focused on some of the world’s most important energy-producing regions.” He notes that “energy security is again a major theme of this year’s World Energy Outlook” (p. 3). In that regard, few would disagree with Dr. Birol’s observation: “Robust, independent analysis and data-driven insights are vital to navigate today’s energy uncertainties” (p. 15).\\n\\nThus, we agree with the agency’s self-assessment: “The IEA’s flagship World Energy Outlook, published every year, is the most authoritative global source of energy analysis and projections. It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security, emissions and economic development” (p. 398).\\n\\nPlanning for the future is inherently a game of assumptions that can be plugged into models to consider potential outcomes around which governments and industries can make investment decisions. For planners everywhere, it is, of course, critical to gauge the extent to which models of future possibilities may be truly realistic, or merely aspirational, or even silly. Determining that depends almost entirely on assessing the underlying assumptions, the inputs to the models.\\n\\nThe assumptions integral to the IEA’s scenarios are based on explicit and implicit forecasts about both policies and, critically, about technologies.\\n\\nThe IEA clearly states that the WEO “examines three main long-term scenarios—*none of which are forecasts*—to provide a framework for understanding possible energy futures” (p. 67; emphasis added). However, the media and the analyst community treat the WEO as providing forecasts. There are myriad examples of invoking the “forecasts” from the IEA in news headlines and reports by financial analysts.6 The advocates of an “energy transition” also, unsurprisingly, invoke the WEO as providing forecasts: “The IEA’s forecast of an upcoming peak in demand for oil, gas, and coal remains unchanged.”7\\n\\nThis widespread conviction that the WEO makes *forecasts*, again, is not explicitly endorsed by the IEA, since the WEO repeats its caution in more than one place: “Our scenario analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options, not to predict how they will act, and *none of the scenarios should be viewed as a forecast*” (pp. 20, 69; emphasis added).\\n\\nThis has important consequences because the IEA’s scenarios are often viewed as the gold standard and are used to guide the policies of myriad governments and companies everywhere. Given the centrality of energy to all countries, the WEO can influence decisions about trillions of dollars of projects, subsidies, grants, and\\n\\ninducements, nearly all with the stated goal of achieving an energy transition away from hydrocarbons. As it observes, “all parties need to recognize that locking in fossil fuel use has consequences” (p. 20). Inversely, it is also true that locking out access to fossil fuels will have consequences.\\n\\nWhen it comes to policy or investment planning, there is a distinction with a critical difference when it comes to what constitutes a “forecast” (what is *likely* to happen) versus a “scenario” (a *possibility* based on assumptions). The challenge is not in determining whether the scenarios are completely factual per se, but instead whether they are factually complete.\\n\\nOne cannot have an unmanageable range of assumptions, given that scenarios and models are frequently treated as “forecasts,” or, at least, reasonable predictors; the use of unreasonable—even if theoretically possible— assumptions can lead to outcomes that are, by definition, improbable, if not nearly impossible. Thus, a core security and economic challenge for policymakers is to have scenarios that inform about real-world possibilities.\\n\\n## Where We Disagree with the IEA\\n\\nThe IEA’s scenarios are based on assumptions about:\\n\\nThe IEA asserts8 that the WEO “covers the whole energy system” to highlight “consequences and contingencies that lie ahead.” To realize that claim would require evaluating scenarios based on how, as the IEA states, “the energy system might be affected by changing key variables.” However, a careful reading of the voluminous WEO makes clear that the IEA does not come close to exploring the consequences arising from changes to key variables. Before turning to some of the claims and assumptions specific to oil (e.g., EV market penetration), we first highlight some key assumptions that are either flawed or disputable (thus calling for wider/different scenarios) that anchor those domains directly affecting oil-market forecasts.\\n\\n### 1. Assumptions About Baseline Factors That Affect Oil Forecasts\\n\\nIn order to fully reflect, as the WEO puts it, “today’s uncertainties” (p. 15), scenarios should begin with the possibility that some, or many, governments could modify or even abandon the “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS) that has been framed for compliance with the Paris Agreement. Of the three scenarios modeled by the IEA, STEPS is used as the baseline WEO scenario, and the other two scenarios are modeled on even more aggressive pledges and aspirations for replacing hydrocarbons: the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS); and the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario.\\n\\n#### **Flawed Assumption: STEPS is a useful baseline**\\n\\nIn earlier years, the WEO included a business as usual (BAU) scenario providing insights into future energy demands based on what countries and companies are actually doing rather than what they say they might do, or “pledge” to do. The merit of a BAU scenario should be obvious not only because it is a baseline anchored in the world as it is, but also because it can illuminate requirements and consequences for future energy demands if the world continues to operate as is, rather than “as wished for.”\\n\\nUsing STEPS as a de facto baseline is not just problematic but a borderline delusion—“belief in something that is not true.” No nation is doing what it has pledged to do. Only 10 small nations (collectively, about 1% share of global energy) are “almost sufficient” in meeting their Paris Agreement pledges. None of the other 30 nations is close9 (see **Figure 1**).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Corporate transition policies are real and durable*\\n\\nIt is clear from both news about and surveys of corporations that many businesses are slowly retreating from (or some entirely abandoning) many of the existing as well as pledged energy plans that are inherent in STEPS.\\n\\nIn recent months, we have seen several examples of major energy companies diluting their commitments to energy-transition targets. Until mid-2024, for example, BP was committed to reducing oil and gas output by 25% by 2030. Under its new leadership, the company has instead revised upward its plans to produce oil in the Gulf of Mexico while at the same time announcing the sale of its U.S. onshore wind energy business. Shell, too, has watered down transition-centric commitments. Previously, the company committed to reducing the net carbon intensity of its energy products by 20% from 2016 levels by 2030, 45% by 2035, and to “net zero” by 2050. Shell is now aiming for a 15%–20% reduction by 2030 and has dropped the 2035 target. Neither Shell nor BP is mentioned in the WEO.\\n\\nIn its long-term outlook to 2050, published in August 2024, ExxonMobil forecasts that oil demand, rather than shrinking, would remain close to 100 million barrels per day (mmbd) and that high levels of investment in exploration and development would be required to meet such demand.10\\n\\nWe cannot know what further changes other corporations may yet make. But these examples—and there are many others—show that energy-transition targets made several years ago are now being reassessed, reduced, or rejected in the face of the reality of a world that is using a lot more conventional energy to meet the needs of expanding economies and populations.\\n\\nWhile the IEA does not explicitly discount the potential for an extended era of higher economic growth in the next several decades, that is the implicit effect of WEO’s use of an average GDP growth rate that is at the low end of historical averages. It is problematic to base plans on the fact that all three WEO scenarios use the same assumption of a 2.7% annual growth for the global economy. The WEO offers the reasons: “We maintain a constant economic growth rate across scenarios to facilitate a comparison of the impacts of different energy and climate choices with a consistent backdrop” (p. 67). While there is some logic to that, it is prima facie an incomplete assumption for useful scenarios.\\n\\n### Figure 1: Ranking the Status of Paris-Centric Energy-Transition Plans\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-3.44.31%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\nMeanwhile, the WEO, along with others, sees the massive investment under way in AI and digital infrastructures such as data centers as a stimulant for growth. The WEO does focus on electricity demand from digital infrastructures, but that misses the broader point: those market-driven investments come from the economic value of the associated products and services, which suggests the potential for more growth than modeled.\\n\\nNo economist or policymaker should believe that he can predict the actual future economic growth rate. But for planning purposes, it is crucial to understand the consequences of a higher growth rate, not least because the pursuit of prosperity remains a central goal of (most) governments and because annual GDP global growth rates have frequently been a half-percentage point higher than the WEO models (see **Figure 2**). The WEO’s 2.7% annual growth rate is lower than the 3.2% average rate from 2010 to 2023. A scenario assuming, say, the same 3.2% annual growth rate—and a BAU relationship between GDP and oil—would lead to global oil demand in 2035 some 10 mmbd of oil greater than today. That difference is equal to adding another entire Europe Union to global oil demand.\\n\\n### Figure 2: Global GDP Growth Rate\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2-Global-GDP-Growth-Rate-IEA-1-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: Macrotrends, “[World GDP Growth Rate 1961-2024](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/WLD/world/gdp-growth-rate)“\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Transition financing will continue to expand*\\n\\nFinancing society-scale alternative energy technologies is proving to be a major obstacle to the achievement of energy-transition goals. While it is in developing countries where we find the need for most alternative energy finance, it is the developed world where most of the money goes. The WEO notes that “the share of clean energy investment in emerging market and developing economies outside of China remains stuck at 15% of the total, even though these economies account for two-thirds of the global population and one-third of global GDP” (p. 21). Whether, and how, this share can increase is a key issue for transition aspirations; real-world models would include scenarios where that issue remains unresolved.\\n\\nBefore looking at the immediate trends in energy financing, it is worth pointing out that the assumptions underpinning the financing of the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario are fantastical. The WEO states that in the\\n\\nNZE scenario, “annual spending on clean energy doubles in advanced economies and in China by 2035 compared with 2023 levels, while it grows more than six-fold in other developing economies” (p. 61; see **Figure 3**). There is no sign that this level of increase is happening or credible.\\n\\nMore modest climate finance targets—such as the commitment made at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 by rich countries to provide $100 billion each year in climate finance to developing countries—have not been met. The OECD tracks four primary sources of climate finance under the umbrella of that $100 billion initiative, and for the period 2013–21, the cumulative shortfall was $265 billion. Only in 2022 (the latest data available) was the target exceeded (see **Figure 4**). However, according to Oxfam, the British aid charity, even this apparent modest success is not what it seems.11 Oxfam reports that of the $116 billion pledged in 2022 (the last year for which OECD data are available), $92 billion was public finance, of which 70% was in the form of loans at market interest rates, not grants.\\n\\n### Figure 3: The WEO’s Fantastical Assumptions About Investment\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-3.58.32%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 4: Pledged vs. Actual Energy-Transition Financial Aid Sent to Emerging Markets\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-4-Pledged-vs-Actual-Energy-Transition-Financial-Aid-Sent-to-Emerging-Markets-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: OECD, “[Climate Finance and the USD 100 Billion Goal](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html),” 2022\\n\\nThe $100 billion tracked by the OECD is only a small part of the $2 trillion estimated by the IEA to have been committed globally in 2024 for “clean energy” investment. The WEO reports that $4.5 trillion a year is needed by 2030 and beyond to implement the NZE scenario (p. 155). In view of all the domestic pressures on governments in wealthy countries, the continuing impact everywhere of relatively high interest rates, and the continuing—if somewhat moderated—inflation in the costs of workforce and materials, it seems fantastical to believe that such an increase is feasible.\\n\\nThe investment challenge is summed up well in the WEO, even if the scenarios ignore the variables. The IEA sees three categories, or groups—which, again, should be modeled, but are not fully modeled. In the first group, investing in mature alternative energy technologies in well-regulated markets such as Brazil and India can be handled by the private sector. In the second group, the WEO calls for “facilitated interventions” (p. 65) to increase the deployment of alternative energy in less developed countries. The IEA notes that this “cover[s] projects where the national creditworthiness is low and a constraint on investors, or where significant social returns, such as those arising from improved energy access, need some form of public support to ensure affordability and bankability” (p. 65). How much appetite there is in the private sector and, indeed, international institutions for “facilitated interventions” remains to be seen. Certainly, the debates and resistance to such expansion are evident and, again, suggest that scenarios need to incorporate fewer, not more, financial “interventions.” The third group, albeit representing only about 6% of projects in the NZE scenario, essentially covers very high-risk countries (a euphemism for corrupt and unstable) that might involve “nascent” (p. 65) technologies (a euphemism for either unproven or nonexistent on a commercial scale).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Efficiency gains and structural changes will lower global demand for energy*\\n\\nA significant feature in the WEO scenarios entails claims about the means not only for reducing energy growth but for the possibility of achieving an absolute *reduction* in overall energy use, even as populations and economies expand. Setting aside the questionable durability of imposed mandates (such as banning the sales of conventional vehicles or natural gas residential heating), or proposed behavioral changes (such as fewer personal automobiles, fewer vacation flights, etc.), the WEO rests much on the effect of changes to the “structure of the global economy” and the effect of greater technical efficiency. The former is the continued migration of nations to service-centric economies and the latter to efficiency gains in end-use equipment (pp. 25, 26).\\n\\nThat maturing economies migrate toward greater dominance of services in their GDP, rather than industries, is a well-established long-run trend. But that trend has not resulted in lowering overall global energy demand; rather, it has shifted much demand from mature to emerging economies. It has also created the illusion of lower energy use in mature economies, thus creating misleading impressions of improvements in national energy efficiencies. Domestic energy efficiencies should be more properly calculated, especially for the U.S. and Europe—the exemplars of the service-efficiency trend—by including the energy embodied in imports of products or materials (e.g., steelmaking and aluminum) from countries such as China or India. The aviation industry, for example, is a service sector with operational energy uses that, self-evidently, include the use of energy-intensive hardware and materials, but much of the latter is produced offshore and is invisible in domestic data.\\n\\nRegarding long-run efficiency trends of devices and machines, the WEO reflects well-established views that there are “improvements in the technical efficiency of energy use, via more efficient processes or equipment” (p. 26). In a static economy, that would arithmetically result in lowered energy use. However, as is widely known, the overall long-run reality is that foundational efficiency gains drive net growth in overall demand— the so-called Jevon’s Paradox. There is no evidence that this multi-century trend has changed in recent decades (see **Figure 5**).\\n\\n### Figure 3: Global Trends: Energy Efficiency vs. Total Energy Consumption\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-5-Global-Trends-Energy-Efficiency-vs-Total-Energy-Consumption-1500x1184.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Solar and wind power are 100% efficient*\\n\\nIn the WEO discussion about energy efficiency, we find a particularly odd, and fundamentally incorrect, claim that has the earmarks of an overenthusiastic talking point, rather than an idea rooted in reality: “Unlike fossil fuels, most renewables are *considered 100% efficient*, i.e., conversion losses are not measured because the resources are directly harnessed from naturally occurring sources of energy, such as sunlight, wind and water, without the need for extraction or combustion processes” (p. 27; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe observation that the sun and wind “resources are directly harnessed” is misleading, an artifact of boundary choices. The harnessing requires building machines that entail energy-intensive materials that significantly affect resource-to-user efficiencies. Fabricating solar photovoltaic (PV) silicon, for example, is at least 10-fold more energy-intensive per pound than fabricating steel.\\n\\nRegardless of the rhetorical flourish about “directly” harnessing, the 100% claim itself is simply a violation of fundamental physics, both incorrect and impossible. There *are* conversion losses; one has to define boundaries. Claiming 100% efficiency for a PV cell’s output is logically the same as claiming 100% efficiency for a combustion engine’s output.\\n\\nA conventional (widely used) PV cell converts ~15% to 20% of the available energy in incident photons into electricity. The physical scale, economic, and materials costs of solar electricity are, self-evidently, dictated by that inefficiency and the very low energy density of the primary source (incident solar energy).\\n\\nA conventional (widely used) gas turbine converts ~40% to 60% of the available energy in natural gas into electricity. A conventional combustion engine converts ~20% to 30% of the available energy in fuel into mechanical energy.12 The scale, costs, and materials used are similarly dictated by that inefficiency but offset by the far higher density of hydrocarbons.\\n\\nHigher efficiencies have been demonstrated for both PV cells and engines using existing materials and technologies, as much as about 50% for PV cells and nearly 80% for combustion turbines. There is, from the physics (and economics) of wind and solar, nothing particularly unique in that regard, or inherently more efficient.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China’s actions will follow its pledges*\\n\\nBefore turning to the assumptions that are specifically focused on scenarios for future oil demand, we note one additional example of WEO assumptions that are debatable, if not profoundly unrealistic: those associated with China’s energy trajectory. The WEO sees China’s coal use starting to shrink in a few years (see **Figure 6**). This seems unlikely, given that China’s electricity generation from coal in 2023 was 37% higher than a decade earlier;13 and in the same period, China has added to its grid 390 GW of new coal-fired capacity, and there are plans for another 141 new power stations (not taking into account retirements).14 Considering that such power plants have an operating life of over 40 years, a reasonable scenario would also model increasing, not declining, coal use, regardless of China’s “stated policies.”\\n\\n### Figure 6: WEO China Energy Scenario\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-4.10.56%E2%80%AFPM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 7: Transportation Costs as a Share of Final Product Prices\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-7-Transportation-Costs-as-a-Share-of-Final-Product-Prices-1500x1184.png)\\n\\nSource: Jean-Paul Rodrigue, “[Share of Transport Costs in Product Prices and Average Domestic Haul Length](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter3/transportation-and-economic-development/transport-costs-prices-domestic-haul-united-states/),” in *The Geography of Transport Systems*, 6th ed. (New York: Routledge, 2024), chap. 3\\n\\n### 2. Assumptions Regarding Oil’s Future\\n\\nPetroleum supplies 40% of global energy, wind and solar combined about 4%, and all other renewables— mainly hydro dams and biomass—bring the renewable total to under 10%.\\n\\nOver 95% of the movement of all people, goods, and services is powered by machines that burn oil.15 Since 1974, the number of cars in the world has increased by 500%, total maritime tons shipped is up 350%, and air-travel passenger miles have risen nearly 2,000%.16 Economies collapse if the costs of transportation soar or, worse, cease (see **Figure 7**).\\n\\nIn the WEO, as well as in the IEA’s monthly *Oil Market Report* and its latest medium-term outlook Oil 2024— Analysis and Forecast to 2030, the agency assumes that global oil demand will peak before 2030, based on the WEO’s STEPS—that current policies and programs will be implemented as planned. However, as outlined above, this is less, rather than more, likely to be the case. This is partly because of the inevitable changes in governments, not least in the U.S., which has the world’s biggest oil market. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely, given the current political climate in many key countries, that future changes will lead to tougher policies to implement the Paris Agreement. Rather, the commitment is likely to weaken.\\n\\nIn the 2024 WEO (chap. 4), the IEA considers the possibility that oil demand could be higher or lower than shown in the STEPS. Although this might appear to be a nod to criticism leveled at the 2023 WEO, which also did not contain a BAU scenario, the variations in oil demand considered in the 2024 WEO are far from a realistic assessment of known ranges of possibilities.\\n\\nIn a recent edition of its *Oil Market Report*17 and its five-year outlook,18 the IEA shows global oil demand rising from 102.9 mmbd in 2024 to 105.4 mmbd in 2030, with the expectation that 2030 is a definitive peak. This is wishful thinking, given the realities of growing needs in developing countries. For global oil demand to peak by 2030, it must be assumed that developing countries won’t grow at the pace seen in recent decades—never mind, the hoped-for faster growth.\\n\\nPetroleum liquids consumption by OECD countries did peak back in 2005 and today it is 11% lower due to efficiency gains, saturation in some passenger vehicle markets, and a significant drop in oil used for electric power generation (mainly in Europe).19\\n\\nIn 2005, when OECD oil demand peaked, the rest of the world’s far greater population used just 67% as much oil as the rich countries. That ratio has flipped: it is now the OECD that uses only 81% as much oil as do all the developing countries.20\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The oil growth in emerging markets will be low*\\n\\nWhile the growth of oil demand in developing countries has been significant, there remains an enormous disparity when it is compared with the per-capita oil use of the wealthier OECD nations. Even in China, which has seen three decades of strong economic growth, oil use per capita remains only 36% of the OECD average. More significantly, India uses only 12% of the OECD’s per-capita average, and Africa is at only 9% of the OECD average.\\n\\nPopulations in developing countries are growing rapidly: Nigeria’s population, for example, is expected to grow from 230 million in 2024 to 380 million by 2050. For India, the corresponding numbers are 1.44 billion to 1.67 billion; the numbers in the African continent are 1.49 billion to 2.49 billion. The net increase in overall global population by 2050 versus 2024 is estimated to be 1.6 billion people.21 Many of them could be, by 2050, even wealthier than the doubling of global GDP that the WEO assumes (p. 301).\\n\\nIt is inconceivable that these rising populations with growing economies will not experience enormous increases in oil use. This will come from increasing numbers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles of all kinds, and, as disposable incomes rise, far more citizens will not only travel but also buy more goods. The latter, in turn, means more plastics, which requires more petrochemicals, i.e., more oil and gas.\\n\\nWith little credibility, the WEO asserts that its sensitivity analysis shows that “even *combining all the high cases, global peaks for oil*, natural gas and coal demand *would still occur within a few years* of those for STEPS, albeit at higher absolute levels” (p. 165; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe realistic potential for very strong upward oil-demand pressure from developing countries is entirely absent from WEO scenarios.\\n\\nConsider a useful exercise to illustrate the theoretically possible growth in oil demand outside OECD countries. One could simply extrapolate China’s current per-capita oil use to the rest of the non-OECD world. China is a useful benchmark because its oil use has increased year-on-year since 1993 (demand did not fall, even during the pandemic lockdowns of 2020) and is now seven times higher than 30 years ago.\\n\\nNon-OECD (excluding China) oil demand at Chinese per-capita levels would be 23 mmbd higher than today, representing 10-fold more growth than in the WEO STEPS. That increase would more than offset declining gasoline use in wealthy nations, leading to global demand reaching 126 mmbd—some 20% higher than the peak imagined by the WEO (see **Figure 8**).\\n\\nIf emerging markets were ever to match the OECD average per-capita usage, global oil demand would exceed a staggering 230 mmbd, versus 103 mmbd in 2024. For many reasons, we are not suggesting that developing countries will soon, or even ever, reach the OECD per-capita oil level. But 230 mmbd gives one a sense of the direction of potential ultimate demand.\\n\\nEven though the WEO failed to do so, it would be reasonable to assume a baseline scenario where emerging-market oil demand grows at the same annual rate of 2.3% seen since 1990.22 This would yield in 2030 a demand that is 6.7 mmbd higher than in 2023; and in 2035, it will be 12.1 mmbd higher, both of which are about 3 mmbd and 9 mmbd higher than the WEO STEPS.\\n\\nThe gap between a reasonable BAU scenario and the WEO widens if one, also reasonably, assumes that there is a good chance that wealthy economies will see less of a decline in oil use than assumed in all the WEO scenarios. Assumptions about the market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) are, of course, the central feature in the WEO oil calculations.\\n\\n### Figure 8: Oil-Demand Potential\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.23.56-PM.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The EV market share will accelerate*\\n\\nThe far greater use of EVs constitutes a centerpiece of the WEO. For that reason alone, a full range of variables should be, but are not, incorporated into its scenarios of future demand. The WEO assumes that the “market share of new electric passenger cars sold in the STEPS reaches about 45% by 2030” (p. 174) and “to over 55% by 2035” (p. 160).\\n\\nThe recent, rapid growth rate of EV sales in wealthy nations is slowing, not accelerating. Regardless of whether the slowdown is temporary, or the new normal, that reality should be in planning scenarios. IEA data show that 11% of vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2023 were electric. For the world, EV sales that year were 18%—but that figure is highly distorted by China’s massive domestic subsidies, resulting in that nation accounting for 60% of global EVs sold. Meanwhile, the 2023 share of EVs sold in India was 2%, Brazil 3%, Indonesia 2%, Malaysia 2%, Thailand 10%, and Vietnam 15%.23 In developing countries with rapidly growing populations, the rate of ownership of any type of vehicle is still very low: India has only 59 cars per thousand people of driving age, compared with 226 in China. In Nigeria, the figure is 61. For context, in the U.S. there are 908 cars per thousand people of driving age.24 Whether rising vehicle ownership is dominated, or not, by EVs will depend on many factors, but in the main, by price.\\n\\nIn its annual EV report, the IEA estimated that in 2023, EVs displaced about 0.8 mmbd of global oil demand (gasoline and diesel).25 In the conclusion of its 2024 oil report (one of the inputs to the WEO), the IEA asserts that efficiency improvements and electrification mean that global gasoline use peaked in 2024, at 27.2 mmbd; and by 2030, it will have fallen to 25.4 mmbd. But this is based on “policy settings,” not by real-world trends.26\\n\\nThe behavior of automakers offers an obvious example of a divergence between policy settings and reality, trends that have been clear for many months prior to the publication of the 2024 WEO. The WEO asserts that “the number of electric car sales in the STEPS is aligned with the plans of the automotive industry. Although some automakers have recently scaled back short-term EV production plans, their longer-term EV plans still point to the production of well over 40 million electric cars per year by 2030” (p. 36). The WEO does go on to note that there “have also been some rollbacks and postponements of previous [EV] policies, although the impact of these remains relatively small” (p. 81). A reasonable sensitivity analysis would at least consider the trends continuing, and even expanding.\\n\\nDuring 2024, there were myriad announcements from car manufacturers that the production of EVs would be lower than forecast in response to weaker consumer demand. A recent example was the Ford Motor Company’s third-quarter 2024 results.27 The company lost $1.2 billion in its EV business. Based on the sales volume of 20,962 EVs, Ford lost nearly $60,000 on each such vehicle sold. But Ford’s forecast is not the only one. Volkswagen, General Motors, and Mercedes are also paring back their market forecasts.28 Fundamental issues impair consumer adoption, not least EVs’ affordability. There was also the performance of EVs in cold weather, inadequate charging infrastructure in general, and, especially, the cost and availability of high-speed charging to come closer to the refueling time for regular gasoline vehicles. Meanwhile, the EV market consists largely of wealthy buyers.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Governments will stay the course on EV mandates*\\n\\nIn the WEO, the IEA points out that of the 17 million units estimated to have been sold in 2024, 10 million will be in China (p. 34). In a command economy, there is little transparency concerning costs and revenues, and there is no doubt that massive government subsidies have played a major part in China’s EV expansion. In Western countries, subsidies are being scaled back. At the end of 2022, the German government abruptly cut back its subsidies. Sweden did the same thing early in 2023, as did New Zealand at the end of the year. While government support for EVs continues in those countries and others, budgetary pressures are now a factor in scaling back support.\\n\\nThe new Trump administration is unlikely to tighten regulations governing the fuel-efficiency standards for ICE vehicles. Indeed, some rollback is expected. Also, the subsidies for EVs and batteries built in to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could be scaled back. In the EU, the political drive behind environmental measures is, at a minimum, fracturing following elections in several member countries.\\n\\nWhen the 2024 WEO was developed, the IEA could not have anticipated the U.S. election outcome. But a reasonable sensitivity analysis would incorporate the slowdown and reversals of EV subsidies in other nations, and consider the fact that any anticipated increase in U.S. subsidies was already at risk (p. 37). Ahead of the 2024 U.S. election, the costs of the IRA subsidies were already subject to increasing scrutiny, not least by a report from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) noting that the IRA spends $32,000 for each additional EV sold and that 75% of the EV subsidies claimed thus far under that law have gone to consumers who would have bought an EV anyway.29\\n\\nNonetheless, the WEO sticks to its fundamentally optimistic—and, from a scenario modeling perspective, narrow—assumptions about EVs, such as: “Although some incentive schemes have been revised, governments remain active in supporting EV uptake in a variety of ways” (p. 37). Another such assumption: “Around 30 countries have set zero emissions vehicle goals or timelines to phase out ICE vehicles. In the STEPS, electric car sales reach more than 40 million globally by 2030, which means that nearly one-in-two cars sold that year will be either a battery electric or a plug-in hybrid vehicle” (p. 110).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China’s EV “success story” leads quickly to lower oil demand*\\n\\nChina, which is regularly cited by the IEA and others as a major success story for EVs and significant oil displacement, may not be as it seems. A recent paper by Kpler, a global data and analysis company, suggests that although sales of EVs in China reached a 51% market share in September 2024, at the end of the year the total on-road vehicle fleet was still over 80% gasoline-fueled, with EVs at 13%.30 Kpler points out that gasoline cars will still constitute 70% of China’s fleet in 2030 and that the share will not fall below 50% until 2040. The impact on gasoline demand will not, according to the company, be as dramatic as many believe. Today, with large numbers of gasoline cars still being purchased, only 1% of new EVs are replacing gasoline cars. At expected rates of EV growth, it won’t be until the early 2030s that EVs lead to net displacement of existing gasoline cars. Before then, gasoline demand in China will remain relatively stable. Yet the IEA believes that gasoline demand in China “may even tip into decline from 2025 amid rampant, mass-market electrification.”31\\n\\nAnother issue highlighted in Kpler’s paper is the discrepancy between theoretical claims of gasoline consumption from carmakers and the actual performance in the real world. In China, real gasoline consumption is about 15% higher than claimed by the manufacturers, and today the fleet is not reaching the aspirational fuel-consumption goals. The Kpler analysis finds 248,000 barrels a day of gasoline being displaced in China by EVs, versus the IEA’s estimate of about 600,000 b/d.32\\n\\n### 3. Assumptions About Other Transportation Markets\\n\\nAlthough EVs constitute the epicenter of variables relevant to future oil displacement, the WEO devotes considerable effort, and apparent enthusiasm, to the potential for electrifying virtually all other forms of transportation and adjacent uses for petroleum. One may be tempted to speculate about PR motives, i.e., providing the impression of “accelerating” electrification of everything (see **Figure 9**). The fact is that these other sectors are either realistically impossible to significantly electrify (e.g., heavy-duty trucks, aircraft), or, where it is easy (e.g., bicycles), the oil displacement is irrelevant. The WEO notes that electrifying global two- and three-wheelers would displace 750,000 barrels per day, or under 1% of demand.\\n\\n### Figure 9: Forecast Global Market Shares\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.18.34-PM.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification of heavy-duty trucks*\\n\\nTrucking, which accounts for ~17% of global oil use, compared with ~25% for automobiles, will remain a hard sector to electrify, especially in long-distance applications. The reasons are similar to those affecting the growth of EVs in the passenger market: the range and time needed for recharging. Electrification is likely to proceed in short-haul delivery fleets, buses, etc., a trend visible in China’s command economy, where heavy-duty trucks saw a 10% share of sales in 2023 (p. 109); but globally in 2030, only 3% of larger trucks will be electric (p. 110).\\n\\nCost remains a major barrier for electrifying long-distance trucks, with new vehicle prices two to three times higher than conventional diesel-fueled vehicles.33 Even if costs fall, the collateral challenges for improvements to charging infrastructure remain daunting. Electrification is not yet a significant factor for trucking and buses. In 2023, only 3% of all bus sales were electrified. The IEA does not provide data for 2023; but we know that in 2022, only 1.2% of worldwide truck sales were electric.34\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification and fuel alternatives in aviation*\\n\\nGlobal aviation accounts for about 10% of all oil use. The WEO acknowledges the exceptional difficulty of electrifying aviation or decarbonizing the fuel, but it devotes significant effort to imagining opportunities and, more critically, ignores factors that could drive far higher oil demand. It points to various initiatives to increase blending into the aviation-fuel pool of “sustainable fuels”; but in 2030 and 2050, they will contribute only 2% and 10%, respectively (p. 111). All this is in the context of WEO’s anemic projections for potential increases in aviation-fuel demand.\\n\\nThe IEA base case (STEPS) sees jet-fuel consumption in 2030 just 13% higher than in 2024, and the pre-Covid peak demand not reached again until 2027. Meanwhile, independent data from the Airports Council International (ACI) show that 2024 passenger volumes are already at 106% of the 2019 level.35 In the longer term, ACI forecasts that passenger volumes by 2042 will be double the 2024 level. While aircraft-fuel efficiency will inevitably improve, the rise in passenger numbers suggests that fuel consumption could grow far more than in the STEPS (p.316). And the APS implausibly sees jet kerosene consumption peaking by 2030 and down 4% by 2050.\\n\\nAll this is in the context of an industry that is expected to boom in the decades to come. Asia is a major source of expansion, with a 57% growth in intra-regional travel demand projected by 2030 versus the pre-pandemic year of 2019.36 Moreover, air-cargo shipments are also expected to grow. While air freight is only 1% of global trade by volume, it represents 35% by value.37\\n\\nThe WEO also failed to acknowledge the travails of aircraft manufacturers, specifically those in the global duopoly of Boeing and Airbus Industries, in delivering newer and more efficient aircraft. Delays in updating the fleet mean that older, more fuel-hungry, aircraft will remain in service longer. At the same time, many airlines are keeping older aircraft in service for longer, in order to meet demand and save capital. Older aircraft, however, typically burn 15% more fuel than newer models.38\\n\\nThese factors will collaterally drive the need for greater airport capacity, a facet of the market ignored or underestimated in WEO scenarios. Independent analysts see six of the 10 most significant global airport projects located in Asia and the Middle East and two in the U.S. (Los Angeles and New York). The word “airport” doesn’t appear anywhere in the WEO.39\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be significant electrification and fuel alternatives for ships*\\n\\nSome 80% of global trade is carried by ships. While the STEPS in WEO correctly sees international bunker-fuel demand growing out to 2050, the APS projects a 9% decline by 2035 (p. 304).\\n\\nThe targeted reduction in shipping fuel use was set by the International Maritime Organization seeking a 20% CO2 emissions reduction by 2030, 70% by 2040, and full-scale decarbonization around 2050 (benchmarked from 2008 levels). Real-world analysts see no prospect of meeting shipping goals in either STEPS or APS. As of June 2024, 93% of the gross tonnage of ships in operation used conventional fuels (various grades of fuel oil/ marine diesel).40 The other 7% consisted almost entirely of LNG-fueled ships with minuscule shares for LPG and nonconventional fuels (ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, and battery/hybrid vessels). For ships on order, oil-fueled accounts for 51%, with LNG’s share at 36%. And while the WEO frequently mentions hydrogen and ammonia (e.g., p. 111), those fuels account for 0.7% of orders.\\n\\nWe note that the WEO doesn’t mention the one viable opportunity for reducing maritime fuel use: the potential for ships to use electricity when docked at port. As much as 7% of ships’ energy consumption occurs there, and from 2030 and 2035, respectively, two sets of EU regulations state that certain categories of vessels must connect to shoreside electricity while docked. The EU regulations are complex and look unlikely to be fully implemented; nonetheless, they are in place.41\\n\\nMeanwhile, the IEA nowhere mentions the potential for a massive rise in demand for shipping—and collaterally for fuel used. This is directly related to the huge increase in the need for minerals required for constructing the alternative energy hardware imagined in all WEO scenarios. The WEO does provide estimates for the staggering increases in mineral demands but ignores the shipping. *The Maritime Executive* magazine estimates that 2,300–3,500 new ships will be needed annually through 2040. Shipbuilders are currently adding 400–500 new bulk carriers a year.42\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: There will be a rapid decline in oil used for Middle East power generation*\\n\\nThe WEO points to the significant 1.7 mmbd of oil burned in the Middle East’s power-generation sector, representing 25% of that region’s electricity supply (p. 177). While the WEO acknowledges that there is much uncertainty about whether this oil will be replaced by natural gas and renewables, STEPS assumes a nearly 50% drop in oil use by 2030. However, thus far there is little evidence of concrete action being taken in those countries to turn “stated policies” into reality within the next few years. Indeed, data show that in July 2024, Saudi Arabia saw the second-highest monthly oil burn ever for power generation.43\\n\\nWhile the IEA correctly points to such initiatives as the Liquid Fuel Displacement Programme in Saudi Arabia, part of that nation’s overall Vision 2030 economic development and diversification strategy, it is not clear that those plans will be implemented to meet the targets included in STEPS.44 In the IEA’s own words, “specific plans to achieve this objective have not yet been established” (p. 177).\\n\\nThe reduction of oil used in power generation may occur in due course, given many long-term plans, including for local natural gas gathering projects, as well as investments in wind, solar, and nuclear energy. The UAE has three nuclear reactors, and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Iraq have expressed interest in nuclear energy. But none of this will be relevant by 2030.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The growth in petrochemicals and plastics will be slow*\\n\\nThe WEO identifies petrochemicals, today about 20% of global oil use, as the one sector that will see growth through 2035 in both the STEPS and APS (p. 139). Global LPG/ethane and naphtha demand will rise by 14% by 2030. Europe is the exception, where a slight decline is forecast, due to weak economic growth and a shift of petrochemicals manufacturing to Asia.\\n\\nThe WEO joins many other analysts in seeing the growth of petrochemicals in China. Much of that will be driven by the significant and unavoidable use of lots of plastics in the manufacture of EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels, in addition to the universal use of polymers in clothing, packaging, building materials, household goods, medical products, consumer goods, etc. (p. 140).\\n\\nWhile assumptions about recycling are key to forecasting in the plastics sector, the WEO states:[1][O]ver 90 countries have passed a full or partial ban on single-use plastics and more than 20 to establish recycling targets and collection policies. Nonetheless, plastic waste collection for recycling has increased only relatively modestly: 12% of global plastic waste was collected for recycling in 2010, which rose to just 19% in 2023, with marked differences between the collection rates in advanced economies (27%) and emerging market and developing economies (13%). Policy momentum would be boosted by the conclusion of the United Nations’ treaty to end plastic pollution, which has been under negotiation since 2022.45 (p. 120)\\n\\nAfter the WEO was published, the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on the Global Plastics Treaty (INC-5) finished without a deal.46\\n\\nThe WEO notes that there are interesting but uncommercialized technologies to enhance recycling (p. 120), and it suggests unspecified increases in R&D and recycling facilities. But sensible scenarios would include the low probability of that happening soon, or of any global treaty being enacted, or of significantly greater recycling rates after years of exhortation by governments and widespread bans on such things as plastic shopping bags, bottles, and straws.\\n\\nThe 2.7 mmbd of oil demand that WEO’s APS states can be avoided by 2050 is, at best, a questionable assumption (p. 120).\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: All scenarios lead to peak oil demand by ~2030*\\n\\nThe WEO’s overarching conclusion, widely repeated in media around the world—and, as noted earlier, often cited as a “forecast”—was that, “even *combining all the high cases, global peaks* for oil . . . would still occur within a few years of those for STEPS, albeit at higher absolute levels” (p. 165; emphasis added).\\n\\nYet it is clear that if the WEO were to have properly included a BAU scenario—which reflected a more realistic range of outcomes associated with known variables for potential oil demands, as outlined above—then peak oil demand would *not* occur in the time frames explored (see **Figure 10**).\\n\\nScenarios based on real-world trends of rising global oil demands should suggest to policymakers that the world could experience, and should plan for, even greater challenges associated with both the affordability and security of oil supplies.\\n\\n### 4. Assumptions Regarding Associated Industries\\n\\nThe WEO’s scenarios are also anchored in numerous other problematic assumptions. We consider, briefly, three other classes of such assumptions: those relating to the availability and prices of critical minerals (a key input for EV costs, and thus adoption); the security of the supplies of those minerals; and the adequacy and security of future petroleum supplies.\\n\\n### *Flawed Assumption: The supply of critical minerals will meet transition goals*\\n\\nThe IEA has recognized and studied the fact that increasing the use of EVs entails a fundamental shift from enormous petroleum liquid supply infrastructures to other enormous infrastructures involving solid materials and chemical refining to produce the batteries. Indeed, in 2021 the IEA issued a seminal report on the nature and quantities of “energy minerals” that will be needed to build the hardware contemplated in the energy-transition scenarios.47\\n\\nThe expansion of mining operations for critical minerals is a linchpin for the achievement of IEA’s long-term energy-transition goals. The agency acknowledges that mining operations are highly capital-intensive and require very long lead times but fails to model the consequences of a world undersupplied with “energy minerals.”\\n\\nIn what constitutes an epic understatement, the WEO observes that for “a number of critical minerals, supply growth from the pipeline of confirmed and announced projects is set to be slower than expected growth in demand” (p. 33). Setting aside optimism about the availability of capital and the absence of environmentalists’ opposition to new mega-mines, the WEO sees a significant near-term, one-decade gap between the supply and demand for minerals needed (see **Figure 11**).\\n\\nFrom outside the IEA, there are now numerous excellent analyses of mineral constraints, many of which do a more creditable job of exploring various metals markets. In a May 2024 report from the International Energy Forum that focused on copper, there is a key conclusion that “just to meet business-as-usual trends, 115% more copper must be mined in the next 30 years than has been mined historically until now. To electrify the global vehicle fleet requires bringing into production 55% more new mines than would otherwise be needed.”48\\n\\nThe WEO is eager to point out that such facts “*should not be interpreted* to mean that energy-transition goals are unattainable due to material constraints” (p. 218; emphasis added). Perhaps—but one sensible interpretation is that the goals could indeed be material-constrained. Failure to incorporate the full range of minerals challenge is a key flaw in the WEO assumptions. Policy makers would reasonably want a scenario that modeled the consequences in terms of what would be feasible in scenarios of insufficient metals supply.\\n\\n### Figure 10A: WEO Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.11.27-PM.png)\\n\\n### Figure 10B: Business as Usual and Possible Scenarios\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10b-Exec-Sum_Oil-Forecasts-WEO-1-1500x1184.png)\\n\\n### Figure 11: Supply and Demand for “Energy Minerals”\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.03.08-PM.png)\\n\\nThe WEO offers as an overarching idea what can only be termed a naively optimistic faith in markets to solve the minerals problem: “Market *signals should lead* to the development of new projects, although new mining projects tend to have very long lead times” (p. 33; emphasis added).\\n\\nThe idea that “market signals” will result in an adequate supply of critical energy minerals is belied by IEA’s own analysis of the timelines (10–15 years) required for developing new mines. No economist doubts that the word “signal” means higher prices, and necessarily (given long lead times) for very long periods.\\n\\nWhile the WEO observes that “low prices” could lead to mine closures, further constraining supplies, it offers, without specificity in terms of efficacy, a set of aspirational—and some, frankly, risible—policy ideas that, it proposes, could lead industries to increase production:\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Prices of critical minerals will be low*\\n\\nIn a startling acknowledgment, the IEA states: “*We do not yet model* full long-term supply-demand balances for critical minerals in the same way as for fuels” (p. 91; emphasis added). This is a major flaw in a central part of all the WEO scenarios and surprising in its absence, since the IEA identified this knowledge gap nearly four years ago in its own energy minerals study. The WEO notes: “Around 30% of the cost of a battery pack now depends on the cost of critical minerals, and battery costs are increasingly susceptible to mineral price volatility.” And that “there is no alternative at present for some of the critical minerals” (p. 96; see **Figure 12**).\\n\\n### Figure 12: Cathode Raw Material Costs as a Share of EV Battery Prices\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-12.07.06-PM-1.png)\\n\\nSince a “market signal” of higher prices is essential for supplying adequate materials, it begs the question as to the impact of those prices on the final cost of batteries for EVs (as well as mineral-dependent wind and solar hardware) and derivatively the impediments to consumer adoption. The WEO doesn’t ignore the possibility that “reduced investment [in minerals] *could* lead to future supply shortages and price spikes. This *could* slow reductions in clean energy technology costs, *or even increase them*, as happened in 2022 with battery pack prices, *potentially* clean energy technology deployment” (p. 94; emphases added).\\n\\nThe WEO hedges its rhetoric but not its models, observing that[2]lower [mineral] prices have helped to bring about lower clean technology costs, including a 14% reduction in battery pack costs in 2023 but they are now dampening the investment appetite for new resource developments, with *implications for future* supply diversification (BNEF, 2023). In the case of nickel, for example, three-quarters of operating or potential *projects that are at risk* in today’s price environment are outside the top-three producing countries. If they *close because of low* prices, supply will become further concentrated among the largest suppliers. (p. 216; emphases added)\\n\\nAgain, the IEA does not model these implications. Instead, the WEO, incredibly, simply ignores the possibility of a scenario with higher-, not lower-cost, EVs.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: China won’t exercise minerals dominance as an economic or a geopolitical too*\\n\\nThere is rising geopolitical concern over the fact that control of vast stocks of the critical minerals needed for the manufacture of batteries is highly concentrated in a few countries, some of which have geopolitical priorities that have the potential to clash with Western interests. This is true not just for raw materials and refined minerals but also for key components of wind, solar, and battery hardware (see **Figure 13**).\\n\\n### Figure 13: Global Market Shares: Key EV Battery Components\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-11.58.36-AM.png)\\n\\nThe WEO cautions: “Security of clean energy supply chains and critical minerals—The overall level of geographic concentration in manufacturing is therefore set to remain high, even if all announced projects come to fruition” (p. 214). Since, as the WEO also notes, energy mineral resource concentration is far greater than with hydrocarbons, it cautions: “Policy makers need to be alert to the new energy security risks that are emerging in clean energy and look for ways to mitigate them” (p. 33). However, again, there is no attempt to include in scenario models the implications arising from such “resource concentration.”\\n\\nThe IEA points out that China produces 80% of the world’s battery cells. It controls 65% of the global processing capacity for lithium and 75% of the global processing capacity for cobalt. China also produces 50% of the world’s lead (p. 76). A handful of other countries are dominant players in critical minerals. In 2023, half of global nickel production was in Indonesia while 73% of global cobalt production was in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Australia and Chile in 2023 produced 65% of the global total of lithium that year, with China taking a further 13% share. Interestingly, according to the World Economic Forum,49 the U.S. was the world’s leading lithium producer up to 1995, with a one-third share of the total.\\n\\nThis degree of concentration might change in due course. However, as the WEO acknowledges, based on the current pipeline of new mining projects, the concentration of mining activity is unlikely to change: “[S]ome 50–75% of supply growth for refined copper, lithium, and cobalt is projected to come from today’s largest producers, and the same is true for about 90% of battery-grade graphite supply and nickel growth” (p. 217).\\n\\n### Figure 14: Global Annual Investments in Fossil Fuels\\n\\n![](https://energyanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screen-Shot-2025-01-22-at-11.54.06-AM-1.png)\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: Oil and gas annual investments are adequate to avoid economic disruptions*\\n\\nThere is an inherent tension in the WEO scenarios regarding the future price and availability of oil. On the one hand, scenarios that see oil in excess supply while demand declines point to lower prices, which, in turn, amplify the cost penalties of avoiding oil use. On the other hand, if scenarios see constrained supply with sustained or higher demand, that self-evidently drives prices up and creates economic headwinds, including broad-based inflation. The latter occurs regardless of scenarios since, in the time frames considered, oil continues to have a dominant role in supply chains and transportation across all energy sectors including, and especially, the energy-intensive mining and minerals domains. Without considering a full range of realistic scenarios for future oil supply, there is little credibility for the WEO conclusion that “*oil prices* in our scenarios act as intermediaries to *balance* *global supply and demand*, ensuring markets remain in equilibrium” (p. 90; emphasis added).\\n\\nAll the WEO scenarios, including STEPS, which constitutes the de facto baseline, assume that: a) fossil fuels will be oversupplied even as governments discourage investment; and thus, b) fossil fuels will be available to “bridge” the unreliability of wind/solar; and c) if oversupply happens, the resultant fossil fuel price collapse will apparently have no feedback effect, encouraging greater use. And those conclusions are reached collaterally with the assumption that there will be continued declines in global investment in fossil fuel exploration and infrastructures (see **Figure 14**).\\n\\nIn STEPS, while oil supply in 2035 is slightly higher than in 2023, the scenario assumes oil demand peaks by 2030, hence putting the world into oversupply. But if, as would be reasonable to model, demand were to continue to grow, then so must supply, which can come only from greater investment to maintain output from current fields and to find new sources of oil. The latter consideration is entirely absent from the NZE scenario, which assumes that no investment in new fields should take place.\\n\\nThe WEO concludes: “Existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure expansions set to come online over the next ten years *should provide* some buffer against potential outages and imply downward pressure on prices” (p. 29; emphasis added).\\n\\nFor policymakers and planners, it would be reasonable, even critical, to model the outcome of insufficient supply; a “should provide” conclusion is risky and flawed. A several mmbd shortfall in global oil supply can trigger inflation-inducing, even recession-inducing, price increases, not to mention political panic.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: The future decline rate from existing oil fields will continue historical trends*\\n\\nAll oil (and natural gas) fields experience a natural decline rate in output. This reality means that major ongoing investments are required to find and develop new oil fields wherein the single most important variable, i.e., assumption, is that decline rate. Nowhere in WEO is this issue discussed. The absence of scenarios with faster decline rates leads to overoptimistic outcomes regarding supply.\\n\\nThe IEA does mention the decline-rate issue in its (separate) medium-term oil report stating that the global average field decline rate is about 5%.50 An alternative view was provided in June 2023 by the Energy Policy Research Foundation, which estimated the global rate to be about 6%, an apparently small difference that nonetheless means 1 mmbd less supply than WEO models.51 Some major producing countries have higher decline rates: Brazil’s burgeoning offshore sector has a 13% decline rate, and the U.S. shale oil fields have an estimated annual decline rate of 28%.\\n\\nAnother significant and credible analysis of decline rates was provided in August 2024 by ExxonMobil. It pointed to a current and forecast overall rate of field decline of 15%.52 Exxon, of course, has significant direct experience with the issue as an operator in many countries and produces about 2.5 mmbd. Exxon concluded that “with no new investment, global oil supplies would fall by more than 15 million barrels per day in the first year alone. At that rate, by 2030, oil supplies would fall from 100 million barrels per day to less than 30 million—that’s 70 million barrels short of what’s needed to meet demand every day.”\\n\\nClearly, there will not be a “no new investment” world. However, except for the special case of the U.S. shale sector, investment remains below the 2014 level. This is partly explained by vastly improved discipline in capital and operating expenditures.\\n\\nA reasonable scenario would reflect the fact that investment in upstream oil and gas is likely to grow, not shrink, in the coming years, given the widespread belief in the international oil industry that demand will not fall sharply in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n#### *Flawed Assumption: OPEC will be a reliable cushion to manage oil-supply disruptions*\\n\\nAn important insurance policy for the supply side of the oil industry is the existence of a very large spare production capacity cushion. It is self-evident that unanticipated events, geopolitical crises, or natural calamities can lead to unexpected losses in global oil supply. The WEO appears, by default, to place a lot of faith in OPEC as the primary supplier of spare oil capacity: “If announced capacity additions by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) proceed, the level of demand growth in the STEPS would mean spare capacity rising to 8 mmbd to 2030” (p. 29).\\n\\nAccording to the IEA, members of the OPEC+ oil producers alliance are sitting on 5.6 mmbd of spare production following their decision to cut production to support prices.53 The OPEC+ alliance is composed of members of OPEC (excluding Iran, Venezuela, and Libya) plus Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman, Russia, Sudan, and South Sudan. Forecasting oil production policy for the OPEC+ alliance is always difficult.\\n\\nThe spare production cushion conveys huge power to the alliance. Creating a bigger cushion by reducing production is unlikely in the near term. In either case, sensible models would include the impacts of a smaller “cushion.”\\n\\n## Endnotes\\n\\n## Stay Tuned\\n\\n“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”\\n\\n![NCEA Logo](//energyanalytics.org/wp-content/themes/energyanalytics/images/logo-stacked.svg?v=1718393695)\\n\\nCopyright 2025 National Center for Energy Analytics  \\nAll Rights Reserved  \\n[Privacy Policy](https://energyanalytics.org/privacy/)\\n\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\"\n",

These energy transition scenarios examine outcomes ranging from warming of 1.6°C to 2.9°C by 2100 (scenario descriptions outlined below in sidebar “About the Global Energy Perspective 2023”). These wide-ranging scenarios sketch a range of outcomes based on varying underlying assumptions—for example, about the pace of technological progress and the level of policy enforcement. The scenarios are shaped by more than 400 drivers across sectors, technologies, policies, costs, and fuels, and serve as a fact base to inform decision makers on the challenges to be overcome to enable the energy transition.\\n\\nSidebar\\n\\nAbout the authors\\n-----------------\\n\\nThis article is a collaborative effort by [Luciano Di Fiori](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/luciano-di-fiori), Cherry Ding, Enrico Furnari, [Micah Smith](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/micah-smith), and Pawel Wilczynski, representing views from McKinsey Energy Solutions.\\n\\nGrowing global momentum could accelerate the energy transition, as demonstrated by the UAE Consensus, released in December 2023, that calls on Parties to make a just and orderly transition away from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, analysis from multiple sources, including the IEA, IPCC, and McKinsey, suggests that conventional fossil fuels are likely to remain a part of the energy mix to 2050, even in a 1.5° pathway, and may act as a bridge for an orderly transition. Therefore, decarbonizing the fossil fuel system and substantially reducing emissions, including methane, is a key area of focus. Within that evolving context, this article examines the potential road ahead for oil according to our sector-based adoption models.

According to our analysis,[1 To assess the different paths forward, McKinsey has established sector-based adoption models, in which it analyses model sector- and country-based adoption speeds of new technologies given a range of underlying insights and assumptions. These include existing and expected regulation, costs, asset lifetimes, supply chains, technological learning curves, and economic optimization as a system.](javascript:void(0);) demand could fall by up to 50 percent by 2050, depending on the scenario modelled. However, even under the most accelerated scenario, the analysis shows that investment in a broad energy mix, including oil and gas, would continue for a period in order to shore-up security of supply and meet demand across the range of scenarios, particularly in end-use sectors such as chemicals, aviation, and heavy trucking. As a result, our bottom-up energy transition scenarios consistently see a certain amount of new field development continuing in order to meet overall energy demand, offset rapid production declines, and to meet transition energy shortfalls. Furthermore, our scenarios see investment in the oil and gas sector, both for fuel and non-fuel purposes, remaining robust through 2030 as the world navigates an orderly and affordable transition.\\n\\nGrowing energy efficiency and EV uptake could advance the timeline for oil demand decline\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter a steep decline due to COVID-19, oil demand increased to pre-pandemic levels in 2023 at 101.7 million barrels per day (MMb/d). However, growth may not last long, as peak demand is projected to materialize before 2030 across our four bottom-up energy transition scenarios.\\n\\nThe four scenarios align on a relatively close timing of peak oil demand between 2025 and 2030, driven by efficiency gains across sectors and growing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in passenger cars. Energy efficiency (including electrification) spending made up two-thirds of overall government investments in clean energy in the last two years, and the continued electrification of transport has contributed significantly to the reduced demand for oil.[1 _Energy Efficiency 2022_, International Energy Agency, 2022.](javascript:void(0);) In particular, growing uptake of EVs is expected to contribute to between 5 and 10 MMb/d of oil demand reduction by 2030, and is the major differentiating driver of peak demand between scenarios.\\n\\n![Image 2: Oil demand is expected to peak by 2030 across all scenarios, with a wide variation of 2050 demand.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex1.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Demand in the light-duty segment would decline across all scenarios as the proportion of EVs among cars on the road reaches between 55 and 80 percent by 2050, contributing to a decline in oil demand by 2050 of between 15 and 25 MMb/d.\\n\\nHeavy transport (such as long-haul duty trucks) could have a more uncertain outlook. While demand in this segment would continue to grow in the Fading Momentum scenario, advancements in both battery technology and hydrogen could enable large-scale decarbonization in the Achieved Commitments scenario, resulting in a decline of around 10 MMb/d compared to today.\\n\\nOn the other hand, despite the expected overall decline in global oil demand by 2050, our analysis shows that oil could still provide considerable supply to end-use sectors, such as aviation and chemicals, where decarbonization options, such as [sustainable fuels](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/global-energy-perspective-2023-sustainable-fuels-outlook), are not yet cost competitive in many cases, or where oil is used as a feedstock instead of as a fuel. In fact, chemicals and aviation are the only sectors where demand continues to grow to 2050 in all our bottom-up energy transition scenarios, driven by increased demand for plastic and travel, respectively. These sectors could account for almost 50 percent of global oil demand by 2050 (compared to around 22 percent today).\\n\\nHowever, in the Achieved Commitments scenario, up to 50 percent of aviation demand would be supplied by bio- and syn-kerosene, which have low or zero emissions due to the sequestered carbon in the production process.\\n\\n![Image 3: Road transport is the largest contributor to the oil demand decline, with demand in chemicals and aviation continuing to grow.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex2-v14.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

This would happen even sooner under the Achieved Commitments scenario assumptions.\\n\\nFor any new capital expenditure in oil, parties will need to consider actions to enable a just and orderly transition away from fossil fuels in the coming decades and accelerate efforts globally towards net zero-emission energy systems, utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century.\\n\\nGiven the fact that it accounts for around 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the oil and gas industry can play an important role in reducing emissions, mostly notably in methane reduction, which represents around 45 percent of all oil and gas emissions globally and generates a temperature impact that is 80 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year timeframe.[4 International Energy Agency; UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.](javascript:void(0);) There has recently been acceleration in this area; for example, the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), launched at COP28 in December 2023, commits signatories to achieving net-zero operations by 2050 across Scope one and two emissions, near-zero methane in upstream operations by 2030, and zero routine flaring by 2030.\\n\\nThe oil supply mix is projected to shift\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nLooking in detail at the Current Trajectory scenario, the supply mix would shift to three main sources under the assumptions of that scenario:\\n\\n*   OPEC Middle East would continue to hold low-cost reserves, with a broadly flat output. The region produces the lowest-cost oil, and key players favor long-term market stability.\\n*   Shale oil would add 17 percent to the 2022 baseline (1.7 MMb/d), plateauing in the 2030s.\\n*   Deepwater output would grow by 12 percent compared to the 2022 baseline and peak before 2040, unless significant discoveries are made (such as in Guyana, Namibia, and Suriname), despite the overall shrinking trend in offshore output. In offshore, deepwater is likely to see the most growth.\\n\\nEffectively, 24 MMb/d of yet unsanctioned production outside of OPEC Middle East would be needed to meet 2040 supply projections under our Current Trajectory scenario, with nearly 21 MMb/d coming from shale and offshore assets. These increases would be offset by reductions in other conventional and shallow water reservoirs, resulting in lower supply by 2040 to meet lower demand.\\n\\n![Image 4: By 2040, the supply mix is projected to shift to OPEC Middle East, shale oil, and deepwater output.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex4.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

The outlook is driven predominantly by the Permian Basin, where production is expected to grow through the mid-2030s before potentially plateauing at around 7 MMb/d by 2040.\\n\\nThree factors could impact the future growth of North American shale production:\\n\\n*   The capital discipline of public operators and uncertainty around future long-term consistency.\\n*   Potential energy transition trends and local policy impacting supply growth.\\n*   Permian Basin productivity gains, which represent a major driver of production growth, and which have begun to plateau.\\n\\n![Image 5: North America shale oil production is expected to plateau at approximately 10MMb/d, driven by the Permian Basin.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex17-v3_ex5.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: [McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com](mailto:McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com)\\n\\nThe evolution of oil demand would impact future prices\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe price dynamics that oil could see in the short and longer terms is an important consideration for the energy transition. Under the Current Trajectory scenario, based on fundamental analysis of currently identified resources, the market is projected to reach a long-term price equilibrium in 2040 within a range of $50 to $60 per barrel ($ real, 2022), or $90 to $100 per barrel (nominal). Marginal production is expected from offshore deepwater projects. This assumes production restraint by lowest cost producers, which in some cases see break-evens of around $10 per barrel.\\n\\nHence, given the wide range of demand scenarios and price outlooks, oil and gas companies may have to carefully manage decline in demand to avoid the risk of stranded assets, while at the same time ensuring that they are future-proofed with investments in energy transition opportunities, as many have already started doing.\\n\\n![Image 6: Demand is projected to decline by around 10 MMb/d by 2040 in the Current Trajectory scenario, allowing the market to balance at $50-60/bbl.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/global%20energy%20perspective%202023/oil%20outlook/svgz-gep-oil-ex6-v20.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Despite this cumulative increase, annual demand growth is expected to shrivel from 2.4 mb/d this year to just 0.4 mb/d in 2028, putting a peak in demand in sight.\\n\\nIn particular, the use of oil for transport fuels is set to go into decline after 2026 as the expansion of electric vehicles, the growth of biofuels and improving fuel economy reduce consumption.\\n\\n“The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Oil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition.”\\n\\nGlobal oil markets are still slowly recalibrating after three turbulent years in which they were upended first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The global energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine has resulted in an unprecedented reshuffling of global trade flows. Global oil markets could tighten significantly in the coming months, as production cuts by the OPEC+ alliance temper an upswing in global oil supplies. However, the multifaceted strains on markets look set to ease in the following years, according to the new report.\\n\\nChina was the last major economy to lift its stringent Covid-19 restrictions at the end of 2022, leading to a post-pandemic oil demand rebound in the first half of 2023. But demand growth in China is forecast to slow markedly from 2024 onwards. Nevertheless, burgeoning petrochemical demand and strong consumption growth in emerging and developing economies will more than offset a contraction in advanced economies.\\n\\nGlobal upstream investments in oil and gas exploration, extraction and production are on course to reach their highest levels since 2015, growing 11% year-on-year to USD 528 billion in 2023. While the impact of higher spending will be partly offset by cost inflation, this level of investment, if sustained, would be adequate to meet forecast demand in the period covered by the report. However, it exceeds the amount that would be needed in a world that gets on track for net zero emissions.\\n\\nThe report’s projections assume major oil producers maintain their plans to build up capacity even as demand growth slows. This is expected to result in a spare capacity cushion of at least 3.8 mb/d, concentrated in the Middle East. The report nonetheless notes a number of factors that could affect market balances over the medium term – including uncertain global economic trends, the direction of OPEC+ decisions and China’s refining industry policy.\\n\\nOil producing countries outside the OPEC+ alliance dominate plans for increasing global supply capacity in the medium term, with an expected rise of 5.1 mb/d by 2028 led by the United States, Brazil and Guyana. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq lead the plans for capacity building within OPEC+, while African and Asian members are set to struggle with continuing declines, and Russian production falls due to sanctions. This makes for a net capacity gain of 0.8 mb/d from the 23 members in OPEC+ overall over the report’s forecast period.\\n\\nIn the refining sector, the overhang in global capacity has been reduced by waves of closures, conversions to biofuel plants and project delays since the pandemic. This, combined with a sharp drop in Chinese oil product exports and an upheaval of Russian trade flows, resulted in record profits for the industry last year. While the amount of net refinery capacity additions by 2028 is expected to outpace demand growth for refined products, diverging trends among products means that a repeat of the 2022 tightness in middle distillates cannot be ruled out.\\n\\n##### Oil 2023\\n\\n[Explore report](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2023)\\n\\n###### The Energy Mix\\n\\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n[View sample](https://iea.li/energy-mix-sample) [Explore our other newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\n\\n*   Browse\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\n*   [Countries & regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\n\\n*   Explore\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\n*   [Data & statistics](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)\\n\\n*   Learn\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\n\\n*   Connect\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\n\\n*   Follow\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\n\\n©IEA 2025\\n\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028#header)\\n\\n#### Subscription successful\\n\\nThank you for subscribing.

Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5. [...] Growth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. [...] Divergent regional economic trajectories and the accelerating deployment of clean and energy-saving technologies are combining to progressively slow the pace of oil demand growth, with a plateau emerging in the final years of our forecast, which runs to 2030. Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply.\",\n",

Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply.\\n\\nRising world oil supplies, led by non‑OPEC+ producers, are expected to surpass forecast demand from 2025 onwards. Mirroring demand’s break with long-term trends, a front-loaded build in oil production capacity is forecast to lose momentum and swing into contraction towards the end of our medium-term outlook. A surge in natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensates will account for 45% of new capacity increases over the forecast period. In a major shift in strategy, Saudi Arabia has put on hold its planned crude oil capacity increase and will now focus on expanding natural gas liquids and condensates, which aligns with its efforts to boost domestic gas supply. It may also reflect an acknowledgment of the rapidly building surplus in global crude oil production capacity. The rise of petrochemicals as the main pillar of global demand growth largely tracks the substantial increase in global supply of NGLs, which are instrumental in their production.\\n\\nAt the same time, these changes will also create new challenges for refiners as demand for refined products is displaced by non-refined products such as NGLs and biofuels. Non-refined fuels are set to capture a staggering three-quarters of projected global demand growth over the 2023-2030 period. Moreover, refiners will need to reconfigure their product slates to meet divergent trends for distillates amid reduced consumption as the energy transition accelerates. This is especially the case in road transport fuels as EVs rapidly increase their market share.\\n\\nAmid all these structural changes to supply and demand patterns, the global oil market outlook faces further uncertainties from weaker macroeconomic expectations, new government policies and regulations to fast-track the energy transition, and an unprecedented level of investment to scale up more efficient technologies.\\n\\nWhile the challenges are formidable, the industry has consistently proved its adaptability to dramatic supply and demand changes, including from the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic before that.\\n\\n#### Surplus global supply capacity will reach unprecedented levels by 2030\\n\\nA ramping up of world oil production capacity, led by the United States and other producers in the Americas, is expected to outstrip demand growth over the 2023‑2030 forecast period and inflate the world’s spare capacity cushion to levels that are unprecedented, barring the Covid-19 period. Total supply capacity rises by 6 mb/d to nearly 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a staggering 8 mb/d above projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d.\\n\\n### OPEC+ spare crude production capacity and implied total oil stock build, 2016-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/opec-spare-crude-production-capacity-and-implied-total-oil-stock-build-2016-2030)\\n\\nSuch a massive cushion could upend the current OPEC+ market management strategy aimed at supporting prices. For now, the producer alliance has laid out a roadmap for unwinding extra voluntary cuts of up to 2.2 mb/d from Q4 2024 to Q3 2025\\\\. But this outlook is subject to their caveat that the production increases can be paused or reversed depending on market conditions.\\n\\nA lower price environment would ultimately challenge the US shale industry, traditionally the fastest respondent to changing market circumstances. How the industry will adapt and adjust to the new supply landscape will have wide-ranging consequences for producers and consumers globally through the remainder of the decade and beyond.\\n\\n#### World oil demand tempered by clean energy transition\\n\\nBased on today’s market conditions and policies, global oil demand will level off at around 106 mb/d towards the end of the decade amid the accelerating transition to clean energy technologies. Surging EV sales and continued efficiency improvements of vehicles, and the substitution of oil with renewables or gas in the power sector, will significantly curb oil use in road transport and electricity generation.\\n\\nTotal oil demand is nevertheless forecast to rise by 3.2 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, supported by increased use of jet fuel and feedstocks from the booming petrochemical sector. Indeed, consumption of naphtha, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane will climb by 3.7 mb/d over the forecast period, fuelled also by growth in LPG use for clean cooking.\\n\\n### Global oil demand forecast, 2017-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-oil-demand-forecast-2017-2030)\\n\\n### Growth in oil demand, 2022-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/growth-in-oil-demand-2022-2030)\\n\\nGrowth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. Significant gains will also come from other emerging and developing economies in Asia. By contrast, demand in advanced economies will continue its decades-long decline, falling from 45.7 mb/d in 2023 to 42.7 mb/d by 2030\\\\. Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5.\\n\\n#### Upstream investments and oil supply on the rise\\n\\nIn line with the ascendancy of petrochemicals as the anchor of global oil demand growth, 45% of the supply capacity increase over the forecast period comes from NGLs and condensates. While Saudi Arabia has shelved its planned crude capacity increase from 12 mb/d to 13 mb/d, its development of the massive Jafurah gas field will move ahead. This will result in a substantial ramping up of gas liquids output of almost 1 mb/d by 2030, volumes that are not subject to OPEC+ quotas. Strong gains in US NGLs are also expected. Total NGLs and condensates are projected to rise by 2.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030. By comparison, crude oil production capacity is forecast to increase by 2.6 mb/d over the same period, while biofuels account for 620 kb/d of the 6 mb/d total.\\n\\nNon-OPEC+ producers will continue to lead the capacity build, accounting for 4.6 mb/d, or 76% of the net increase. The United States alone makes up 2.1 mb/d of the non-OPEC+ gains, while Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina contribute a further 2.7 mb/d. As the sanctioned project queue fizzles out towards the end of our forecast, growth stalls in the United States and Canada while Brazil and Guyana shift into decline based on current plans. However, should companies swiftly approve additional projects that are already on the drawing board, an incremental 1.3 mb/d of non‑OPEC+ capacity could become operational by 2030.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq lead a 1.4 mb/d rise in OPEC+ oil capacity as African and Asian members post declines. The UAE and Iraq are raising crude oil capacity while Saudi Arabia is poised for a significant increase NGL and condensates supply. Capacity in Russia is expected to show only a marginal decline despite international sanctions as the giant Vostok project ramps up, helping to offset losses at mature oil fields.\\n\\nThe boost in supply follows a steady increase in upstream investments. Global upstream capital expenditures rose by 13% to an eight-year high of USD 538 billion in 2023 and are on track to increase by another 7% this year.\\n\\n#### Refiners adjust to slowing demand for refined fuels\\n\\nGlobal refining capacity is forecast to rise by 3.3 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, well below historical trends. Even with the moderate expansion in capacity, the increase outpaces the call on refined products over the period.\\n\\nRefiners will need to progressively modify their product output to meet divergent trends for distillates as gasoline demand falls amid an increase in the market share of electric vehicles while jet fuel consumption rises. In addition, non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels further undermine demand for refined product supplies and the need for additional refining capacity. Non-refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of projected demand growth over the 2023-2030 period.\\n\\nThis significant rise in non-refinery product supplies will add pressure on operating rates and refinery profitability, especially in mature demand centres. That raises the prospect of further capacity closures by the end of the decade. Capacity growth will remain concentrated in Asia, most notably in China and India, but post‑2027 there are signs of expansions slowing.\\n\\n#### Global oil trade will continue its eastward shift\\n\\nGlobal oil trade will continue to be dictated by Asia’s growing structural shortfall in crude and product supply and the expanding surplus of crude, NGLs and products in the Atlantic Basin. Rising non-OPEC+ crude supply, in tandem with sanctions on Russian crude exports and OPEC+ voluntary cuts, will push higher volumes from the Atlantic Basin to East of Suez over the outlook period.\\n\\n### Net crude oil exports versus Asian import requirement, 2019-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/net-crude-oil-exports-versus-asian-import-requirement-2019-2030)\\n\\nThe loss of medium sour crudes from the Middle East amid OPEC+ cuts is partially offset by rising supplies from Brazil, Guyana and Canada. Asian markets have been opened in earnest to Canadian crude through the expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline to the Pacific Coast. Light sweet US crude oil will increasingly move to Europe and Africa as well as to India and other Asian refiners.\\n\\nAs the dominant centre of oil product demand growth, Asia will attract a greater share of product supply from the broader region, notably from the Middle East. Supplies from Russia, which are subject to sanctions in much of the Atlantic Basin, will continue to head eastward, although Africa and Latin America may also boost imports over time. Europe’s shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition most keenly in the middle distillate markets.\\n\\n###### The Energy Mix\\n\\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n[View sample](https://iea.li/energy-mix-sample) [Explore our other newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\n\\n*   Browse\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\n*   [Countries & regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\n\\n*   Explore\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\n*   [Data & statistics](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)\\n\\n*   Learn\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\n\\n*   Connect\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\n\\n*   Follow\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\n\\n©IEA 2025\\n\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024/executive-summary#header)\\n\\n#### Subscription successful\\n\\nThank you for subscribing.

      "The task is to gather authoritative and comprehensive data on global oil demand, including historical, current, and forecasted consumption up to 2045. This should include detailed country-level demand trends, highlighting significant increases or decreases with attention to major economies and developing nations. Projections should be presented under multiple scenarios such as baseline, high growth, and climate policy-driven cases. Quantitative metrics like barrels per day and growth rates must be included, covering past decades through mid-century, drawing from key agencies including the IEA, ExxonMobil, OPEC, and other energy organizations.\n",

      "# Research Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Global Oil Demand Overview and Forecasts to 2045\n",
      "\n",
      "- **IEA Outlook** shows global oil demand is expected to rise until about 2028-2030 and then plateau in the near term due to the accelerating clean energy transition (electric vehicles, efficiency improvements). Demand is projected at approximately 105-106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by the late 2020s. After this period, growth slows markedly, with a plateau or slight decline depending on scenario assumptions.\n",
      "- **OPEC Outlook** provides a more bullish forecast, projecting continuous growth in global oil demand through 2045, with demand reaching 116 million barrels per day by 2045, and further expanding to 120.1 mb/d by 2050. OPEC highlights demand growth driven primarily by developing countries due to increasing population, urbanization, and middle-class expansion. It asserts no peak demand on the horizon and expects combustion-engine vehicles to still represent over 70% of the global fleet by 2050.\n",
      "- **ExxonMobil Global Outlook** forecasts oil demand staying close to current levels (~100 mb/d) through 2050, with ongoing investment needed to maintain supply given decline rates in existing fields.\n",
      "- **McKinsey Global Energy Perspective 2023** indicates peak oil demand between 2025 and 2030 across all scenarios studied, driven by EV adoption and energy efficiency. Demand could decline by 10 mb/d by 2040 in the baseline scenario. However, demand for petrochemicals and aviation is expected to grow, offsetting some declines in transport fuels.\n",
      "- **US EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (2025)** projects global liquid fuels consumption increasing gradually beyond 2025, with growth focused on non-OECD countries (notably India and China). OECD demand remains flat or declines slightly. EIA expects a slow demand growth of 0.8 mb/d in 2025 and 1.1 mb/d in 2026.\n",
      "- The **Institute for Energy Research** critically reviews the IEA forecast, warning that the baseline IEA “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS) underestimates growth potential in emerging economies, and business-as-usual patterns may lead to substantially higher demand by 2035 and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Quantitative Metrics and Evolution\n",
      "\n",
      "- Current global oil consumption (circa 2023-25) is approximately 100-103 million barrels per day.\n",
      "- The **IEA 2023 report** forecasts cumulative growth of 6% from 2022 to 2028, peaking at ~105.7 mb/d.\n",
      "- OPEC projects a rise to 111 million b/d by 2028 and 116 million b/d by 2045.\n",
      "- Growth rates vary by region: Non-OECD Asia, especially India, is expected to lead growth; OECD consumption is declining.\n",
      "- Growth in petrochemical feedstocks, aviation fuels, and liquids like natural gas liquids (NGLs) contribute significantly to demand.\n",
      "- EV adoption is modeled to displace up to 5-10 mb/d of oil demand by 2030, but EV penetration rates vary dramatically by region.\n",
      "- Refinery capacity is expanding moderately but may outpace refined product demand growth, requiring refiners to adapt to product mix changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Country and Regional Demand Trends\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Major Growing Countries**: India shows strong transport fuel demand growth, overtaking China by around 2027 in incremental oil demand growth. China’s growth is primarily petrochemicals-driven, with declining transport fuel demand due to increased rail investments and EV adoption.\n",
      "- **China**: Post-pandemic oil rebound slows by mid-2020s; gasoline use may peak around 2024-2025.\n",
      "- **India**: Transport fuels expected to rise sharply due to vehicle fleet expansion and economic growth.\n",
      "- **US and OECD**: Oil demand largely flat or declining, driven by structural declines in transport fuel demand and efficiency gains, including EV uptake.\n",
      "- **Middle East**: Significant spare production capacity maintained, with power sector fuel switching affecting oil demand patterns.\n",
      "- **Africa and other developing regions**: Population growth and rising prosperity contribute to sustained demand increases.\n",
      "- **Russia**: Oil production and exports declining due to sanctions and departure of western companies.\n",
      "- **OPEC+**: Capacity increases expected mostly in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iraq; other OPEC+ members face decline or stagnation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Scenario Projections\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Baseline / Stated Policies Scenario (IEA STEPS)** assumes current policies and pledges are implemented. Leads to peak demand near 2028-2030.\n",
      "- **High Growth / Business as Usual Scenario** (critiqued by independent analysts) assumes continuation of past growth patterns in emerging markets. This would yield notably higher demand (possibly exceeding 120 million b/d by 2040 or later).\n",
      "- **Climate Policy / Net Zero Scenarios** forecast demand declines after early peak years, significant shares of oil demand displaced by EVs, biofuels, and alternative fuels, with outputs shrinking by mid-century. These predict demand falling towards 80-90 million b/d by 2045 or 2050.\n",
      "- OPEC scenarios differ significantly from other agencies, showing demand growing beyond 110 mb/d by 2030 and continuing upwards to 118.9-120.1 mb/d by 2045-2050, emphasizing slower EV adoption and persistent combustion engine vehicle prevalence.\n",
      "- ExxonMobil also shows sustained demand at current or slightly higher levels to 2050, requiring continued investment due to natural decline rates (~15% annual decline in fields).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Key Drivers Affecting Demand\n",
      "\n",

      "# Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Global oil demand is currently near historic highs (~100 mb/d) and is expected to grow moderately through the late 2020s. Leading agencies like the IEA project a peak or plateau of global demand around 2028-2030 at approximately 105-106 mb/d, largely due to efficiency improvements, EV adoption, and the energy transition. However, OPEC and some industry forecasts suggest a longer growth trajectory with demand reaching approximately 116 mb/d by 2045 driven predominantly by rising demand in emerging and developing economies such as India, Africa, and the Middle East, where energy transition adoption is slower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Country-level demand trends show strong growth in non-OECD Asia, India overtaking China in demand growth, and OECD countries generally exhibiting declining or flat demand. Key sectors that are growth drivers include petrochemicals and aviation, which offset some expected decline in passenger transport fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple scenarios vary significantly, from baseline and stated policy scenarios predicting near-term demand peaking, to high-growth scenarios projecting sustained increases in demand beyond 2040, and climate-driven scenarios expecting faster declines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the diversity of credible forecasts and uncertainties around technology adoption rates, policy implementation, and economic growth, it is prudent for policymakers and businesses to prepare for a range of outcomes, including continued demand growth in emerging markets for decades alongside structural declines in advanced economies.\n",

This should include detailed country-level demand trends, highlighting significant increases or decreases with attention to major economies and developing nations. Projections should be presented under multiple scenarios such as baseline, high growth, and climate policy-driven cases. Quantitative metrics like barrels per day and growth rates must be included, covering past decades through mid-century, drawing from key agencies including the IEA, ExxonMobil, OPEC, and other energy organizations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Research Findings\\n\\n## 1. Global Oil Demand Overview and Forecasts to 2045\\n\\n- **IEA Outlook** shows global oil demand is expected to rise until about 2028-2030 and then plateau in the near term due to the accelerating clean energy transition (electric vehicles, efficiency improvements). Demand is projected at approximately 105-106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by the late 2020s. After this period, growth slows markedly, with a plateau or slight decline depending on scenario assumptions.\\n- **OPEC Outlook** provides a more bullish forecast, projecting continuous growth in global oil demand through 2045, with demand reaching 116 million barrels per day by 2045, and further expanding to 120.1 mb/d by 2050. OPEC highlights demand growth driven primarily by developing countries due to increasing population, urbanization, and middle-class expansion. It asserts no peak demand on the horizon and expects combustion-engine vehicles to still represent over 70% of the global fleet by 2050.\\n- **ExxonMobil Global Outlook** forecasts oil demand staying close to current levels (~100 mb/d) through 2050, with ongoing investment needed to maintain supply given decline rates in existing fields.\\n- **McKinsey Global Energy Perspective 2023** indicates peak oil demand between 2025 and 2030 across all scenarios studied, driven by EV adoption and energy efficiency. Demand could decline by 10 mb/d by 2040 in the baseline scenario. However, demand for petrochemicals and aviation is expected to grow, offsetting some declines in transport fuels.\\n- **US EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (2025)** projects global liquid fuels consumption increasing gradually beyond 2025, with growth focused on non-OECD countries (notably India and China). OECD demand remains flat or declines slightly. EIA expects a slow demand growth of 0.8 mb/d in 2025 and 1.1 mb/d in 2026.\\n- The **Institute for Energy Research** critically reviews the IEA forecast, warning that the baseline IEA “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS) underestimates growth potential in emerging economies, and business-as-usual patterns may lead to substantially higher demand by 2035 and beyond.\\n\\n### Quantitative Metrics and Evolution\\n\\n- Current global oil consumption (circa 2023-25) is approximately 100-103 million barrels per day.\\n- The **IEA 2023 report** forecasts cumulative growth of 6% from 2022 to 2028, peaking at ~105.7 mb/d.\\n- OPEC projects a rise to 111 million b/d by 2028 and 116 million b/d by 2045.\\n- Growth rates vary by region: Non-OECD Asia, especially India, is expected to lead growth; OECD consumption is declining.\\n- Growth in petrochemical feedstocks, aviation fuels, and liquids like natural gas liquids (NGLs) contribute significantly to demand.\\n- EV adoption is modeled to displace up to 5-10 mb/d of oil demand by 2030, but EV penetration rates vary dramatically by region.\\n- Refinery capacity is expanding moderately but may outpace refined product demand growth, requiring refiners to adapt to product mix changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Country and Regional Demand Trends\\n\\n- **Major Growing Countries**: India shows strong transport fuel demand growth, overtaking China by around 2027 in incremental oil demand growth. China’s growth is primarily petrochemicals-driven, with declining transport fuel demand due to increased rail investments and EV adoption.\\n- **China**: Post-pandemic oil rebound slows by mid-2020s; gasoline use may peak around 2024-2025.\\n- **India**: Transport fuels expected to rise sharply due to vehicle fleet expansion and economic growth.\\n- **US and OECD**: Oil demand largely flat or declining, driven by structural declines in transport fuel demand and efficiency gains, including EV uptake.\\n- **Middle East**: Significant spare production capacity maintained, with power sector fuel switching affecting oil demand patterns.\\n- **Africa and other developing regions**: Population growth and rising prosperity contribute to sustained demand increases.\\n- **Russia**: Oil production and exports declining due to sanctions and departure of western companies.\\n- **OPEC+**: Capacity increases expected mostly in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iraq; other OPEC+ members face decline or stagnation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Scenario Projections\\n\\n- **Baseline / Stated Policies Scenario (IEA STEPS)** assumes current policies and pledges are implemented. Leads to peak demand near 2028-2030.\\n- **High Growth / Business as Usual Scenario** (critiqued by independent analysts) assumes continuation of past growth patterns in emerging markets. This would yield notably higher demand (possibly exceeding 120 million b/d by 2040 or later).\\n- **Climate Policy / Net Zero Scenarios** forecast demand declines after early peak years, significant shares of oil demand displaced by EVs, biofuels, and alternative fuels, with outputs shrinking by mid-century. These predict demand falling towards 80-90 million b/d by 2045 or 2050.\\n- OPEC scenarios differ significantly from other agencies, showing demand growing beyond 110 mb/d by 2030 and continuing upwards to 118.9-120.1 mb/d by 2045-2050, emphasizing slower EV adoption and persistent combustion engine vehicle prevalence.\\n- ExxonMobil also shows sustained demand at current or slightly higher levels to 2050, requiring continued investment due to natural decline rates (~15% annual decline in fields).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Key Drivers Affecting Demand\\n\\n- **EV adoption** is a critical factor in demand reduction, but penetration rates differ widely by country; affordability and infrastructure challenges constrain growth in developing nations.\\n- **Petrochemical sector** demands increasing volumes of oil and natural gas liquids as feedstocks; expected to grow faster than transport sector demand in some projections.\\n- **Aviation and heavy-duty transport** remain challenging sectors for replacement; demand in these sectors expected to increase or remain robust, offsetting some declines in passenger transport fuels.\\n- **Economic growth and population growth** in emerging and developing economies, particularly India, Africa, and Asia, drive sustained demand growth despite efficiency gains and energy transitions in developed world.\\n- **Energy Transition and Climate Policies** shape demand trajectories, affecting projections in mid to long-term scenarios.\\n- **Upstream investments** are increasing (IEA forecasts $528 billion in 2023, highest since 2015), to maintain supply amid natural field decline and production plateaus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Images\\n\\n![Projected Oil Demand Trajectory (IEA, OPEC, Others)](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4IHKIN3KARMJBPACDSANSNKTKA.png)\\n\\n![OPEC Long-Term Global Oil Demand Forecast to 2045](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/D4WWCXPOSVJADAYA55FYPPK27E.png)\\n\\n![Country-Level Capacity Growth and Demand Forecast (2022-2028)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)\\n\\n![Oil Demand Scenarios from Multiple Agencies (1990-2050)](https://www.crystolenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peak-oil-demand-2-1024x598.png)\\n\\n![Global Oil Demand Growth 2009-2019](http://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/30609.jpeg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nGlobal oil demand is currently near historic highs (~100 mb/d) and is expected to grow moderately through the late 2020s.

Europe’s shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition most keenly in the middle [...] Growth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply.

Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply.\\n\\nRising world oil supplies, led by non‑OPEC+ producers, are expected to surpass forecast demand from 2025 onwards. Mirroring demand’s break with long-term trends, a front-loaded build in oil production capacity is forecast to lose momentum and swing into contraction towards the end of our medium-term outlook. A surge in natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensates will account for 45% of new capacity increases over the forecast period. In a major shift in strategy, Saudi Arabia has put on hold its planned crude oil capacity increase and will now focus on expanding natural gas liquids and condensates, which aligns with its efforts to boost domestic gas supply. It may also reflect an acknowledgment of the rapidly building surplus in global crude oil production capacity. The rise of petrochemicals as the main pillar of global demand growth largely tracks the substantial increase in global supply of NGLs, which are instrumental in their production.\\n\\nAt the same time, these changes will also create new challenges for refiners as demand for refined products is displaced by non-refined products such as NGLs and biofuels. Non-refined fuels are set to capture a staggering three-quarters of projected global demand growth over the 2023-2030 period. Moreover, refiners will need to reconfigure their product slates to meet divergent trends for distillates amid reduced consumption as the energy transition accelerates. This is especially the case in road transport fuels as EVs rapidly increase their market share.\\n\\nAmid all these structural changes to supply and demand patterns, the global oil market outlook faces further uncertainties from weaker macroeconomic expectations, new government policies and regulations to fast-track the energy transition, and an unprecedented level of investment to scale up more efficient technologies.\\n\\nWhile the challenges are formidable, the industry has consistently proved its adaptability to dramatic supply and demand changes, including from the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic before that.\\n\\n#### Surplus global supply capacity will reach unprecedented levels by 2030\\n\\nA ramping up of world oil production capacity, led by the United States and other producers in the Americas, is expected to outstrip demand growth over the 2023‑2030 forecast period and inflate the world’s spare capacity cushion to levels that are unprecedented, barring the Covid-19 period. Total supply capacity rises by 6 mb/d to nearly 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a staggering 8 mb/d above projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d.\\n\\n### OPEC+ spare crude production capacity and implied total oil stock build, 2016-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/opec-spare-crude-production-capacity-and-implied-total-oil-stock-build-2016-2030)\\n\\nSuch a massive cushion could upend the current OPEC+ market management strategy aimed at supporting prices. For now, the producer alliance has laid out a roadmap for unwinding extra voluntary cuts of up to 2.2 mb/d from Q4 2024 to Q3 2025\\\\. But this outlook is subject to their caveat that the production increases can be paused or reversed depending on market conditions.\\n\\nA lower price environment would ultimately challenge the US shale industry, traditionally the fastest respondent to changing market circumstances. How the industry will adapt and adjust to the new supply landscape will have wide-ranging consequences for producers and consumers globally through the remainder of the decade and beyond.\\n\\n#### World oil demand tempered by clean energy transition\\n\\nBased on today’s market conditions and policies, global oil demand will level off at around 106 mb/d towards the end of the decade amid the accelerating transition to clean energy technologies. Surging EV sales and continued efficiency improvements of vehicles, and the substitution of oil with renewables or gas in the power sector, will significantly curb oil use in road transport and electricity generation.\\n\\nTotal oil demand is nevertheless forecast to rise by 3.2 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, supported by increased use of jet fuel and feedstocks from the booming petrochemical sector. Indeed, consumption of naphtha, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane will climb by 3.7 mb/d over the forecast period, fuelled also by growth in LPG use for clean cooking.\\n\\n### Global oil demand forecast, 2017-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-oil-demand-forecast-2017-2030)\\n\\n### Growth in oil demand, 2022-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/growth-in-oil-demand-2022-2030)\\n\\nGrowth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high‑speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. Significant gains will also come from other emerging and developing economies in Asia. By contrast, demand in advanced economies will continue its decades-long decline, falling from 45.7 mb/d in 2023 to 42.7 mb/d by 2030\\\\. Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5.\\n\\n#### Upstream investments and oil supply on the rise\\n\\nIn line with the ascendancy of petrochemicals as the anchor of global oil demand growth, 45% of the supply capacity increase over the forecast period comes from NGLs and condensates. While Saudi Arabia has shelved its planned crude capacity increase from 12 mb/d to 13 mb/d, its development of the massive Jafurah gas field will move ahead. This will result in a substantial ramping up of gas liquids output of almost 1 mb/d by 2030, volumes that are not subject to OPEC+ quotas. Strong gains in US NGLs are also expected. Total NGLs and condensates are projected to rise by 2.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030. By comparison, crude oil production capacity is forecast to increase by 2.6 mb/d over the same period, while biofuels account for 620 kb/d of the 6 mb/d total.\\n\\nNon-OPEC+ producers will continue to lead the capacity build, accounting for 4.6 mb/d, or 76% of the net increase. The United States alone makes up 2.1 mb/d of the non-OPEC+ gains, while Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina contribute a further 2.7 mb/d. As the sanctioned project queue fizzles out towards the end of our forecast, growth stalls in the United States and Canada while Brazil and Guyana shift into decline based on current plans. However, should companies swiftly approve additional projects that are already on the drawing board, an incremental 1.3 mb/d of non‑OPEC+ capacity could become operational by 2030.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq lead a 1.4 mb/d rise in OPEC+ oil capacity as African and Asian members post declines. The UAE and Iraq are raising crude oil capacity while Saudi Arabia is poised for a significant increase NGL and condensates supply. Capacity in Russia is expected to show only a marginal decline despite international sanctions as the giant Vostok project ramps up, helping to offset losses at mature oil fields.\\n\\nThe boost in supply follows a steady increase in upstream investments. Global upstream capital expenditures rose by 13% to an eight-year high of USD 538 billion in 2023 and are on track to increase by another 7% this year.\\n\\n#### Refiners adjust to slowing demand for refined fuels\\n\\nGlobal refining capacity is forecast to rise by 3.3 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, well below historical trends. Even with the moderate expansion in capacity, the increase outpaces the call on refined products over the period.\\n\\nRefiners will need to progressively modify their product output to meet divergent trends for distillates as gasoline demand falls amid an increase in the market share of electric vehicles while jet fuel consumption rises. In addition, non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels further undermine demand for refined product supplies and the need for additional refining capacity. Non-refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of projected demand growth over the 2023-2030 period.\\n\\nThis significant rise in non-refinery product supplies will add pressure on operating rates and refinery profitability, especially in mature demand centres. That raises the prospect of further capacity closures by the end of the decade. Capacity growth will remain concentrated in Asia, most notably in China and India, but post‑2027 there are signs of expansions slowing.\\n\\n#### Global oil trade will continue its eastward shift\\n\\nGlobal oil trade will continue to be dictated by Asia’s growing structural shortfall in crude and product supply and the expanding surplus of crude, NGLs and products in the Atlantic Basin. Rising non-OPEC+ crude supply, in tandem with sanctions on Russian crude exports and OPEC+ voluntary cuts, will push higher volumes from the Atlantic Basin to East of Suez over the outlook period.\\n\\n### Net crude oil exports versus Asian import requirement, 2019-2030\\n\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/net-crude-oil-exports-versus-asian-import-requirement-2019-2030)\\n\\nThe loss of medium sour crudes from the Middle East amid OPEC+ cuts is partially offset by rising supplies from Brazil, Guyana and Canada. Asian markets have been opened in earnest to Canadian crude through the expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline to the Pacific Coast. Light sweet US crude oil will increasingly move to Europe and Africa as well as to India and other Asian refiners.\\n\\nAs the dominant centre of oil product demand growth, Asia will attract a greater share of product supply from the broader region, notably from the Middle East. Supplies from Russia, which are subject to sanctions in much of the Atlantic Basin, will continue to head eastward, although Africa and Latin America may also boost imports over time. Europe’s shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition most keenly in the middle distillate markets.\\n\\n###### The Energy Mix\\n\\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n[View sample](https://iea.li/energy-mix-sample) [Explore our other newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\n\\n*   Browse\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\n*   [Countries & regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\n\\n*   Explore\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\n*   [Data & statistics](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics)\\n\\n*   Learn\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\n\\n*   Connect\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\n\\n*   Follow\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\n\\n©IEA 2025\\n\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\n\\n[](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024/executive-summary#header)\\n\\n#### Subscription successful\\n\\nThank you for subscribing.

      "    \"content\": \"World oil demand growth is set to accelerate from 840 kb/d in 2024 to 1.1 mb/d next year, lifting consumption to 103.9 mb/d in 2025. Increases in both years will be dominated by petrochemical feedstocks, while demand for transport fuels will continue to be constrained by behavioural and technological progress. While non-OECD demand growth, notably in China, has slowed markedly, emerging Asia will continue to lead gains in 2024 and 2025. [...] Global oil supply rose by 130 kb/d m-o-m to 103.4 mb/d in November, up 230 kb/d y-o-y, on a continued recovery in Libyan and Kazakhstan output. Total oil supply is on track to increase by 630 kb/d this year and 1.9 mb/d in 2025, to 104.8 mb/d, even in the absence of unwinding of OPEC+ cuts. Non-OPEC+ supply rises by about 1.5 mb/d in both years, led by the United States, Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina. [...] OPEC+ crude oil production may still rise next year if Libya, South Sudan and Sudan can sustain production and as Kazakhstan’s 260 kb/d Tengiz expansion comes online. Globally, the bulk of supply growth will continue to be dominated by non-OPEC+ countries, with the US, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina adding more than 1.1 mb/d of crude oil and NGL output between them. The start-up of Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah gas project next year will also boost Saudi Arabia’s NGL supply.\",\n",

Increases in both years will be dominated by petrochemical feedstocks, while demand for transport fuels will continue to be constrained by behavioural and technological progress. While non-OECD demand growth, notably in China, has slowed markedly, emerging Asia will continue to lead gains in 2024 and 2025.\\n*   Global oil supply rose by 130 kb/d m-o-m to 103.4 mb/d in November, up 230 kb/d y-o-y, on a continued recovery in Libyan and Kazakhstan output. Total oil supply is on track to increase by 630 kb/d this year and 1.9 mb/d in 2025, to 104.8 mb/d, even in the absence of unwinding of OPEC+ cuts. Non-OPEC+ supply rises by about 1.5 mb/d in both years, led by the United States, Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina.\\n*   Refinery throughputs will reach an annual peak of 84.3 mb/d in December, nearly 3 mb/d more than in October when maintenance and economic run cuts constrained activity. Crude runs will average 82.7 mb/d in 2024 and 83.3 mb/d in 2025, up by 520 kb/d and 620 kb/d, respectively. Margins improved in Asia in November as middle distillate cracks strengthened, but lower gasoline and naphtha values muted them in the Atlantic Basin.\\n*   Global observed oil inventories drew by 39.3 mb in October, led by an exceptionally sharp decline in oil products (-82.3 mb) as low refinery activity coincided with a rise in global oil demand. OECD industry stocks declined by 30.9 mb to 2 778 mb, 91.6 mb below the five-year average. Preliminary data for November show global inventories rebounded, led by oil on water and non-OECD crude oil.\\n*   Benchmark crude oil futures were largely unchanged in November, at around $73/bbl for ICE Brent. Prices traded in a relatively narrow $5/bbl range, as concerns oscillated between oil supply security and faltering oil demand growth. Volatility slumped to six-month lows, with the front-month Brent futures moving by a daily $0.87/bbl on average during November.  \\n    \\n\\n#### An uneasy calm\\n\\nThe decision by OPEC+ to delay the unwinding of its additional voluntary production cuts by another three months and extend the ramp-up period by nine months through September 2026 has materially reduced the potential supply overhang that was set to emerge next year. Even so, persistent overproduction from some OPEC+ members, robust supply growth from non-OPEC+ countries and relatively modest global oil demand growth leaves the market looking comfortably supplied in 2025.\\n\\nMinisters of the eight OPEC+ countries that had agreed extra output reductions of 2.2 mb/d in November 2023 confirmed at last week’s meeting a further delay in restoring these volumes to the market. The postponement was the third since September and came against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions that have raised potential supply risks and slowing global oil demand growth led by China. The cuts will now, at the earliest, be phased out from the end of March 2025 through September 2026.\\n\\nYet the latest OPEC+ decision does not remove the uncertainty about when the unwinding of the cuts will actually start. In this context, our forecasts exclude a return to higher production quotas until a final phase-out timeline is confirmed. On that basis, our current market balances still indicate a 950 kb/d supply overhang in 2025. If OPEC+ does begin unwinding the voluntary cuts from the end of March 2025, this overhang would rise to 1.4 mb/d. A key uncertainty for the trajectory of OPEC+ crude supply remains the level of compliance with agreed targets, with our estimates showing collective output 680 kb/d above targets in November.\\n\\nOPEC+ crude oil production may still rise next year if Libya, South Sudan and Sudan can sustain production and as Kazakhstan’s 260 kb/d Tengiz expansion comes online. Globally, the bulk of supply growth will continue to be dominated by non-OPEC+ countries, with the US, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina adding more than 1.1 mb/d of crude oil and NGL output between them. The start-up of Saudi Aramco’s Jafurah gas project next year will also boost Saudi Arabia’s NGL supply.\\n\\nWhile the market is closely assessing ongoing geopolitical tensions and evolving OPEC+ supply dynamics, the bigger question for 2025 remains global oil demand. The abrupt halt to Chinese oil demand growth this year – along with sharply lower increases in other notable emerging and developing economies such as Nigeria, Pakistan, Indonesia, South Africa and Argentina – has tilted consensus towards a softer outlook. In a break from recent trends, non-OECD oil demand in 3Q24 was up only 320 kb/d y-o-y, its lowest quarterly growth rate since the height of the pandemic, while OECD countries posted an increase of 190 kb/d y-o-y in the same quarter.\\n\\nThe relatively subdued pace of global oil demand growth is set to continue in 2025, accelerating only modestly from 840 kb/d in 2024 to 1.1 mb/d, with overall consumption reaching 103.9 mb/d. Additional demand for crude or refined products could come from discretionary inventory builds to bring industry stocks back in line with historical averages and as governments replenish strategic reserves. As the year draws to a close, oil markets appear relatively calm, with crude oil trading in a $70-75/bbl range. But, as recent years have shown, market shocks can arrive with little or no warning, making close attention to oil security as important as ever.\\n\\n**OPEC+ crude oil production**1  \\n_million barrels per day_\\n\\n|  | **Oct 2024  \\nSupply** | **Nov 2024  \\nSupply** | **Nov 2024  \\nvs Target** | **Nov-2024  \\nImplied Target1** | **Sustainable  \\nCapacity2** | **Eff Spare Cap  \\nvs Nov3** |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Algeria | 0.9 | 0.9 | \\\\-0.0 | 0.91 | 0.99 | 0.08 |\\n| Congo | 0.26 | 0.24 | \\\\-0.04 | 0.28 | 0.27 | 0.03 |\\n| Equatorial Guinea | 0.05 | 0.06 | \\\\-0.01 | 0.07 | 0.06 | 0.0 |\\n| Gabon | 0.23 | 0.23 | 0.06 | 0.17 | 0.22 | \\\\-0.01 |\\n| Iraq | 4.25 | 4.2 | 0.3 | 3.9 | 4.87 | 0.67 |\\n| Kuwait | 2.49 | 2.48 | 0.07 | 2.41 | 2.88 | 0.4 |\\n| Nigeria | 1.33 | 1.34 | \\\\-0.16 | 1.5 | 1.42 | 0.08 |\\n| Saudi Arabia | 9.04 | 9.04 | 0.07 | 8.98 | 12.11 | 3.07 |\\n| UAE | 3.23 | 3.24 | 0.33 | 2.91 | 4.28 | 1.03 |\\n| **Total OPEC-94** | **21.79** | **21.74** | **0.61** | **21.13** | **27.1** | **5.36** |\\n| Iran5 | 3.35 | 3.4 |  |  | 3.8 |  |\\n| Libya5 | 0.96 | 1.18 |  |  | 1.23 | 0.05 |\\n| Venezuela5 | 0.92 | 0.89 |  |  | 0.89 | 0.0 |\\n| **Total OPEC** | **27.03** | **27.21** |  |  | **33.02** | **5.41** |\\n| Azerbaijan | 0.48 | 0.48 | \\\\-0.07 | 0.55 | 0.49 | 0.01 |\\n| Kazakhstan | 1.32 | 1.45 | 0.02 | 1.44 | 1.62 | 0.17 |\\n| Mexico6 | 1.53 | 1.53 |  |  | 1.59 | 0.05 |\\n| Oman | 0.76 | 0.76 | 0.0 | 0.76 | 0.85 | 0.09 |\\n| Russia | 9.26 | 9.25 | 0.27 | 8.98 | 9.76 |  |\\n| Others 7 | 0.71 | 0.71 | \\\\-0.15 | 0.87 | 0.86 | 0.14 |\\n| **Total Non-OPEC** | **14.06** | **14.19** | **0.07** | **12.59** | **15.16** | **0.46** |\\n| **OPEC+ 18 in Nov 2022 deal5** | **34.32** | **34.4** | **0.68** | **33.72** | **40.67** | **5.77** |\\n| **Total OPEC+** | **41.09** | **41.4** |  |  | **48.18** | **5.87** |\\n\\n1\\\\.

      "\n",
      "## Problem Statement\n",
      "\n",
      "Research and synthesize qualitative and quantitative data on global oil demand trends influenced by country-specific and industry-specific factors. Explore technological advancements, policy/regulatory shifts, economic growth, behavioral changes, and sector-specific dynamics impacting oil consumption. Include alternative perspectives, risks, and uncertainties affecting outlooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Research Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Global Oil Demand Growth and Regional Dynamics\n",
      "\n",
      "- Global oil demand is projected to rise moderately through the late 2020s until around 2030 before plateauing due to accelerating clean energy transitions. Demand growth is estimated to reach roughly 106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2030 with subsequent stabilization.\n",
      "- Asia, especially emerging economies China and India, dominates demand growth. India is experiencing sharp transport fuel demand increases driven by rising vehicle fleets and economic growth, defying the global downward trend in transport fuel consumption.\n",
      "- China’s growth is more petrochemical-sector-driven as infrastructure investments and EV adoption blunt transport fuel demand growth.\n",
      "- In advanced economies (OECD), oil demand declines consistently due to efficiency gains, EV uptake, and structural changes in transport behavior.\n",
      "- Africa and other developing regions show sustained demand increases as population growth and prosperity rise.\n",
      "- Non-OECD Asia continues leading gains in both 2024-2025 and beyond, though China’s rapid demand growth has slowed notably.\n",
      "- The growth is mainly in petrochemical feedstocks, jet fuel, and natural gas liquids (NGLs); meanwhile, demand for conventional transport fuels is constrained by technology and behavioral changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Technological Advances Impacting Oil Demand\n",
      "\n",
      "- Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption is a key disrupter to traditional oil-based transport fuels. EV market share growth is rapid especially in OECD countries but slower in emerging markets due to infrastructure and affordability barriers.\n",
      "- Improved fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines reduces gasoline and diesel demand per vehicle.\n",
      "- Expansion of high-speed rail and other public transport infrastructure, particularly in China and some developed nations, reduces oil demand for passenger vehicles.\n",
      "- Growth in petrochemical feedstock demand maintains overall oil demand despite transport fuel declines, supported by rising consumption of naphtha, LPG, and ethane.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Policy and Regulatory Influences\n",
      "\n",
      "- Climate policies including carbon pricing, emissions reduction targets, and mandates for clean energy uptake are shaping oil demand trajectories especially in advanced economies.\n",
      "- Regulatory measures to promote EV adoption, fuel efficiency standards, and biofuel blending targets accelerate displacement of oil in transportation.\n",
      "- Energy transition policies also influence refinery operations by altering the mix of fuels refined and favoring biofuels or NGLs over traditional gasoline and diesel.\n",
      "- Government strategic reserves replenishments and policies on inventory management add variability to short-term demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Sector-Specific Demand Drivers\n",
      "\n",
      "- Transportation remains the largest oil demand sector, but the pattern is shifting:\n",
      "  - Road transport fuel demand is declining or plateauing in most advanced economies.\n",
      "  - Aviation fuel demand is growing steadily, considered harder to replace with alternatives, sustaining oil demand.\n",
      "  - Petrochemical sector demand rises significantly, often offsetting declines in transport fuel consumption.\n",
      "  - Heavy-duty transport and shipping remain challenging sectors for decarbonization, continuing to consume oil products robustly.\n",
      "- Industrial and buildings sectors are seeing some reductions through efficiency improvements and fuel switching but still contribute significantly to oil demand in developing economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Economic Growth and Behavioral Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "- Economic growth and rising middle classes in Asia, Africa, and Latin America underpin sustained increases in oil demand.\n",
      "- Urbanization and vehicle fleet expansions, especially in populous developing countries, drive oil consumption upward.\n",
      "- Behavioral shifts including telecommuting, modal shifts to greener transport, and greater energy consciousness contribute to demand moderation in some markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Energy Transition and Supply-Side Developments\n",
      "\n",
      "- Production capacity is expanding globally, particularly outside OPEC+, with the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Guyana, and Argentina leading supply growth.\n",
      "- Saudi Arabia and the UAE focus increasing capacity on NGLs and condensates aligned with gas projects, reflecting downstream changes.\n",
      "- Refiners face challenges adapting to declining gasoline demand and growing non-refined fuel products.\n",
      "- Non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels capture the majority of projected demand growth through 2030.\n",
      "- Market uncertainties include potential impacts of geopolitical tensions, compliance with production targets, and changing macroeconomic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. Alternative Views and Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "- Some experts critique mainstream projections, suggesting that rapid EV adoption may be hampered by affordability and infrastructure availability in emerging markets, leading to prolonged demand growth.\n",
      "- Risks include policy disruptions, economic slowdowns or accelerations, technological breakthroughs, and geopolitical shocks influencing both demand and supply.\n",
      "- The disparity between official forecasts (e.g., IEA, OPEC) reflects uncertainties around adoption rates of clean technologies and persistency of combustion-engine vehicles in developing countries.\n",
      "- Investment in upstream oil remains robust due to field decline rates and to meet enduring global demand, despite climate policy pressures.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The global oil consumption landscape is being reshaped by a complex interplay of technological, economic, regulatory, and behavioral factors. Emerging economies, particularly in Asia and Africa, are driving the growth in oil demand, while advanced economies show declining or stable consumption due to efficiency gains and greater EV adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technological progress in EVs and fuel efficiency, alongside clean energy policies, are displacing oil demand mainly in road transport. Nonetheless, sectors such as petrochemicals, aviation, and heavy-duty transport continue to sustain oil consumption. The rise of non-refined liquids and petrochemical feedstock demand, alongside expanding upstream production capacity outside OPEC+, is reshaping supply dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy frameworks, economic growth patterns, and technology adoption rates remain critical uncertainties with risks that could accelerate or delay peak oil demand. Future outlooks must consider diverse regional realities and sectoral developments, preparing for a range of scenarios from moderate plateauing to sustained growth in emerging markets.\n",

This should include detailed country-level demand trends, highlighting significant increases or decreases with attention to major economies and developing nations. Projections should be presented under multiple scenarios such as baseline, high growth, and climate policy-driven cases. Quantitative metrics like barrels per day and growth rates must be included, covering past decades through mid-century, drawing from key agencies including the IEA, ExxonMobil, OPEC, and other energy organizations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Research Findings\\n\\n## 1. Global Oil Demand Overview and Forecasts to 2045\\n\\n- **IEA Outlook** shows global oil demand is expected to rise until about 2028-2030 and then plateau in the near term due to the accelerating clean energy transition (electric vehicles, efficiency improvements). Demand is projected at approximately 105-106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by the late 2020s. After this period, growth slows markedly, with a plateau or slight decline depending on scenario assumptions.\\n- **OPEC Outlook** provides a more bullish forecast, projecting continuous growth in global oil demand through 2045, with demand reaching 116 million barrels per day by 2045, and further expanding to 120.1 mb/d by 2050. OPEC highlights demand growth driven primarily by developing countries due to increasing population, urbanization, and middle-class expansion. It asserts no peak demand on the horizon and expects combustion-engine vehicles to still represent over 70% of the global fleet by 2050.\\n- **ExxonMobil Global Outlook** forecasts oil demand staying close to current levels (~100 mb/d) through 2050, with ongoing investment needed to maintain supply given decline rates in existing fields.\\n- **McKinsey Global Energy Perspective 2023** indicates peak oil demand between 2025 and 2030 across all scenarios studied, driven by EV adoption and energy efficiency. Demand could decline by 10 mb/d by 2040 in the baseline scenario. However, demand for petrochemicals and aviation is expected to grow, offsetting some declines in transport fuels.\\n- **US EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (2025)** projects global liquid fuels consumption increasing gradually beyond 2025, with growth focused on non-OECD countries (notably India and China). OECD demand remains flat or declines slightly. EIA expects a slow demand growth of 0.8 mb/d in 2025 and 1.1 mb/d in 2026.\\n- The **Institute for Energy Research** critically reviews the IEA forecast, warning that the baseline IEA “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS) underestimates growth potential in emerging economies, and business-as-usual patterns may lead to substantially higher demand by 2035 and beyond.\\n\\n### Quantitative Metrics and Evolution\\n\\n- Current global oil consumption (circa 2023-25) is approximately 100-103 million barrels per day.\\n- The **IEA 2023 report** forecasts cumulative growth of 6% from 2022 to 2028, peaking at ~105.7 mb/d.\\n- OPEC projects a rise to 111 million b/d by 2028 and 116 million b/d by 2045.\\n- Growth rates vary by region: Non-OECD Asia, especially India, is expected to lead growth; OECD consumption is declining.\\n- Growth in petrochemical feedstocks, aviation fuels, and liquids like natural gas liquids (NGLs) contribute significantly to demand.\\n- EV adoption is modeled to displace up to 5-10 mb/d of oil demand by 2030, but EV penetration rates vary dramatically by region.\\n- Refinery capacity is expanding moderately but may outpace refined product demand growth, requiring refiners to adapt to product mix changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Country and Regional Demand Trends\\n\\n- **Major Growing Countries**: India shows strong transport fuel demand growth, overtaking China by around 2027 in incremental oil demand growth. China’s growth is primarily petrochemicals-driven, with declining transport fuel demand due to increased rail investments and EV adoption.\\n- **China**: Post-pandemic oil rebound slows by mid-2020s; gasoline use may peak around 2024-2025.\\n- **India**: Transport fuels expected to rise sharply due to vehicle fleet expansion and economic growth.\\n- **US and OECD**: Oil demand largely flat or declining, driven by structural declines in transport fuel demand and efficiency gains, including EV uptake.\\n- **Middle East**: Significant spare production capacity maintained, with power sector fuel switching affecting oil demand patterns.\\n- **Africa and other developing regions**: Population growth and rising prosperity contribute to sustained demand increases.\\n- **Russia**: Oil production and exports declining due to sanctions and departure of western companies.\\n- **OPEC+**: Capacity increases expected mostly in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iraq; other OPEC+ members face decline or stagnation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Scenario Projections\\n\\n- **Baseline / Stated Policies Scenario (IEA STEPS)** assumes current policies and pledges are implemented. Leads to peak demand near 2028-2030.\\n- **High Growth / Business as Usual Scenario** (critiqued by independent analysts) assumes continuation of past growth patterns in emerging markets. This would yield notably higher demand (possibly exceeding 120 million b/d by 2040 or later).\\n- **Climate Policy / Net Zero Scenarios** forecast demand declines after early peak years, significant shares of oil demand displaced by EVs, biofuels, and alternative fuels, with outputs shrinking by mid-century. These predict demand falling towards 80-90 million b/d by 2045 or 2050.\\n- OPEC scenarios differ significantly from other agencies, showing demand growing beyond 110 mb/d by 2030 and continuing upwards to 118.9-120.1 mb/d by 2045-2050, emphasizing slower EV adoption and persistent combustion engine vehicle prevalence.\\n- ExxonMobil also shows sustained demand at current or slightly higher levels to 2050, requiring continued investment due to natural decline rates (~15% annual decline in fields).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Key Drivers Affecting Demand\\n\\n- **EV adoption** is a critical factor in demand reduction, but penetration rates differ widely by country; affordability and infrastructure challenges constrain growth in developing nations.\\n- **Petrochemical sector** demands increasing volumes of oil and natural gas liquids as feedstocks; expected to grow faster than transport sector demand in some projections.\\n- **Aviation and heavy-duty transport** remain challenging sectors for replacement; demand in these sectors expected to increase or remain robust, offsetting some declines in passenger transport fuels.\\n- **Economic growth and population growth** in emerging and developing economies, particularly India, Africa, and Asia, drive sustained demand growth despite efficiency gains and energy transitions in developed world.\\n- **Energy Transition and Climate Policies** shape demand trajectories, affecting projections in mid to long-term scenarios.\\n- **Upstream investments** are increasing (IEA forecasts $528 billion in 2023, highest since 2015), to maintain supply amid natural field decline and production plateaus.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Images\\n\\n![Projected Oil Demand Trajectory (IEA, OPEC, Others)](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4IHKIN3KARMJBPACDSANSNKTKA.png)\\n\\n![OPEC Long-Term Global Oil Demand Forecast to 2045](https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/D4WWCXPOSVJADAYA55FYPPK27E.png)\\n\\n![Country-Level Capacity Growth and Demand Forecast (2022-2028)](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-19-at-4.49.39-PM.png)\\n\\n![Oil Demand Scenarios from Multiple Agencies (1990-2050)](https://www.crystolenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Peak-oil-demand-2-1024x598.png)\\n\\n![Global Oil Demand Growth 2009-2019](http://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/30609.jpeg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nGlobal oil demand is currently near historic highs (~100 mb/d) and is expected to grow moderately through the late 2020s. Leading agencies like the IEA project a peak or plateau of global demand around 2028-2030 at approximately 105-106 mb/d, largely due to efficiency improvements, EV adoption, and the energy transition. However, OPEC and some industry forecasts suggest a longer growth trajectory with demand reaching approximately 116 mb/d by 2045 driven predominantly by rising demand in emerging and developing economies such as India, Africa, and the Middle East, where energy transition adoption is slower.\\n\\nCountry-level demand trends show strong growth in non-OECD Asia, India overtaking China in demand growth, and OECD countries generally exhibiting declining or flat demand. Key sectors that are growth drivers include petrochemicals and aviation, which offset some expected decline in passenger transport fuels.\\n\\nMultiple scenarios vary significantly, from baseline and stated policy scenarios predicting near-term demand peaking, to high-growth scenarios projecting sustained increases in demand beyond 2040, and climate-driven scenarios expecting faster declines.\\n\\nGiven the diversity of credible forecasts and uncertainties around technology adoption rates, policy implementation, and economic growth, it is prudent for policymakers and businesses to prepare for a range of outcomes, including continued demand growth in emerging markets for decades alongside structural declines in advanced economies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# References\\n\\n- [Crude Prices Could Quadruple If Suppliers Underestimate Future Demand - ExxonMobil](https://www.chemanalyst.com/NewsAndDeals/NewsDetails/crude-prices-could-quadruple-if-suppliers-underestimate-future-demand-exxonmobil-29943)\\n\\n- [OPEC Forecasts 23% Rise in Global Oil Demand Through 2045 - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/opec-forecasts-23-rise-in-global-oil-demand-through-2045-7553163)\\n\\n- [OPEC Forecasts Global Oil Demand to Reach 116 Million b/d in 2045 - Oil & Gas Journal](https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/economics-markets/article/14300012/opec-forecasts-global-oil-demand-to-reach-116-million-b-d-in-2045)\\n\\n- [IEA Oil 2024 Executive Summary](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024/executive-summary)\\n\\n- [Fast-growing developing countries will spur demand for oil for decades - Fraser Institute](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/commentary/fast-growing-developing-countries-will-spur-demand-oil-decades)\\n\\n- [Energy Delusions: Peak Oil Forecasts - National Center for Energy Analytics](https://energyanalytics.org/energy-delusions-peak-oil-forecasts/)\\n\\n- [Global Energy Perspective 2023: Oil outlook - McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/global-energy-perspective-2023-oil-outlook)\\n\\n- [Growth in global oil demand is set to slow significantly by 2028 - IEA News](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-oil-demand-is-set-to-slow-significantly-by-2028)\\n\\n- [Short-Term Energy Outlook - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.php)\\n\\n- [IEA Forecasts Global Oil Demand Peaking by 2028 - Institute for Energy Research](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/iea-forecasts-global-oil-demand-peaking-by-2028/)\\n\\n- [OPEC boosts long-term oil demand outlook, driven by developing world growth - Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-rolls-out-global-oil-outlook-2050-sees-no-peak-demand-2024-09-24/)\\n\\n- [OPEC Digital Publications - World Oil Outlook](https://publications.opec.org/woo/archive/chapter/112/1784)\\n\\n- [OPEC sees oil demand growing to 2050 - Argus Media](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2611481-opec-sees-oil-demand-growing-to-2050)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you require more granular data or specific country-level quantitative metrics beyond what was summarized here, I can assist with targeted follow-up searches or deep dives into official datasets or primary reports.\\n</finding>\\n\\n## Existing Finding 2: Investigate Key Trends and Drivers Affecting Oil Consumption by Country and Industry\\n\\n<finding>\\n# Investigate Key Trends and Drivers Affecting Oil Consumption by Country and Industry\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\n\\nResearch and synthesize qualitative and quantitative data on global oil demand trends influenced by country-specific and industry-specific factors. Explore technological advancements, policy/regulatory shifts, economic growth, behavioral changes, and sector-specific dynamics impacting oil consumption. Include alternative perspectives, risks, and uncertainties affecting outlooks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Research Findings\\n\\n### 1. Global Oil Demand Growth and Regional Dynamics\\n\\n- Global oil demand is projected to rise moderately through the late 2020s until around 2030 before plateauing due to accelerating clean energy transitions. Demand growth is estimated to reach roughly 106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2030 with subsequent stabilization.\\n- Asia, especially emerging economies China and India, dominates demand growth. India is experiencing sharp transport fuel demand increases driven by rising vehicle fleets and economic growth, defying the global downward trend in transport fuel consumption.\\n- China’s growth is more petrochemical-sector-driven as infrastructure investments and EV adoption blunt transport fuel demand growth.\\n- In advanced economies (OECD), oil demand declines consistently due to efficiency gains, EV uptake, and structural changes in transport behavior.\\n- Africa and other developing regions show sustained demand increases as population growth and prosperity rise.\\n- Non-OECD Asia continues leading gains in both 2024-2025 and beyond, though China’s rapid demand growth has slowed notably.\\n- The growth is mainly in petrochemical feedstocks, jet fuel, and natural gas liquids (NGLs); meanwhile, demand for conventional transport fuels is constrained by technology and behavioral changes.\\n\\n### 2. Technological Advances Impacting Oil Demand\\n\\n- Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption is a key disrupter to traditional oil-based transport fuels. EV market share growth is rapid especially in OECD countries but slower in emerging markets due to infrastructure and affordability barriers.\\n- Improved fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines reduces gasoline and diesel demand per vehicle.\\n- Expansion of high-speed rail and other public transport infrastructure, particularly in China and some developed nations, reduces oil demand for passenger vehicles.\\n- Growth in petrochemical feedstock demand maintains overall oil demand despite transport fuel declines, supported by rising consumption of naphtha, LPG, and ethane.\\n\\n### 3. Policy and Regulatory Influences\\n\\n- Climate policies including carbon pricing, emissions reduction targets, and mandates for clean energy uptake are shaping oil demand trajectories especially in advanced economies.\\n- Regulatory measures to promote EV adoption, fuel efficiency standards, and biofuel blending targets accelerate displacement of oil in transportation.\\n- Energy transition policies also influence refinery operations by altering the mix of fuels refined and favoring biofuels or NGLs over traditional gasoline and diesel.\\n- Government strategic reserves replenishments and policies on inventory management add variability to short-term demand.\\n\\n### 4. Sector-Specific Demand Drivers\\n\\n- Transportation remains the largest oil demand sector, but the pattern is shifting:\\n  - Road transport fuel demand is declining or plateauing in most advanced economies.\\n  - Aviation fuel demand is growing steadily, considered harder to replace with alternatives, sustaining oil demand.\\n  - Petrochemical sector demand rises significantly, often offsetting declines in transport fuel consumption.\\n  - Heavy-duty transport and shipping remain challenging sectors for decarbonization, continuing to consume oil products robustly.\\n- Industrial and buildings sectors are seeing some reductions through efficiency improvements and fuel switching but still contribute significantly to oil demand in developing economies.\\n\\n### 5. Economic Growth and Behavioral Changes\\n\\n- Economic growth and rising middle classes in Asia, Africa, and Latin America underpin sustained increases in oil demand.\\n- Urbanization and vehicle fleet expansions, especially in populous developing countries, drive oil consumption upward.\\n- Behavioral shifts including telecommuting, modal shifts to greener transport, and greater energy consciousness contribute to demand moderation in some markets.\\n\\n### 6. Energy Transition and Supply-Side Developments\\n\\n- Production capacity is expanding globally, particularly outside OPEC+, with the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Guyana, and Argentina leading supply growth.\\n- Saudi Arabia and the UAE focus increasing capacity on NGLs and condensates aligned with gas projects, reflecting downstream changes.\\n- Refiners face challenges adapting to declining gasoline demand and growing non-refined fuel products.\\n- Non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels capture the majority of projected demand growth through 2030.\\n- Market uncertainties include potential impacts of geopolitical tensions, compliance with production targets, and changing macroeconomic conditions.\\n\\n### 7. Alternative Views and Risks\\n\\n- Some experts critique mainstream projections, suggesting that rapid EV adoption may be hampered by affordability and infrastructure availability in emerging markets, leading to prolonged demand growth.\\n- Risks include policy disruptions, economic slowdowns or accelerations, technological breakthroughs, and geopolitical shocks influencing both demand and supply.\\n- The disparity between official forecasts (e.g., IEA, OPEC) reflects uncertainties around adoption rates of clean technologies and persistency of combustion-engine vehicles in developing countries.\\n- Investment in upstream oil remains robust due to field decline rates and to meet enduring global demand, despite climate policy pressures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Images\\n\\n![Global Oil Demand by Sector (2012)](https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/common_images/articles/39/World+oil+demand+by+sector+2012.png)\\n\\n![World Oil Consumption Per Capita](https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/Oil-Consumption-Per-Capita-ENERGYminute.png)\\n\\n![Top Ten Oil Consuming Countries](https://www.fxexplained.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/World-Oil-Consumption-30-06-21-scaled.jpg)\\n\\n![US Oil Supply Trends (2013-2023)](https://dieselnet.com/images/n/2019/03iea.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe global oil consumption landscape is being reshaped by a complex interplay of technological, economic, regulatory, and behavioral factors. Emerging economies, particularly in Asia and Africa, are driving the growth in oil demand, while advanced economies show declining or stable consumption due to efficiency gains and greater EV adoption.\\n\\nTechnological progress in EVs and fuel efficiency, alongside clean energy policies, are displacing oil demand mainly in road transport. Nonetheless, sectors such as petrochemicals, aviation, and heavy-duty transport continue to sustain oil consumption. The rise of non-refined liquids and petrochemical feedstock demand, alongside expanding upstream production capacity outside OPEC+, is reshaping supply dynamics.\\n\\nPolicy frameworks, economic growth patterns, and technology adoption rates remain critical uncertainties with risks that could accelerate or delay peak oil demand. Future outlooks must consider diverse regional realities and sectoral developments, preparing for a range of scenarios from moderate plateauing to sustained growth in emerging markets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Oil & Gas Q1 2024 Insights - Sia Partners](https://www.sia-partners.com/en/insights/publications/oil-gas-q1-2024-insights)\\n\\n- [Executive summary - Oil 2024 - Analysis - IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2024/executive-summary)\\n\\n- [Oil Market Report - December 2024 – Analysis - IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-december-2024)\\n\\n- [IEA Energy System Overview](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\n\\n- [IEA Topics: Transport](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport)\\n\\n- [IEA Topics: Industry](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/industry)\\n</finding>\\n\\n# Current Task\\n\\n## Title\\n\\nCollect Comparative Analyses and Future Scenarios for Oil Demand Across Regions and Forecast Models\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nAcquire comparative studies and scenario analyses from multiple sources contrasting oil consumption trajectories by region (e.g., OECD vs non-OECD, Asia, Americas, Europe).

Introduction\\n---------------\\n\\nAs 2025 unfolds, the global economy, international alliances, and the rules-based international order face new questions and challenges. Energy markets and international climate negotiations are not immune to this turmoil and may undergo profound change as global markets and geopolitical dynamics adapt to new realities. Amid deep uncertainty on these and many other fronts, the world continues to face the enormous and pressing challenge of transforming its energy system to address global climate change.\\n\\nTo understand how our energy system is evolving and how it needs to change to reach net-zero emissions, each year, a variety of organizations produce projections that imagine a wide range of futures based on divergent visions about policies, technologies, prices, and geopolitics. Because these vary widely and depend heavily on varied assumptions and methodologies, they are difficult to compare on an apples-to-apples basis. In this report, we apply a detailed harmonization process to compare 13 scenarios across seven energy outlooks published in 2024 (and two historical data sources). Taken together, these scenarios offer a broad scope of potential changes to the energy system as envisioned by some of its most knowledgeable organizations. Table 1 shows the historical datasets, outlooks, and scenarios, with additional detail provided in Section 4.\\n\\n### Table 1. Outlooks and Scenarios Examined in This Report\\n\\n![Image 3: Table 1](https://media.rff.org/images/Table_1_HDth6cB.width-1480.png)\\n\\nA brief description of our methodology is provided in _Data and Methods_ (Section 5), with select indicators in _Statistics_ (Section 6). For the full methodology and interactive graphing tools, visit [www.rff.org/geo](https://www.rff.org/publications/data-tools/global-energy-outlook/).\\n\\nThroughout the figures included in this report, we use a consistent labeling system that distinguishes among the different types of scenarios (see Table 2):\\n\\n*   For “Reference” scenarios, which assume limited or no new policies, we use a long-dashed line: this set comprises scenarios from ExxonMobil, IEEJ, and OPEC.\\n*   For “Evolving Policies” scenarios, which assume that policies and technologies develop according to recent trends and/or the expert views of the team producing the outlook, we use solid lines: this set comprises BNEF ETS, bp Current Trajectory, and IEA STEPS. Although they do not follow the same sets of assumptions, we also include Equinor Walls and IEEJ Advanced Technologies scenarios because their CO₂ emissions trajectories are similar to other “Evolving Policies” scenarios. For IEA APS, which assumes governments implement all announced energy and climate policies, we use a dot-dash format.\\n*   “Ambitious Climate” scenarios are not designed around policies but instead structured to achieve specific climate targets. Some limit global mean temperature rise to below 2°C by 2100 (bp Net Zero), and others limit it to 1.5°C by 2100 or aim for net-zero emissions by 2050 (BNEF NZS, Equinor Bridges, IEA NZE). For these scenarios, we use a dotted line.\\n\\n### Table 2. Legend for Different Scenario Types\\n\\n![Image 4: Table 2](https://media.rff.org/images/Table_2_Cf4SrUf.width-1480.png)\\n\\nFigures and tables in this report sometimes refer to regional groupings of “East” (Africa, Asia Pacific, Middle East) and “West” (Americas, Europe, Eurasia).\\n\\n2. Key Findings\\n---------------\\n\\nIn 2024, low-emissions technologies have benefited from substantial tailwinds, with a record $2 trillion investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure in 2024, accelerating **renewable power** deployment and **energy efficiency** improvements. However, significant headwinds to the energy transition remain as **global CO₂ emissions** reach record highs, and the benefits of energy investments are distributed unevenly. Growing challenges also come from the prioritization of energy security, a new direction in energy and climate policy from the United States, and surging electricity demand from emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) (this report examines scenarios prepared before the US 2024 election).\\n\\nThe record investment in clean energy deployment is largely driven by accelerated electrification and global **electricity demand**, which is projected to grow substantially across scenarios. Under all scenarios, renewable energy sources, led by wind and solar, are more than 50 percent of electricity generated in 2050. **Fossil fuel generation** remains roughly flat or declines across scenarios, but the degree of decline and share of generation in 2050 depends on the scale of climate ambition.\\n\\n### Figure 1. World Electricity Generation Grows Rapidly, Led by Wind and Solar\\n\\n![Image 5: Figure 1](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_1_TGimsXB.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: 2050 scenarios ordered from highest to lowest total levels of fossil fuel generation.\\n\\nElectricity demand will continue to grow across the economy, particularly in the buildings and transportation sectors, with the speed of their electrification depending in large part on policy decisions. At the same time, wind and solar are now the cheapest sources of electricity in many markets. Although both have grown rapidly in recent years, renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass, and hydro) supplied less than half of the more than 14,000 TWh of increased electricity generation from 2000 to 2023, with most of the remainder met by coal and natural gas.\\n\\nElectricity generated from coal declines under all scenarios by 2050, ranging from a decrease of 35 percent (IEEJ Reference) to 94 percent (bp NZE and IEA NZE) relative to 2023. For electricity from natural gas, projections vary much more widely. Under Reference and Evolving Policy scenarios, it remains flat or grows substantially, from a 7 percent decline (BNEF ETS) to an 83 percent increase (IEEJ Reference) between 2023 and 2050. Under Ambitious Climate scenarios, it falls but is not fully eliminated, often pairing with carbon capture or negative emissions technologies.\\n\\nUnder all scenarios, electricity from **solar** and **wind** grow substantially, accounting for 37–74 percent of world generation by 2050. Their distribution has not been evenly spread across regions. Three regions (United States, Europe, and China) have accounted for around 75 percent of total **solar capacity**—with China alone accounting for more than 60 percent of capacity growth in 2023.\\n\\n### Figure 2. Percentage of Total Solar Capacity by Region (US, Europe, China, ROW)\\n\\n![Image 6: Figure 2](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_2_PFLVqMx.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA. Projections are taken directly for IEA. Projections for other organizations are estimated based on an organization’s generation projections, converted to capacity assuming capacity factors imputed from the IEA APS.\\n\\nUnder Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios that provide regional solar data (bp, IEA, and IEEJ), other regions make up a larger share of total deployment by 2050. From 2023 to 2050, the compound average annual growth rate (CAAGR) for the rest of the world ranges from 6.7 percent (IEEJ Reference) to 12 percent (IEA APS and bp NZE) and outpaces that in the United States, Europe, and China in all scenarios. However, high cost of capital and project risk in developing countries, coupled with the relatively low cost of fossil fuels, may slow renewable energy growth.\\n\\nMuch analysis over the last year has focused on the role of **AI** and associated **electricity demand** from data centers. Although data centers have been a source of electricity demand for years, the rapid growth and prevalence of AI tools has generated headlines and the potential headwinds of massive load growth, especially in the United States, Europe, and China. Figure 3 compares electricity generation in projections from the last two years against the most recent outlooks from IEA and IEEJ.\\n\\n### FIgure 3. Previous and Current Projected Electricity Generation from IEA and IEEJ\\n\\n![Image 7: Figure 3](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_3_85mCfMM.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA.\\n\\nUS electricity supply in 2035 is projected to be 3 percent higher in the 2024 STEPS scenario compared with 2023. By 2050, IEA projects generation to be 7 percent higher than the prior year’s scenario while IEEJ projects generation to be 9 percent higher than the 2023 Advanced Technology. Although this is a significant upward revision, data center growth is only a small part of total growth in US electricity needs. In IEA’s STEPS scenario, the buildings sector (which includes data centers) accounts for only 11 percent of the increase in generation to 2035, and the impact of data centers is assumed to be “modest relative to other sectors.” The transportation and industrial sectors contribute much more significantly to overall demand growth.\\n\\nIn the EU and China, electricity generation in IEA STEPS was also revised upward compared to previous years. However, IEEJ revised its outlook downward for these regions in 2024 after a significant upward revision in 2023.\\n\\nOf course, these projections contain a high degree of uncertainty and, in general, do not match recent analysis from more bullish industry experts. For instance, Wood Mackenzie’s base case modeling suggests that data center expansions could increase the sector’s global electricity consumption from 500 TWh in 2023 to 4,500 TWh in 2050. That would represent 28 percent of the total growth in generation in the United States, EU, and China by 2050 in IEA STEPS and 49 percent of the growth in IEEJ Advanced Technology. A recent Bipartisan Policy Center study suggests that demand from data centers could account for at most 25 percent of US new electricity generation by 2030. As innovation continues, rapid improvements in hardware and energy efficiency of AI models (as seen with DeepSeek) may occur. Additional factors, such as manufacturing bottlenecks and limitations on AI chips or infrastructure, may also dampen some of the exuberance around generation growth.\\n\\n**Global energy demand** grows slowly or declines under all scenarios, as energy efficiency improves and combusted energy sources make up a smaller share of the primary energy mix, which reduces energy conversion losses. In most Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, global demand rises slowly, plateauing around 600–750 Quadrillion British Thermal Units (QBtu) by 2050. In Ambitious Climate scenarios, primary energy demand declines between 10 percent (IEA NZE) and 33 percent (Equinor Bridges) relative to 2023. As with other trends in this report, energy demand growth differs between high-income nations, where demand typically falls, and low-income nations, where consumption continues to grow.\\n\\n### Figure 4. World Primary Energy Demand and Carbon Intensity (net CO₂ per QBtu)\\n\\n![Image 8: Figure 4](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_4_Cgxf4kr.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Projections ordered from highest to lowest demand for fossil fuels. Historical data from IEA. “Biomass” excludes biofuels, which are included in “Liquids.” “Other” includes wind and solar for IEEJ, Equinor, and OPEC and hydro for BNEF. Carbon intensity is net CO₂ emissions per unit of primary energy demand. CO₂ data are not available for OPEC.\\n\\nAll scenarios project lower coal demand in 2050 compared to 2023, ranging from a decline of 28 percent (IEEJ Reference) to 93 percent (Equinor Bridges), but other fossil fuels offer a more mixed picture. Liquids demand is higher in 2050 under three scenarios, and natural gas demand is higher under five scenarios. As with previous years, wind and solar grow dramatically under all scenarios where data are available. The share of wind and solar in primary energy demand ranges from 12 percent (ExxonMobil) to 41 percent (IEA NZE) in 2050.\\n\\nIn a change from the last several decades, the carbon intensity of energy falls under all scenarios. For Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, this ranges from 16 percent (IEEJ Reference) to 59 percent (IEEJ Advanced Technologies). Ambitious Climate scenarios project a much more dramatic decline, even reaching negative territory under one scenario (Equinor Bridges).\\n\\nGlobal **CO₂ emissions** have risen by almost 50 percent since 2000, reaching roughly 35 gigatonnes in 2023. However, achieving net-zero emissions targets will require CO₂ emissions to decline dramatically. This year’s scenarios show a wide range of possible outcomes, but Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios indicate that current efforts fall far short of the global goal of limiting temperature rise to “well below 2°C by 2100” as articulated in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.\\n\\n### Figure 5. Net CO₂ Emissions\\n\\n![Image 9: Figure 5](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_5_Ipzsjab.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from bp.\\n\\nGlobal CO₂ emissions are projected to decline under all scenarios except IEEJ Reference, where they remain relatively flat (CO₂ projections are not available from OPEC, but emissions likely grow under its Reference case). Under other Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, emissions decline from 2023 to 2050, ranging from -24 percent (bp Current Trajectory) to -70 percent (IEA APS). This breadth highlights the gap between existing efforts and the goals articulated by countries in their Nationally Determined Contributions, which are reflected in the IEA APS.\\n\\nAmbitious Climate scenarios project a much faster rate of decline in emissions, falling by more than 90 percent by 2050. These scenarios accelerate energy efficiency gains, grow renewable technologies, reduce fossil fuel demand, and deploy CCS at scale by 2050. In some of these scenarios, net CO₂ emissions remain slightly above zero by 2050. These pathways reflect an “overshoot” scenario, where some portion of historical emissions are negated by future CO₂ removals using direct air capture, nature-based solutions, or other strategies.\\n\\nIn 2023, a record-breaking 562 gigawatts (GW) of **renewable capacity** was added worldwide, more than 60 percent higher than in 2022. However, achieving the goal set at COP28 of “tripling renewable energy capacity globally” to 11,000 GW by 2030 will require more than 6,700 GW of additional capacity, or an average of more than 950 GW per year. This raises the question of whether tailwinds from the growth seen in 2023 can be expanded and sustained in the years ahead. In particular, challenges with integrating new capacity in regional grids and with supply chains for some technologies (such as manufacturing bottlenecks in the onshore wind market and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials) could be a barrier to rapid growth. The prospects of a global trade war and reduced policy support for renewables in the United States pose additional headwinds to achieving a tripling of renewables by 2030.\\n\\n### Figure 6. Renewable Electricity Capacity Versus 2030 Target\\n\\n![Image 10: Figure 6](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_6_5BKkdk3.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA. “Renewables” includes hydro, biomass, wind, solar, geothermal, and tidal energy. Projections are taken directly for IEA. Projections for other organizations are estimated based on an organization’s renewable electricity generation projections, converted to capacity assuming capacity factors imputed from the IEA APS.\\n\\nTwo Ambitious Climate scenarios (IEA NZE and BNEF NZS) and one Evolving Policies scenario (IEA APS) achieve the 2030 target, and Equinor Bridges falls just below it. Except for APS, these scenarios are not based on existing or announced policies. Nonetheless, most scenarios expect renewable capacity additions to accelerate, with IEA STEPS showing average annual growth of 789 GW. Three Reference scenarios are more bearish, with average annual growth falling below 2023’s level through 2030.\\n\\nIn all scenarios, renewables growth is led by wind and solar, and in all IEA scenarios, solar PV more than triples from 2023 to 2030, accounting for more than 70 percent of renewable capacity growth. In 2023, solar module prices fell and are expected to remain low, thanks to investments in manufacturing capacity in many countries, including China.\\n\\nEnergy security and resilience continue to be key concerns for policymakers, reinforced by geopolitical events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and an uncertain US security posture. At the same time, there is a surge of new **liquified natural gas (LNG)** export capacity, driven by new projects in the United States and Qatar that are set to increase export capacity from 578 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023 to 850 bcm by 2030. Although this capacity boosts global energy security and the diversity of supply on global energy markets, world demand for LNG declines well below export capacity under Ambitious Climate scenarios. This raises the possibility that either (a) LNG exports may be a headwind undermining global climate goals or (b) these facilities will become “stranded assets” in a net-zero future.\\n\\n### Figure 7. Projected LNG Demand and Export Capacity\\n\\n![Image 11: Figure 7](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_7_3RrxdAF.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA. Export capacity based on IEA estimates. Future export capacity includes only existing and under construction projects. New LNG export capacity primarily comes from the United States and Qatar.\\n\\nIn 2040 and 2050, LNG demand meets or exceeds existing capacity in Evolving Policy and Reference scenarios but falls well short in Ambitious Climate scenarios. Additional LNG facilities are likely to begin construction in the years ahead in the United States, Qatar, and elsewhere, meaning that market oversupply could be even greater by midcentury under Ambitious Climate scenarios. However, some recent projections, such as Shell’s 2025 LNG Outlook (not included in this analysis), are more bullish on future demand.\\n\\nKey markets, particularly Europe, are already making significant progress in energy transition efforts, reflected by declining LNG demand by 2050 under all scenarios. In China, LNG growth is modest under the most bullish scenarios, suggestion that renewables, rather than natural gas, are likely to lead in displacing domestic coal. Trade disputes sparked by US tariffs include major importers, such as China, which may further raise the costs of trade, diminishing the outlook for US LNG.\\n\\nSince 2010, **natural gas** demand has grown almost 30 percent globally, driven primarily by North America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. The future of global natural gas varies widely by scenario but has two broad and opposing regional trends. In developing countries, demand rises, driven by industrialization and economic growth. In developed ones, demand is flat or declining due to electrification of end uses, other investments in the energy transition, and—in Europe—a potentially declining industrial base.\\n\\n### Figure 8. Change in Natural Gas Demand\\n\\n![Image 12: Figure 8](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_8_9AbzI2r.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA.\\n\\nFrom 2010 to 2023, natural gas demand in Europe and Eurasia fell by 8 percent. In most scenarios, this trend continues through 2035, and it is consistent across every scenario by 2050, ranging from -3 percent (bp Current Trajectory) to -74 percent (bp NZE) relative to 2023. In North America, demand grows or declines moderately through 2035 in Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, and Ambitious Climate scenarios project a substantial decline. All scenarios but one (IEEJ Reference) project demand to fall by 2050, ranging -7 percent (ExxonMobil) to -49 percent (IEA APS) relative to 2023 levels.\\n\\nIn Asia Pacific, all scenarios except IEA APS project increased demand through 2035. Although this growth continues through 2050 for most Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, IEA APS and bp NZE project a sharp decline, reflecting higher levels of climate ambition. Africa and the Middle East both see growth in demand through 2035 and 2050 in Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, and Ambitious Climate scenarios again project a slowdown or decline by 2050.\\n\\nUnder most scenarios, global **oil demand** is lower by 2050 than it is today. Three Reference scenarios (ExxonMobil, IEEJ, and OPEC) show oil consumption growing slowly or plateauing by 2025, but all other scenarios project a peak and decline of oil consumption by 2030. However, 2050 has a wide range of projected demand, spanning 98 mb/d. Under Ambitious Climate scenarios, oil demand falls to roughly 25 mb/d by 2050.\\n\\n### Figure 9. World Oil Demand\\n\\n![Image 13: Figure 9](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_9_11xUlYt.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA. Where outlooks do not provide projections in physical units (mb/d), we convert to mb/d using a factor of 1.832 QBtu per mb/d.\\n\\nToday and in all projections, oil consumption is concentrated in the industrial and transportation sectors. Across most Reference and Evolving Policy scenarios, oil consumption in transportation peaks by 2030, primarily due to vehicle efficiency improvements and continued electrification in the light duty fleet. In the industrial sector, oil demand grows or remains flat in Reference and Evolving Policy scenarios, with growth concentrated in emerging economies.\\n\\nIn North America, oil demand has remained relatively flat and declines across scenarios by 2030. Similarly, demand peaks before 2030 under all scenarios in Europe and Eurasia. In China, demand peaks by 2030 under all scenarios other than OPEC Reference. In India and Africa, however, oil demand grows under all Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios but declines in Ambitious Climate scenarios for both regions.\\n\\nHydrogen is poised to play a larger role in the energy system and may be particularly valuable in “hard-to-abate” sectors, such as industry and heavy-duty transportation. Hydrogen is used today in oil refining and chemicals production, primarily sourced from natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR). In Ambitious Climate scenarios, hydrogen plays a substantial role in the energy sector, sourced largely from electrolysis powered by renewables (“green hydrogen”) and SMR with CCS (“blue hydrogen”).\\n\\n### Figure 10. Global Share of Hydrogen in Final Energy Consumption\\n\\n![Image 14: Figure 10](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_10_tqlQJ9L.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Calculated as final energy consumption from hydrogen divided by total final energy consumption.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, hydrogen grows fastest under Ambitious Climate scenarios, rising to account for 4–7 percent of global final energy consumption by 2050. In Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios, hydrogen plays a larger role than in today’s energy system but remains below 1 percent of final energy consumption under most scenarios. A key headwind to the future of low-emissions hydrogen is the uncertainty around policy support. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act included a tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram of clean hydrogen and funding to develop hydrogen “hubs.” However, the outcome of the 2024 federal election has created deep uncertainty over the durability of these policies.\\n\\nOnly the IEA provides public data on the contribution of different technologies to the hydrogen mix. In STEPS, green hydrogen comprises roughly a quarter of global production in 2050 and blue hydrogen comprises 16 percent, meaning that low-emissions hydrogen comprises less than half of the global total. Low-emissions production grows much more rapidly in APS, with green and blue hydrogen comprising 64 and 23 percent of the mix, respectively. In NZE, almost 80 percent of hydrogen produced in 2050 is green while almost all of the remainder is blue.\\n\\n3. In Focus\\n-----------\\n\\n### 3.1. Different Regions, Different Renewables Shares\\n\\nRenewables, led by solar and wind, have come to play a significant role in the global energy mix, and this growth continues under all scenarios through 2050. Breaking down that growth by region reveals different distributions by resource type. Regions have different climates, natural resource endowments, and policies that shape their historical and projected shares of renewable demand. We compare the distribution of solar, wind, and geothermal energy demand from 2010 to 2050 between IEA, bp, and IEEJ, the three projections that provide sufficient data for such analysis.\\n\\n#### 3.1.1. Solar\\n\\nIn China, solar’s growth has been rapid in recent years, with capacity increasing by 45 percent in 2024 alone. China’s solar consumption leads the world, more than twice that of the US level in 2023. China continues to lead in 2050, accounting for 16 percent of global solar energy demand in the most cautious scenario (bp Current Trajectory) and 45 percent in the most confident (IEA APS). China is also a leading exporter of solar technology, particularly to Europe and other Asian nations, a trend that is likely to continue if China continues to be the world’s lowest-cost supplier.\\n\\nIn India, solar demand also grows strongly, rising from roughly 0.4 QBtu in 2023 to 1.1–1.9 QBtu by 2030, then accelerating strongly to 2050, with 6–8 QBtu under Evolving Policies scenarios and 12–14 QBtu under Ambitious Climate scenarios. However, India continues to lag China and the United States in total solar demand across all scenarios. Taken together, the global “East” commands solar energy demand across all scenarios by 2050. However, its share declines from 70 percent in 2023 to 58–69 percent by 2050 across scenarios from bp (Net Zero) and IEA (STEPS).\\n\\nThe expected growth in solar from now until 2030 is marked across multiple geographies. In the IEA scenarios, US solar demand 2023–2030 is expected to quadruple under STEPS and quintuple under APS. In China, solar demand quintuples under both IEA scenarios. These ambitious growth projections are contextualized by the suddenly contrasting policy outlooks for the energy transition in both countries. Although China continues a booming solar build-out, the United States has recently taken steps to off-ramp federal support of renewables deployment.\\n\\n### Figure 11. Solar Primary Energy Demand by Region\\n\\n![Image 15: Figure 11](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_11_h0R5sOz.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA.\\n\\n#### 3.1.2. Wind\\n\\nUnlike solar, wind energy demand has historically been led by the global “West,” which accounted for more than 75 percent of global wind demand in 2010. However, other nations in the East, and China in particular, have increasingly deployed wind energy. By 2023, the global East had grown to account for 47 percent of the world’s wind energy consumption, and China was the world leader at the country-level. This trend is posed to continue, as China increased its wind capacity by 18 percent in 2024.\\n\\nLooking forward, China’s wind sector continues to grow strongly, although its share of global demand falls as other nations grow even faster. Under the scenarios that provide sufficient data, by 2050, China’s wind demand grows from 3 QBtu in 2023 to 12–19 QBtu, with its share of global demand falling from 38 percent to 9–23 percent. India’s wind sector also grows strongly over the projection period, rising from 0.3 QBtu in 2023 to 3–9 QBtu by 2050. India’s share of global wind demand rises from 4 percent in 2023 to 5–10 percent by 2050 across the scenarios.\\n\\nIn the West, Europe has driven the growth of wind energy, with 20 percent of its electricity generated by wind in 2024. Under the scenarios examined, Europe continues to lead the West in wind; by 2050, it accounts for 47–71 percent of demand and consumes similar levels as China, the world leader. However, several factors are generating headwinds to growth in the West, including high capital costs, difficulty in siting and permitting, and reductions in policy support. Reflecting these challenges, some major wind firms have announced investment cuts in recent months.\\n\\n### Figure 12. Wind Primary Energy Demand by Region\\n\\n![Image 16: Figure 12](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_12_IW6Lq2g.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA.\\n\\n#### 3.1.3. Geothermal\\n\\nAs electricity demand rises rapidly, new innovations are enabling energy sources with previously limited applications. For instance, conventional geothermal power has existed for decades but was limited to a handful of regions with high levels of heat at relatively shallow depths and permeable rock. However, new technologies adapted from the oil and gas industry, including horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing, have greatly expanded opportunities. Most outlooks that provide geothermal-specific data project strong growth to 2050.\\n\\n### Figure 13. World Geothermal Demand\\n\\n![Image 17: Figure 13](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_13_mXqzcgC.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from IEA.\\n\\nIn recent decades, geothermal has grown slowly, rising at 2.4 percent CAAGR from 2010 to 2023, reaching 3.3 QBtu. However, most outlooks project significantly higher growth to 2050, with the more bullish scenarios ranging from 4.6 percent (IEEJ Reference) to 7.7 percent (IEA NZE) CAAGR. This reflects significant cost declines that are projected to continue, making projects competitive with other dispatchable or “baseload” power sources. Although geothermal grows strongly across most scenarios, it remains a relatively small portion of overall primary energy demand, rising to 5 percent of global primary energy demand by 2050 under the most bullish scenario (IEA NZE).\\n\\nUnlike wind and solar, China, Europe, and India have made small contributions to geothermal production historically. Instead, the world’s leading geothermal producers are Indonesia, the United States, and the Philippines, which benefit from suitable geologies that have enabled the deployment of conventional systems. IEEJ, the only outlook that publishes country-level data on geothermal, projects that Indonesia’s demand will shoot up with a CAAGR of more than 5 percent through 2050, ultimately reaching 5–7 QBtu by 2050. IEEJ projects relatively slow growth in other regions, including the United States, which suggests that it is not accounting for recent innovations in advanced geothermal development.\\n\\nIn a 2024 report focused specifically on geothermal, IEA describes the vast potential for advanced technologies to be deployed globally. Because of the technological innovations described earlier in this section, geothermal may now be developed cost-effectively worldwide, rather than focusing on the relatively few regions with exceptionally shallow resources (e.g., Indonesia). As these technologies develop, projections for geothermal’s role may become much more substantial.\\n\\n### 3.2. Evolving Expectations for Africa’s Energy Mix\\n\\nAfrica has seen the fastest population growth of any continent in recent decades, recently growing to more than 1.5 billion people. Projections in this year’s Global Energy Outlook estimate that it will exceed 2 billion people by 2040, far outpacing growth in all other regions. Unsurprisingly, energy demand is projected to increase alongside the continent’s population and economy. However, expectations about the pace of energy demand growth have slowed considerably in recent years. Compared with projections from 2018, future demand for coal, oil, and—for most projections—natural gas, have each declined while renewables have grown.\\n\\n### Figure 14. Projections for Africa Primary Energy Demand from 2018 and 2024\\n\\n![Image 18: Figure 14](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_14_nqRPIYL.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Biomass excluded for bp and EIA. For EIA, “oil” includes nonpetroleum liquids (i.e., biofuels). EIA did not publish an International Energy Outlook in 2018 or 2024, so we use 2019 and 2023 instead. IEA NPS refers to the New Policies Scenario, an Evolving Policies scenario similar in design to 2024’s STEPS scenario. Both IEEJ scenarios refer to the IEEJ Reference scenario.\\n\\nThese lower expectations for energy demand growth reflect reduced expectations for the energy intensity of the continent’s economy. GDP growth is stronger in recent projections relative to those made in 2018, and population growth expectations are broadly similar. As a result, energy use per unit of economic output in 2040 is 25–30 percent lower in 2024’s projections relative to 2018’s, and per capita energy use is roughly 20 percent lower.\\n\\n#### 3.2.1. Energy Poverty\\n\\nDo these lower levels of per capita energy consumption suggest that efforts to alleviate energy poverty in Africa are failing to gain traction? According to recent data from the IEA, more than 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and roughly 1 billion lack clean cooking equipment. Although electricity consumption per capita grew by 18 percent from 2000 to 2022, it remained 82 percent below the global average in that year. On average, Africans consumed just 0.6 MWh per person in 2022, ranging from 0.015 MWh in Chad to 3.5–4 MWh in South Africa and Libya. For reference, a standard refrigerator/freezer combo in the United States uses 0.3–0.8 MWh annually.\\n\\nAfter several years of little improvement after the pandemic and inflation-induced challenges, the IEA STEPS scenario projects that electrification will accelerate to cover 70 percent of the continent’s population by 2030, up from 59 percent today. It also projects that the number of people lacking access to clean cooking technologies will plateau by 2030. These developments, although far from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #7 (universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy), do offer some hope for further progress. However, substantial additional investment from inside and outside of Africa is clearly needed to improve access to modern energy services.\\n\\n#### 3.2.2. Coal and Electricity\\n\\nReflecting global trends, expectations for coal consumption in Africa have declined dramatically over roughly the last 10 years. Reference and Evolving Policies projections from 2015 envisioned rapid coal demand growth through 2040, whereas projections from 2024 show a slow decline, falling by 20–40 percent under scenarios from IEA, bp, and ExxonMobil (Figure 15).\\n\\n### Figure 15. Projections for Africa Coal Demand, 2015 and 2024\\n\\n![Image 19: Figure 15](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_15_yNZ8qm0.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: IEA projections are New Policies (2015) and STEPS (2024) scenarios; bp projections are Reference (2015) and Current Trajectory (2024) scenarios. Both ExxonMobil projections are Reference scenarios.\\n\\nThis decline reflects, in large part, South Africa’s recent efforts to transition away from coal, with the support of international finance through the Just Energy Transition Partnership. From 2000 through 2014, South Africa consumed more than 90 percent of all coal used for power generation on the continent, but this share has fallen to 84 percent as of 2022. Similarly, the share of coal in South Africa’s power mix has declined from more than 90 percent in the early 2010s to 84 percent as of 2022. In its place, wind and solar have grown to account for 7 percent of generation, along with oil, which is used as a “peaking” fuel, providing 2 percent of South Africa’s electricity in 2022.\\n\\nOutside of South Africa, natural gas consumption in the power sector has grown dramatically in recent years, becoming the continent’s largest overall power source in 2012 and, by 2022, accounting for 47 percent of its electricity mix. Looking forward, projections for natural gas demand vary widely. The most bullish projections come from IEEJ, which projects power sector gas demand to more than triple by 2050 under both of its scenarios. More modest growth comes in IEA STEPS (+75 percent) and Equinor Walls (+26 percent); while gas-fired generation declines by 33 under IEA APS and nearly 70 percent under Equinor Bridges.\\n\\nRenewable electricity generation grows rapidly under all scenarios that provide comparable data. Compared to 2023, solar generation across Africa increases roughly 30-fold under Evolving Policies scenarios by 2050 and nearly 100-fold under Ambitious Climate scenarios from Equinor and IEA. Wind also grows impressively, rising 12- to 15-fold under Evolving Policies scenarios and as much as 60-fold under Ambitious Climate scenarios over the same period. Together, solar and wind grow from 5 percent of electricity generation in 2023 to 39 percent by 2050 at the low end (IEA STEPS) and up to 75 percent at the high end (Equinor Bridges). Figure 16 illustrates power sector projections from the IEA and Equinor, the two outlooks that publish sufficient data.\\n\\n### Figure 16. Electricity Generation in Africa\\n\\n![Image 20: Figure 16](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_16_ETkeHRQ.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Energy sources in the “other” category are not specified but likely include large proportions of hydropower and contributions from geothermal and biomass.\\n\\nPer capita electricity consumption in 2050 ranges widely but remains well below global averages across the scenarios that provide sufficient data. Under IEA STEPS, IEEJ Reference, and Equinor Walls, per capita electricity consumption in Africa averages 1.1–1.3 MWh per person, and ranges from 1.7–2.2 MWh per person under IEA APS, IEEJ Advanced Technologies, and Equinor Bridges. Globally, per capita electricity consumption in 2050 ranges from a low of 4.8 MWh (ExxonMobil Reference) to a high of 8.3 MWh per capita (IEA NZE). In 2023, average US per capita consumption was 11.6 MWh.\\n\\n#### 3.2.3. Oil and Natural Gas\\n\\nProjected demand for oil in Africa has also declined substantially relative to outlooks from roughly 10 years ago. As shown in Figure 17, projections in 2024 from bp and ExxonMobil are considerably lower than those made under similar scenarios in 2015. From 2000 to 2015, the CAAGR for oil demand was 3 percent across the continent. Had this growth rate continued, oil demand would have exceeded 15 QBtu by 2040, roughly in line with ExxonMobil’s projection from 2015 (projections from bp and IEA were less bullish). However, oil demand growth stagnated in subsequent years, declining substantially in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but then rebounded, rising by roughly 5 percent annually in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\n\\n### Figure 17. Projections for Africa Oil Demand, 2015 and 2024\\n\\n![Image 21: Figure 17](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_17_y0fobSO.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: IEA projections are New Policies (2015) and STEPS (2024); bp projections are Reference (2015) and Current Trajectory (2024) Both ExxonMobil projections are Reference scenarios. bp’s 2015 projection is “liquids” rather than “oil.” Liquids include non-petroleum liquid fuels (e.g., liquid biofuels), which are a very small portion of Africa’s current or projected demand for liquid fuels under these scenarios.\\n\\nFor natural gas, this year’s projections are mostly barely distinguishable from those made under similar scenarios in 2015. IEA, bp, and ExxonMobil all project roughly a doubling of demand by 2050 (ExxonMobil’s historical data and projections are higher than bp and IEA because it includes flared natural gas with associated oil production, which bp and IEA do not).\\n\\n### Figure 18. Projections for Africa Natural Gas Demand, 2015 and 2024\\n\\n![Image 22: Figure 18](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_18_MR94Gdf.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: IEA projections are New Policies (2015) and STEPS (2024); bp projections are Reference (2015) and Current Trajectory (2024) scenarios. ExxonMobil projections are Reference scenarios. ExxonMobil includes flared natural gas.\\n\\nHowever, this demand growth is not consistent with Ambitious Climate scenarios, under which natural gas consumption declines substantially by 2050 globally and in Africa. For example, bp’s Net-Zero shows African gas demand falling to roughly 2.2 Qbtu by 2050, and Equinor’s Bridges falls to 2.5 Qbtu. This represents a decline of more than half from 2023’s levels (6 QBtu).\\n\\n### 3.3. China’s Decarbonization Outlook\\n\\nSince surpassing the United States in 2006, China has been the largest contributing country to annual CO₂ emissions globally, meaning its emissions trajectory is a key factor in future climate change. In 2020, President Xi Jinping announced China’s dual goals of “aim[ing] to have CO₂ emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060”—sometimes referred to as the “3060” dual carbon goals. In this section, we focus on the projections for China’s CO₂ emissions and energy use by fuel—both for primary energy and in the electricity sector specifically.\\n\\nFigure 19 shows projected CO₂ (or CO₂-equivalent) emissions from China through 2050. Most of the projections anticipate China hitting peak emissions before the 2030 target, with only ExxonMobil projecting a peak in 2030. This suggests some optimism regarding the “30” component of the dual “3060” goals. The projections typically end in 2050, making it somewhat difficult to judge the likelihood of the “2060” component of “3060.” Nonetheless, a simple (albeit potentially naïve) extrapolation of the trends through 2050 suggests that most of the scenarios are not on track for net-zero emissions by 2060. Only the Ambitious Climate scenarios from bp and Equinor effectively reach zero by 2050. Yet all scenarios imply substantial emissions reductions compared to today.\\n\\n### Figure 19. CO₂ Emissions in China\\n\\n![Image 23: Figure 19](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_19_dA7T1Zg.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Emissions metrics differ across sources in gross versus net and CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e) versus CO₂. Equinor values are gross CO₂; ExxonMobil, IEA, and IEEJ values are net CO₂; bp values are net CO₂e.\\n\\nFigure 20 shows the changing primary energy mix underlying these projected reductions in Chinese emissions. Most scenarios show relatively flat or rising total primary energy use, even rising through 2030 despite falling emissions. The deceleration in energy use relative to past trends owes in part to a combination of a shrinking population and slowing GDP growth rates (typically in the 2–4 percent range). Across the board, the diverging trends in emissions (declining) relative to energy use (flat or rising) owe to a rising share of nonhydro renewable energy replacing coal, and the contributions of other fuels vary across scenarios. In Reference and Evolving Policies scenarios (left column of Figure 20), oil and gas consumption remains relatively constant but falls under scenarios with stronger climate action (right column). The most notable example is Equinor, which envisions oil’s contribution to primary energy falling from 20 percent in 2020 to 18 percent in 2050 under Walls but to just 9 percent under Bridges. The nonhydro renewable share, driven by wind and solar, rises from 9 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in Walls but 67 percent in Bridges.\\n\\n### Figure 20. Primary Energy Consumption in China, by Fuel\\n\\n![Image 24: Figure 20](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_20.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: “Other” is the difference between the reported total and all other categories and only relevant for IEA.\\n\\nBecause a major transformation of the energy system in China would likely require a significant electrification of the economy, Figure 21 dives into the projected electricity generation by fuel, including a disaggregation of nonhydro renewables into the three main components: wind, solar, and biomass. Biomass is generally projected to play a minor role. Although IEEJ and Equinor project relatively equal contributions of wind and solar, IEA projects major increases in solar in both STEPS and APS. Despite these increases in renewable generation, coal only effectively disappears from the power sector under the Ambitious Climate scenarios. Under the less ambitious scenarios, it falls from 60 percent of the power mix to 9, 10, and 20 percent of the total in IEA STEPS, Equinor Walls, and IEEJ Reference scenarios, respectively. Although nuclear is usually expected to grow in substantially in absolute terms—rising from about 400 TWh today to 900 TWh or more in 2050 in all six scenarios—it nonetheless remains a relatively small player in the overall generation mix.\\n\\n### Figure 21. Electricity Generation in China, by Fuel\\n\\n![Image 25: Figure 21](https://media.rff.org/images/Figure_21_yvdZ1qu.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Other is computed as the difference between the reported total and all other categories.\\n\\n4. Data and Methods\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn this paper, we examined projections from the following publications:\\n\\n*   BNEF: New Energy Outlook 2024\\n*   bp: Energy Outlook 2024\\n*   Equinor: Energy Perspectives 2024\\n*   ExxonMobil: 2024 Outlook for Energy\\n*   IEA: World Energy Outlook 2024\\n*   IEEJ: Energy Outlook 2024\\n*   OPEC: World Oil Outlook 2024\\n\\nThese outlooks vary across a variety of dimensions, including modeling techniques, historical data, economic growth assumptions, and policy scenarios. Generally, scenarios can be grouped into three categories: (1) Reference, which assume no major policy changes; (2) Evolving Policies, which incorporate the modeling team’s expectations of policy trends; and (3) alternatives, which are typically based on certain policy targets or technology assumptions. We focus on Ambitious Climate scenarios, a major subset of (3). Table 3 summarizes the scenarios included in this year’s analysis.\\n\\n### Table 3. Sources and Scenarios\\n\\n![Image 26: table 3](https://media.rff.org/images/table_3_ypkgLp4.width-1480.png)\\n\\n### 4.1. Harmonization\\n\\nVariations in underlying assumptions about the future of policies, technologies, and markets produce useful variation among outlooks, allowing analysts to view a wide range of potential energy futures. However, outlooks also have important methodological differences, which can complicate direct comparisons and reduce the ability to draw insights.\\n\\nOne major difference is the choice of reporting units. For primary energy, outlooks use different energy units, such as QBtu, million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe), or exajoules (EJ). In this report, we standardize all units to QBtu. For fuel-specific data, outlooks also vary, using million barrels per day (mbd) or million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboed) for liquid fuels, billion cubic meters (bcm) or trillion cubic feet (tcf) for natural gas, million tonnes of coal-equivalent (mtce) or million short tons (mst) for coal, and Terawatt hours (TWh) or Gigawatt hours (GWh) for electricity generation. Table 4 presents the reporting units for each outlook, and Table 5 provides relevant conversion factors.\\n\\n### Table 4. Units of Energy Consumption, by Outlook\\n\\n![Image 27: Table 4](https://media.rff.org/images/Table_4_kvaFZv2.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Units are per year unless the unit abbreviation indicates otherwise. N/A indicates that fuel-specific data are not available for a given source.\\n\\n### Table 5. Conversion Factors for Key Energy Units\\n\\n![Image 28: Table 5](https://media.rff.org/images/Table_5_ZRNOHlJ.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: There is no agreed-upon factor for boe. IEA reports that typical factors range from 7.15 to 7.40 boe per toe, and OPEC uses a conversion factor of 7.33 boe per toe. We derive 1.976 QBtu/mboed by multiplying 49.8 mtoe/mboed (=1 toe / 7.33 boe * 365 days per year) by 0.03968 QBtu/mtoe.\\n\\nA second key difference among outlooks is that assumptions about the energy content in a given physical unit of fuel result in different conversion factors for data presented in energy units (e.g., QBtu) versus physical units (e.g., mbd or bcm). Among the outlooks we examine, these assumptions vary by up to 10 percent. Although conversion unit variations may appear small, they are amplified when applied across the massive scale of global energy systems, particularly over a long time horizon.\\n\\nA third major difference results from varying decisions about including nonmarketed biomass, such as locally gathered wood and dung, in historical data and projections for primary energy consumption. In previous years, bp and the EIA had not included these sources in their projections. However, bp’s Energy Outlook 2024 does include nonmarketed biomass, allowing for enhanced comparability.\\n\\nYet another difference relates to comparing the energy content of fossil and nonfossil fuels. The primary energy content of oil, natural gas, and coal is relatively well understood and similar across outlooks. However, a substantial portion of that embodied energy is wasted as heat during combustion. Because nonfossil fuels, such as hydroelectricity, wind, and solar, do not generate substantial waste heat, identifying a comparable metric for primary energy is difficult, and outlooks take a variety of approaches.\\n\\nOther differences in outlooks include (1) different categorizations for liquid fuels and renewable energy, (2) different regional groupings for aggregated data and projections, (3) net versus gross calorific values when reporting energy content of fossil fuels, (4) net versus gross generation when reporting electricity data, and (5) whether and how flared natural gas is included in energy consumption data.\\n\\nTo address those challenges and allow for a more accurate comparison across outlooks, Newell and Iler use a harmonization process, which we update and apply here. In previous years, we have included a methodology report (see Raimi and Newell). This year’s report follows the same process outlined in that report but with updated numbers.

Regional totals may not sum because of different treatment of international aviation and bunker fuels and, for IEA, excluding biofuels in regional data. Where volumetric data are not published, we assume a conversion factor of 1.832 QBtu per mbd, or 0.54585 mbd per QBtu.\\n\\n### Table 9.

OPEC does not present electricity generation data. Equinor and ExxonMobil include geothermal in “other.” Biomass/waste also includes biogas.\\n\\n### Table 14. Net Carbon Dioxide Emissions, by Region\\n\\n![Image 37: Table 14](https://media.rff.org/images/Table_14.width-1480.png)\\n\\nNotes: Historical data from bp Statistical Review of World Energy. Net CO₂ emissions include positive (gross) and negative emissions from sources such as direct air capture and bioenergy with CCS. CO₂ emissions data include fossil fuel combustion and exclude industrial process emissions. Regional data from bp and IEA are excluded because they include methane emissions (bp), flaring (bp), and industrial process emissions (bp and IEA). Equinor Bridges emissions are negative in 2050, making it impossible to calculate a compound average annual growth rate.\\n\\nEndnotes\\n--------\\n\\n1.   Grubler, A. 2008. Energy Transitions.

      "    \"content\": \"Geopolitical risks remain pivotal, with ongoing tensions in the Middle East and sanctions on oil-exporting nations such as Iran and Venezuela threatening supply disruptions. While OPEC+ production cuts continue to provide vital support to prices by tightening global supply, these efforts are partially offset by the rising output of non-OPEC producers, notably in the U.S. and Canada. [...] The return of a Trump-led U.S. administration introduces additional challenges. Deregulation policies aimed at boosting domestic oil production may exert downward pressure on prices, while potential trade tariffs and revised international agreements could further complicate global oil flows.\",\n",

Leonard Herchen & Yuchen Wang**\\n\\n**Overview:**\\n-------------\\n\\nThe energy markets in 2025 are undergoing transformative structural changes, highlighted by the operational launch of key infrastructure projects such as LNG Canada. This development significantly enhances Canada’s ability to meet rising global LNG demand while alleviating long-standing supply bottlenecks. At the same time, economic recovery across major markets remains uneven, shaping varied trends in energy demand and production activity.\\n\\nGeopolitical dynamics are poised to redefine the competitive landscape, with the return of a Trump-led U.S. administration introducing potential shifts in trade policies, regulatory frameworks, and relationships with leading energy-producing nations. These changes, coupled with climate policy advancements and an accelerated global transition toward renewable energy, present additional complexities for the oil and gas sector.\\n\\nAmid these uncertainties, GLJ’s analysts express confidence in the resilience of market fundamentals. Their long-term real price forecast projects WTI at **USD $74.00 per barrel** and Henry Hub natural gas at **USD $4.00 per MMBtu** in 2025 dollars, signaling expectations of market stabilization and sustained global demand.\\n\\n### **Oil Prices**\\n\\nThe oil market in 2025 reflects a delicate balance between supply and demand. During Q4 2024, WTI prices remained stable, fluctuating between $69 and $73 per barrel. This stability highlights the market’s resilience, even in the face of a slower global economic recovery and geopolitical challenges, including weaker demand in regions like China and increased production in North America.\\n\\nGeopolitical risks remain pivotal, with ongoing tensions in the Middle East and sanctions on oil-exporting nations such as Iran and Venezuela threatening supply disruptions. While OPEC+ production cuts continue to provide vital support to prices by tightening global supply, these efforts are partially offset by the rising output of non-OPEC producers, notably in the U.S. and Canada.\\n\\nThe Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) project is reshaping the pricing dynamics of WCS crude relative to WTI. By increasing export capacity to the West Coast, TMX has created conditions for a sustained narrowing of the WCS-WTI differential, moving away from seasonal fluctuations.\\n\\nThe return of a Trump-led U.S. administration introduces additional challenges. Deregulation policies aimed at boosting domestic oil production may exert downward pressure on prices, while potential trade tariffs and revised international agreements could further complicate global oil flows.\\n\\nIn this dynamic environment, GLJ forecasts WTI to average $71.25 per barrel and Brent $75.25 per barrel in 2025. These projections reflect robust long-term fundamentals, including sustained global demand and ongoing efforts to manage supply dynamics, emphasizing the market’s resilience despite near-term uncertainties.\\n\\n### **Natural Gas Prices**\\n\\nIn 2025, GLJ’s forecast suggests Henry Hub prices will average $3.20 per MMBtu, supported by steady domestic demand, seasonal winter peaks, and robust LNG exports. U.S. natural gas continues to play a critical role globally, ensuring supply security for key markets in Europe and Asia. The combination of growing industrial use, power generation demand, and stable production levels provides a solid foundation for price stability.\\n\\nFor the Canadian market, GLJ projects AECO natural gas prices to average $2.05 per MMBtu in 2025, representing a recovery from the lows of 2024. This improvement is attributed to easing regional oversupply and stabilizing demand. However, challenges persist, as production continues to outpace infrastructure expansion, prompting a downward adjustment of GLJ’s long-term AECO price forecast by $0.40 per MMBtu. The ramp-up of LNG Canada’s operations is expected to progressively enhance market dynamics and address these challenges.\\n\\nOn a global scale, LNG benchmarks such as NBP, TTF, and JKM have remained relatively stable, supported by high storage levels in Europe and balanced supply-demand conditions. European suppliers have effectively managed storage drawdowns, ensuring sufficient reserves for winter. Nevertheless, these benchmarks remain susceptible to market volatility driven by geopolitical uncertainties.\\n\\n### **The CAD/USD Exchange Rate**\\n\\nThe Canadian dollar experienced sharp depreciation during the last quarter of 2024, with the CAD/USD exchange rate falling below 0.70 USD. Economists have attributed this decline to the strength of the U.S. economy and its currency, the widening gap between the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s lending rates, as well as tariff threats and a political crisis in Ottawa. These factors have created a favorable environment for the U.S. dollar, putting downward pressure on the Canadian dollar.\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, GLJ forecasts a CAD/USD exchange rate averaging 0.705 USD, underpinned by steady oil and gas revenues and enhanced export capacity from major projects such as LNG Canada and the TMX and eventual resolution of internal political issues and return to normalcy in US tariff policy.\\n\\nNevertheless, the outlook for the Canadian dollar remains uncertain, shaped by global economic recovery—particularly in China—and U.S. policy decisions under the Trump administration. While near-term challenges persist, Canada’s resource-driven economy and strategic energy export position provide a degree of resilience. In the absence of significant economic or geopolitical disruptions, GLJ projects the CAD/USD exchange rate to stabilize around 0.75 USD over the long term.\\n\\nIn 2025, GLJ expanded its database to include forecasts for Colombia Vasconia and Castilla Crude, as well as lithium prices, reflecting the increasing focus on diverse energy and resource markets. The addition of lithium forecasts aligns with the growing global emphasis on energy transition minerals critical for electric vehicles and battery storage solutions. A separate blog, set to be published next week on the GLJ website, will explore the lithium price forecast in greater depth, offering a detailed analysis and strategic implications for the energy sector.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGLJ’s forecast values for key benchmarks is as follows:\\n\\n![Image 22: 2025 energy outlook table](https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-Energy-Outlook-Table.png)\\n\\n  \\n  \\nShare This:\\n\\n[Email](https://energynow.com/#email \\\"Email\\\")[Facebook](https://energynow.com/#facebook \\\"Facebook\\\")[Twitter](https://energynow.com/#twitter \\\"Twitter\\\")[LinkedIn](https://energynow.com/#linkedin \\\"LinkedIn\\\")\\n\\n  \\n  \\n\\n### Previous Article\\n\\n  [Alleviate the Headaches of Workforce Travel](https://energynow.com/2025/01/alleviate-the-headaches-of-workforce-travel/)\\n\\n### Next Article\\n\\n[GLJ’s Lithium Price Forecast: Insights for a Dynamic Market](https://energynow.com/2025/01/gljs-lithium-price-forecast-insights-for-a-dynamic-market/)  \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n#### More News Articles\\n\\n[Chevron’s Strategic Path to Sustainability: Cutting Methane Emissions with Kathairos Solutions Innovative Technology](https://energynow.com/2025/03/chevrons-strategic-path-to-sustainability-cutting-methane-emissions-with-kathairos-solutions-innovative-technology/)\\n\\n[The Crucial Role of Geospatial Data in Land Planning for Energy Professionals](https://energynow.com/2025/03/the-crucial-role-of-geospatial-data-in-land-planning-for-energy-professionals/)\\n\\n[Unlocking the Power of Data in the Energy Sector](https://energynow.com/2025/03/unlocking-the-power-of-data-in-the-energy-sector/)\\n\\n[Navigating H2S Hotspots: Streamline Your Reporting with XI Technologies](https://energynow.com/2025/03/navigating-h2s-hotspots-streamline-your-reporting-with-xi-technologies/)\\n\\n  \\n\\nCategories [Featured Articles](https://energynow.com/category/featured_articles/)\\n\\n[Canada Tilts Right: Inflation Claims Trudeau as Its Latest Victim](https://energynow.com/2025/01/canada-tilts-right-inflation-claims-trudeau-as-its-latest-victim/)\\n\\n[Trump Weighing Executive Order Protecting Gas Stoves](https://energynow.com/2025/01/trump-weighing-executive-order-protecting-gas-stoves/)\\n\\nFEATURED EVENT\\n--------------\\n\\n[![Image 23: Reuters Events -

Recent declarations by President Donald Trump, coupled with deliberations at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, have introduced new variables influencing energy production, distribution, and consumption.\\n\\nThis article delves into the current state of the energy landscape, identifies potential developments, and examines international perspectives shaping the future of energy.\\n\\n ![Image 10: Wind turbines at sunrise](https://kyivconsulting.com/public/assets/img/energy-market-2025-policy-shifts-tech-disruptions-and-industry-insights-img1.jpg)\\n\\nCurrent State of the Energy Sector\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nIn January 2025, President Trump announced a comprehensive plan to bolster fossil fuel production, declaring a national energy emergency to expedite permitting processes and withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement. These actions signify a sharp departure from previous climate policies, prioritizing energy independence and economic growth over emission reductions. As part of this shift, the administration has also expanded oil and gas drilling on federal lands, raising concerns among renewable energy advocates. In particular, wind energy has faced increasing scrutiny, with recent statements questioning its efficiency and economic viability.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos 2025 has emphasized the urgency of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy sources. Global leaders and industry experts highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships and increased investments in clean technologies, aiming to counteract the growing reliance on fossil fuels. Discussions at the WEF also underscored a widening divide in global energy strategies - with some countries reinforcing traditional energy sources, while others push forward with ambitious renewable initiatives.\\n\\nFor example, the United Kingdom’s renewable energy sector continues to thrive, with nearly 58% of its electricity coming from renewables in 2024. Innovative projects like Xlinks, which plans to import solar-generated electricity from Morocco, highlight new strategies for sustainable energy security.\\n\\nMoreover, the emergence of AI technologies, such as China's DeepSeek, has raised concerns about future energy demand due to their low-cost, low-energy models. This development has led to significant market reactions, including a decline in tech shares and fluctuations in oil prices.\\n\\nThese developments underscore a critical shift in global energy dynamics, where economic priorities, technological advancements, and geopolitical factors will determine the trajectory of the energy sector in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n![Image 11: Oil rigs in the ocean](https://kyivconsulting.com/public/assets/img/energy-market-2025-policy-shifts-tech-disruptions-and-industry-insights-img2.jpg)\\n\\nENERGY SHIFTS\\n\\nKey Trends Shaping the Energy Sector\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n01\\n\\n### Fossil Fuel Production\\n\\nThe U.S. administration's recent directives aim to increase domestic oil and gas output, potentially influencing global energy markets and pricing structures.\\n\\n02\\n\\n### Renewable Energy Initiatives\\n\\nDespite policy shifts favoring fossil fuels, there is a continued global momentum toward renewable energy investments, driven by technological advancements and decreasing costs.\\n\\n03\\n\\n### Advanced Technologies\\n\\nThe rising energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers are prompting investments in advanced power generation and grid management solutions to ensure reliability and efficiency.\\n\\n ![Image 12: Hydropower molecular](https://kyivconsulting.com/public/assets/img/energy-market-2025-policy-shifts-tech-disruptions-and-industry-insights-img3.jpg)\\n\\nGlobal Perspectives and Strategic Directions\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nInternationally, countries are navigating the balance between energy security and sustainability.\\n\\nIndustry leaders, such as Ineos Energy Chairman Brian Gilvary, have expressed concerns regarding the rapid implementation of Net Zero initiatives. They warn that an accelerated push could lead to inflation, power shortages, and increased strain on energy grids, advocating for a more balanced approach to the energy transition.\\n\\nDiscussions at the World Economic Forum have emphasized that the energy transition and energy security are not mutually exclusive, advocating for strategies that simultaneously address both objectives. Nations are exploring diversified energy portfolios, incorporating both traditional and renewable sources, to enhance resilience against geopolitical and market fluctuations.\\n\\nCharting the Path Forward\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe energy sector in 2025 is at a crossroads, influenced by policy decisions, technological innovations, and global collaborations. Stakeholders must navigate these complexities to develop strategies that ensure energy security, economic viability, and environmental sustainability. Continuous monitoring of policy developments and active participation in international dialogues will be crucial for organizations aiming to thrive in this evolving landscape.\\n\\nIn this dynamic environment, [data-driven research](https://kyivconsulting.com/services/research-and-analytics-hub) is essential for making informed decisions - whether entering new markets, investing in energy infrastructure, or adapting to regulatory shifts.\\n\\n[Request Research ![Image 13](https://kyivconsulting.com/public/assets/img/btn-bg-arrow-52061402.svg)](https://kyivconsulting.com/request-for-proposal)\\n\\nOUR INSIGHTS\\n\\n### Recent Discoveries\\n\\n[![Image 14](https://kyivconsulting.com/public/assets/img/what-investors-need-to-know-before-investing-in-ukraine-in-2025-buffer.jpg)](https://kyivconsulting.com/insights/what-investors-need-to-know-before-investing-in-ukraine-in-2025)\\n\\n[What Investors Need to Know Before Investing in Ukraine in 2025](https://kyivconsulting.com/insights/what-investors-need-to-know-before-investing-in-ukraine-in-2025)\\n\\nLooking to invest in Ukraine?

and U.S. production rises will also taper off, due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s [tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) on trading partners and their retaliatory moves, the International Energy Agency said.\\n\\nTrump's tariffs, along with a supply hike by OPEC+ producers, have driven a steep slide in [oil prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-rise-potential-us-tariff-exemptions-cars-pick-up-china-crude-imports-2025-04-15/) this month, cutting revenue for producers. The U.S. oil industry, despite calls by Trump to \\\"drill baby drill\\\", may actually slow activity, the IEA said.\\n\\nThe Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/reuters-power-up/?location=article-paragraph)\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\nWorld oil demand this year will rise by 730,000 barrels per day, the IEA, which advises industrialised countries, said in a monthly report on Tuesday, a sharp cut from 1.03 million bpd expected last month. The reduction is larger than a cut made on Monday by [producer group OPEC](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-cuts-2025-global-oil-demand-growth-forecast-citing-us-tariffs-2025-04-14/).\\n\\n\\\"The deteriorating outlook for the global economy amid the sudden sharp escalation in trade tensions in early April has prompted a downgrade to our forecast for oil demand growth this year,\\\" the IEA said.\\n\\n\\\"Roughly half of this downgrade occurs in the United States and China, with most of the remainder in trade-oriented Asian economies.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\nGrowth of 730,000 bpd would be the lowest since 2020, when demand contracted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the pandemic, it would be the lowest since 2019, when growth was 540,000 bpd, the IEA said in response to a Reuters question.\\n\\nIn its first look at 2026, the IEA predicted a further slowdown in demand growth to 690,000 bpd, due to a fragile economic backdrop and growing penetration of electric vehicles.\\n\\nIn China, economic challenges and a shift towards EVs are tempering oil growth prospects in the world's second-largest consumer, which had driven rises in oil consumption for years.\\n\\nGlobal oil prices have dropped by 13% this month to around $64 a barrel, pressured by trade tensions and the decision of OPEC+ producers to accelerate a supply hike in May. Crude edged lower on Tuesday after the IEA report's release.\\n\\nAn aerial view shows a crude oil tanker at an oil terminal off Waidiao island in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, China January 4, 2023.

These were both down 150,000 bpd from last month's figures.\\n\\nOPEC's oil demand view is at the higher end of industry forecasts and it expects oil use to keep rising for years, unlike the IEA,

CC BY 4.0. Abstract Energy supply security remains a central pillar of the global policy agenda as international oil trade flows are upended by wide-ranging sanctions on Russia and attacks on tankers transiting the critical Red Sea shipping corridor. At the same time, Asia’s growing structural shortfall in crude and oil products and the ever-expanding supply surplus in the Atlantic Basin are creating new trade routes in the global oil market. This eastward shift to non-OECD Asia, especially China and India, is coinciding with a multitude of new challenges driving oil market activity as the energy transition gathers pace. Increased use of EVs, emerging clean energy technologies and more expansive efficiency policies are combining to chart a much slower growth trajectory for oil demand, plateauing towards the end of our 2023-2030 forecast period. Oil 24, the IEA’s medium-term outlook, explores these critical developments and their impact on the global oil market. Oil 2024 looks beyond the short-term horizon covered in the IEA’s monthly Oil Market Report to provide a comprehensive overview of evolving oil supply and demand dynamics through to 2030. The report provides detailed analysis and forecasts of oil demand fundamentals across fuels, sectors and regions. It also outlines projected supply from planned upstream and downstream projects around the world. Our findings provide compelling insights on spare production capacity, product supply and trade flows, as well as the implications of surging output of natural gas liquids (NGLs) in this era of petrochemical-driven demand growth.

CC BY 4.0. Executive summary Global oil markets navigate a challenging landscape Global oil markets will need to traverse myriad challenges in the medium-term as structural shifts reshape oil demand and trade flows, while rising oil supplies could potentially weigh on prices through the end of the decade. Divergent regional economic trajectories and the accelerating deployment of clean and energy-saving technologies are combining to progressively slow the pace of oil demand growth, with a plateau emerging in the final years of our forecast, which runs to 2030. Emerging economies in Asia, particularly China and India, account for all of global demand growth. By contrast, oil demand in advanced economies falls sharply. Rising world oil supplies, led by non-OPEC+ producers, are expected to surpass forecast demand from 2025 onwards. Mirroring demand’s break with long-term trends, a front-loaded build in oil production capacity is forecast to lose momentum and swing into contraction towards the end of our medium-term outlook. A surge in natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensates will account for 45% of new capacity increases over the forecast period. In a major shift in strategy, Saudi Arabia has put on hold its planned crude oil capacity increase and will now focus on expanding natural gas liquids and condensates, which aligns with its efforts to boost domestic gas supply. It may also reflect an acknowledgment of the rapidly building surplus in global crude oil production capacity. The rise of petrochemicals as the main pillar of global demand growth largely tracks the substantial increase in global supply of NGLs, which are instrumental in their production. At the same time, these changes will also create new challenges for refiners as demand for refined products is displaced by non-refined products such as NGLs and biofuels. Non-refined fuels are set to capture a staggering three-quarters of projected global demand growth over the 2023-2030 period. Moreover, refiners will need to reconfigure their product slates to meet divergent trends for distillates amid reduced consumption as the energy transition accelerates. This is especially the case in road transport fuels as EVs rapidly increase their market share. Amid all these structural changes to supply and demand patterns, the global oil market outlook faces further uncertainties from weaker macroeconomic expectations, new government policies and regulations to fast-track the energy transition, and an unprecedented level of investment to scale up more efficient technologies. Oil 2024 Executive summary PAGE | 7 I EA. CC BY 4.0. While the challenges are formidable, the industry has consistently proved its adaptability to dramatic supply and demand changes, including from the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic before that. Surplus global supply capacity will reach unprecedented levels by 2030 A ramping up of world oil production capacity, led by the United States and other producers in the Americas, is expected to outstrip demand growth over the 2023-2030 forecast period and inflate the world’s spare capacity cushion to levels that are unprecedented, barring the Covid-19 period. Total supply capacity rises by 6 mb/d to nearly 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a staggering 8 mb/d above projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d. OPEC+ spare crude production capacity and implied total oil stock build, 2016-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Notes: Projections based on the current OPEC+ supply agreement. OPEC+ countries are crude oil only. Assumes Iran and Russia remain under sanctions. Implied oil stock builds include total oil. Such a massive cushion could upend the current OPEC+ market management strategy aimed at supporting prices. For now, the producer alliance has laid out a roadmap for unwinding extra voluntary cuts of up to 2.2 mb/d from Q4 2024 to Q3 2025. But this outlook is subject to their caveat that the production increases can be paused or reversed depending on market conditions. A lower price environment would ultimately challenge the US shale industry, traditionally the fastest respondent to changing market circumstances. How the industry will adapt and adjust to the new supply landscape will have wide-ranging consequences for producers and consumers globally through the remainder of the decade and beyond. 0 2 4 6 8 10 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Implied oil stock build Off mkt due to sanctions Other OPEC+ Iraq UAE Saudi Arabia Oil 2024 Executive summary PAGE | 8 I EA. CC BY 4.0. World oil demand tempered by clean energy transition Based on today’s market conditions and policies, global oil demand will level off at around 106 mb/d towards the end of the decade amid the accelerating transition to clean energy technologies. Surging EV sales and continued efficiency improvements of vehicles, and the substitution of oil with renewables or gas in the power sector, will significantly curb oil use in road transport and electricity generation. Total oil demand is nevertheless forecast to rise by 3.2 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, supported by increased use of jet fuel and feedstocks from the booming petrochemical sector. Indeed, consumption of naphtha, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane will climb by 3.7 mb/d over the forecast period, fuelled also by growth in LPG use for clean cooking. World oil demand dominated by growth in petrochemical feedstocks IEA. CC BY 4.0. Growth will be dominated by Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s pivot to emerging markets continues. Demand from the two Asian economic powerhouses will develop in very different ways, however. In China, growth is set to be driven by the petrochemical sector as rapid deployment of clean energy technologies and massive infrastructure investments in high-speed rail blunt demand for transport fuels. In India, transport fuels will defy the global trend, rising sharply. Significant gains will also come from other emerging and developing economies in Asia. By contrast, demand in advanced economies will continue its decades-long decline, falling from 45.7 mb/d in 2023 to 42.7 mb/d by 2030. Apart from during the pandemic, the last time demand was this low was in 1991. Over that same time period, oil demand from emerging and developing economies will have increased by a factor of 2.5. 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Others Biofuels Petrochemical Feedstocks Total Oil demand, 2017-2030 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Growth in oil demand, 2022-2030 Oil 2024 Executive summary PAGE | 9 I EA. CC BY 4.0. Upstream investments and oil supply on the rise In line with the ascendancy of petrochemicals as the anchor of global oil demand growth, 45% of the supply capacity increase over the forecast period comes from NGLs and condensates. While Saudi Arabia has shelved its planned crude capacity increase from 12 mb/d to 13 mb/d, its development of the massive Jafurah gas field will move ahead. This will result in a substantial ramping up of gas liquids output of almost 1 mb/d by 2030, volumes that are not subject to OPEC+ quotas. Strong gains in US NGLs are also expected. Total NGLs and condensates are projected to rise by 2.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030. By comparison, crude oil production capacity is forecast to increase by 2.6 mb/d over the same period, while biofuels account for 620 kb/d of the 6 mb/d total. Non-OPEC+ producers will continue to lead the capacity build, accounting for 4.6 mb/d, or 76% of the net increase. The United States alone makes up 2.1 mb/d of the non-OPEC+ gains, while Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina contribute a further 2.7 mb/d. As the sanctioned project queue fizzles out towards the end of our forecast, growth stalls in the United States and Canada while Brazil and Guyana shift into decline based on current plans. However, should companies swiftly approve additional projects that are already on the drawing board, an incremental 1.3 mb/d of non-OPEC+ capacity could become operational by 2030. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iraq lead a 1.4 mb/d rise in OPEC+ oil capacity as African and Asian members post declines. The UAE and Iraq are raising crude oil capacity while Saudi Arabia is poised for a significant increase NGL and condensates supply. Capacity in Russia is expected to show only a marginal decline despite international sanctions as the giant Vostok project ramps up, helping to offset losses at mature oil fields. The boost in supply follows a steady increase in upstream investments. Global upstream capital expenditures rose by 13% to an eight-year high of USD 538 billion in 2023 and are on track to increase by another 7% this year. Refiners adjust to slowing demand for refined fuels Global refining capacity is forecast to rise by 3.3 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, well below historical trends. Even with the moderate expansion in capacity, the increase outpaces the call on refined products over the period. Refiners will need to progressively modify their product output to meet divergent trends for distillates as gasoline demand falls amid an increase in the market share of electric vehicles while jet fuel consumption rises. In addition, non-refined fuels such as NGLs and biofuels further undermine demand for refined product supplies and the need for additional refining capacity. Non-refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of projected demand growth over the 2023-2030 period. Oil 2024 Executive summary PAGE | 10 I EA. CC BY 4.0. This significant rise in non-refinery product supplies will add pressure on operating rates and refinery profitability, especially in mature demand centres. That raises the prospect of further capacity closures by the end of the decade. Capacity growth will remain concentrated in Asia, most notably in China and India, but post-2027 there are signs of expansions slowing. Global oil trade will continue its eastward shift Global oil trade will continue to be dictated by Asia’s growing structural shortfall in crude and product supply and the expanding surplus of crude, NGLs and products in the Atlantic Basin. Rising non-OPEC+ crude supply, in tandem with sanctions on Russian crude exports and OPEC+ voluntary cuts, will push higher volumes from the Atlantic Basin to East of Suez over the outlook period. Net crude oil exports versus Asian import requirement, 2019-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0 The loss of medium sour crudes from the Middle East amid OPEC+ cuts is partially offset by rising supplies from Brazil, Guyana and Canada. Asian markets have been opened in earnest to Canadian crude through the expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline to the Pacific Coast. Light sweet US crude oil will increasingly move to Europe and Africa as well as to India and other Asian refiners. As the dominant centre of oil product demand growth, Asia will attract a greater share of product supply from the broader region, notably from the Middle East. Supplies from Russia, which are subject to sanctions in much of the Atlantic Basin, will continue to head eastward, although Africa and Latin America may also boost imports over time. Europe’s shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition most keenly in the middle distillate markets. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Atlantic Basin (ex-Russia) Russia Middle East Asian Crude Deficit Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 11 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Demand Global summary World oil demand on course to plateau by 2030 Oil demand growth will slow progressively over the rest of the decade. The post-pandemic rebound has faded, macroeconomic drivers remain weak and the accelerating deployment of clean energy technologies weighs heavily on key sectors and regions. Growth decelerates from 2.1 mb/d in 2023, with demand plateauing at 105.6 mb/d by 2029, and then shifting into a narrow contraction in the final year of our medium-term outlook. This slow erosion in global demand growth results in a net increase of 3.2 mb/d during the 2023-2030 forecast period. Growth will be dominated by non-OECD Asian economies, especially India and China, as oil demand’s decades-long pivot to emerging markets continues. Total non-OECD demand is forecast to rise 6.1 mb/d by 2030. While road transport use will ease as vehicle electrification gathers pace, significant potential remains for incremental jet fuel and petrochemical feedstock consumption. By contrast, the OECD, led by Europe and Americas, will post a sharp decline of 2.9 mb/d over the forecast period. Shifting patterns of use, with most growth taking place in non-combustion applications like petrochemicals and a higher share of biofuels, mean that CO2 emissions from oil use could peak as early as 2026.

Oil demand growth to decouple from slower GDP expansion The global economy has so far proved resilient during the unprecedented central bank interest rate hikes of 2022-2023 that coincided with the end to the post-Covid economic (and inflationary) rebound. These campaigns can be considered largely successful in that consumer inflation – although still above-target – has eased considerably, while economic activity remained mostly robust. Still, the long-term impact of this bout of monetary tightening is undetermined, especially in developed countries. Here, GDP growth remains subpar at 1-2% over the forecast period amid lacklustre manufacturing and trade, and tight credit conditions. On a global level, this is partly counterbalanced by robust growth in non-OECD economies, averaging 4% in India and other Asian countries. While China’s growth will also settle around this level, this marks a sharp deceleration from the country’s overleveraged 1990-2010 boom years, with the protracted property slump weighing on economic sentiment. Consequently, global GDP growth is set to remain around half a percent below its 2010s pre-pandemic trend at an average annual rate of 3% over the forecasting period. Growth in global oil demand and GDP, 2011-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Excludes 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19 distortions. Now that the pandemic period (when public health restrictions drove changes in oil demand) has concluded, economic fundamentals are set to regain their traditional role as main drivers of oil demand, albeit only briefly. Global oil demand growth of about 1 mb/d in 2024 and 2025 is roughly in line with the level implied by GDP growth. However, this long-established correlation is set to break down in 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 -0.5% 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 2.6% 2.8% 3.0% 3.2% 3.4% 3.6% 3.8% 4.0% 4.2% Oil demand growth GDP growth 2011-2023 Forecast 2024-2030 Forecast without substitution Pre-pandemic trend Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 13 IEA. CC BY 4.0. subsequent years. Oil consumption effectively decouples from GDP from 2026 onwards, as substitution away from oil in transport and power generation pushes oil demand growth towards zero, and eventually into decline. Emerging Asia and petrochemicals dominate growth The substitution effect is especially prominent in transport – the mainstay of oil demand – with road fuel demand already plateauing this year, and total transport close behind. EV sales are set to continue their stellar growth trajectory, resulting in significant fuel savings. This will displace 6 mb/d of gasoline and diesel demand by 2030, with a further contribution from improving fuel economies. Post-pandemic changes in consumer mobility behaviour contribute a further 1 mb/d in transport fuel savings as remote and hybrid work are now well established. The picture for public transport use is more mixed – city mass transit ridership has not yet regained 2019 levels in developed countries, partly because consumers shifted to car journeys. Conversely, in China public transport rebounded to pre-Covid levels in the immediate aftermath of the country’s reopening, while highway passenger volumes remain at around half of 2019 levels, according to data reported by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The displacement of oil used in electricity generation will also play a major role in shifting global demand to a plateau. In particular, Saudi Arabia has plans that would see about 1 mb/d cut from direct crude, fuel oil and gasoil use in power plants by 2030. A large increase in utilisation of domestic gas and renewable resources would enable this. Iraq is also expected to reduce oil burn in power plants, albeit on a smaller scale.

Long-distance transport such as aviation and marine shipping, where demand is less amenable to direct substitution, will continue to post growth. However, here fuel efficiencies are increasingly slowing demand gains. Global flight activity regained pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2023, but at present jet/kerosene use remains about 5% below 2019 levels. Consumption is not expected to surpass pre-Covid levels until 2027, with healthy underlying demand for air travel counterbalanced by major strides in aircraft fuel efficiencies. Along the same line, efficiencies related to regulations by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are set to gradually erode consumption of marine fuels. World oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 In a marked contrast to the increasingly anaemic gains in transport fuels, petrochemical feedstocks will be the cornerstones of overall growth, as global polymer and synthetic fibre consumption steadily rises. Naphtha and LPG/ethane use will climb by a combined 3.7 mb/d over the forecast period. Four-fifths of this increment will be for deliveries to petrochemical plants, with growth in LPG demand for clean cooking and other domestic applications also playing a major role. Especially strong growth for LPG/ethane use – up by 2.5 mb/d between 2023 and 2030 – reflects substantial increases in new NGL supply, notably from the United States and major Middle Eastern producers. China will continue to dominate growth in petrochemicals and gains of 1.4 mb/d in feedstock products will be close to the country’s overall increase to 2030. On the other hand, rapid deployment of clean energy technologies will balance strong underlying mobility growth. Climbing EV sales and the impacts of infrastructure investments such as high-speed rail have blunted gasoline demand growth and China’s use of the fuel is set to peak by 2025. In India transport fuels will defy the global trend and increase significantly. Indian demand is expected to rise by 1.3 mb/d, with growth almost equal to that of its northern neighbour. Combined gains in all non-OECD Asian economies other than China and India will be even larger at 1.6 mb/d. Together, emerging Asian economies will be far and away the most important source of oil demand growth this decade. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 13.1 13.3 13.7 14.1 14.6 15.0 15.4 15.8 16.2 16.5 16.8 17.1 2.3% 2.5 Naphtha 6.7 6.6 7.1 6.9 7.3 7.5 7.7 7.9 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.5 2.2% 1.2 Gasoline 26.9 23.7 25.7 26.3 27.0 27.2 27.2 27.0 26.7 26.4 26.0 25.4 -0.8% -1.6 Jet/Kerosene 7.9 4.7 5.1 6.2 7.2 7.5 7.6 7.8 8.0 8.1 8.3 8.5 2.4% 1.3 Gasoil/Diesel 28.3 26.1 27.6 28.4 28.5 28.4 28.8 28.9 28.9 28.9 28.8 28.7 0.1% 0.2 Residual fuel oil 6.2 5.8 6.4 6.5 6.4 6.5 6.5 6.5 6.4 6.4 6.3 6.3 -0.3% -0.1 Other products 11.5 11.6 11.8 11.8 11.3 11.0 11.1 11.1 11.1 11.1 11.1 11.0 -0.4% -0.4 Total products 100.6 91.7 97.5 100.1 102.2 103.2 104.2 105.0 105.3 105.5 105.6 105.4 0.4% 3.2 Annual change 0.5 -8.9 5.8 2.6 2.1 1.0 1.0 0.7 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.1 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 15 IEA.

In 2007, OECD demand was 50.2 mb/d and accounted for 57% of global oil use. By 2019 this had fallen to 47.5 mb/d (47% of the total) and in 2023 deliveries averaged 45.7 mb/d (45%). By 2030, OECD consumption will drop to 42.7 mb/d, 41% of the global total. Advanced economies have comparatively low GDP elasticities and can expect more limited economic growth. In general, they have also implemented ambitious clean energy policies. As a result, OECD countries will experience the largest declines in transport fuel demand and smaller rises in jet fuel demand.

CC BY 4.0. There are various risks to our demand forecast, of which assumptions about economic growth, oil prices and the pace of EV sales are key. Also, deviations for these factors are likely to be interdependent – for example, a faster pace of GDP growth is likely to be accompanied by higher oil prices and quicker EV adoption. Moreover, oil’s flattish, plateauing demand profile post-2027 means that it would only take relatively minor changes in its underlying drivers to directionally shift oil’s demand trajectory. For example, either a 0.3% quickening in global GDP growth, a USD 5/bbl annual decline in real oil prices or a 15% slowdown in the pace of global EV adoption would be sufficient for oil consumption to cross the narrow dividing line back from shrinkage to growth at the end of the decade. Conversely, opposite shifts of the same magnitude would accelerate oil demand’s slide into contraction. World oil demand by region (mb/d), 2019-2030 Fundamentals Green shoots emerging, but GDP growth remains below trend The global economy is still in the process of adjusting to 2022’s sea change, when major central banks launched their unprecedented battle against consumer inflation that reached 40-year highs. These measures have to date resulted in a cumulative 4-5% hike in interest rates for advanced economies. Whilst still inconclusive considering monetary policy’s long and variable lags, these campaigns can so far be considered largely successful – inflation has retreated from its 9-10% peak to around 3% in most developed countries. Moreover, the decline has been achieved without driving the global economy into recession, amid notably firm labour markets and resilient consumer spending. However, the final stage of this push has proved challenging, with inflation remaining stubbornly above its target of 2%, by around 1-2%. Until this “last mile” has been completed, the hoped-for soft landing for the global economy, accompanied by a return to monetary easing, may prove elusive. In this context, breakeven inflation rates derived from bond markets price annual US inflation at around 2.4% at a five-year horizon. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth North America 24.9 21.9 23.7 24.3 24.6 24.5 24.6 24.4 24.0 23.7 23.4 23.0 -0.9% -1.6 S&C America 6.7 5.7 6.4 6.7 6.9 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.3 1.0% 0.5 Europe 15.8 13.7 14.5 14.9 14.8 14.7 14.6 14.5 14.4 14.2 14.0 13.8 -1.0% -1.0 Africa 4.2 3.9 4.2 4.3 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.2 2.6% 0.8 Middle East 8.8 8.1 8.4 8.9 9.0 9.0 9.2 9.3 9.3 9.3 9.1 9.0 0.0% 0.0 Eurasia 4.3 4.2 4.5 4.6 4.6 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.7 4.8 4.8 4.9 0.8% 0.3 Asia Pacific 35.9 34.2 35.8 36.3 38.1 39.1 39.8 40.4 41.0 41.5 41.9 42.3 1.5% 4.2 World 100.6 91.7 97.5 100.1 102.2 103.2 104.2 105.0 105.3 105.5 105.6 105.4 0.4% 3.2 Annual change 0.5 -8.9 5.8 2.6 2.1 1.0 1.0 0.7 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.1 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 17 IEA.

A slump in global trade weighs heavily on export-dependent China and the eurozone, with both pivoting towards structurally lower expansion. In this regard, the present shift towards deglobalisation does not augur well, as higher tariffs and other restrictions hamper trade and upend supply chains. Sino-US trade frictions, focused on technology, have become especially visible. In parallel, geopolitical risks have also become more pertinent, amid wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and an increasingly tense relationship between China and some neighbouring countries. Government spending has been rampant since the pandemic, with knock-on effects on borrowing, interest rates and prices. As outlays for programmes such as social security, health care, the green economy and defence balloon, so do fiscal deficits and government debt burdens. The IMF has singled out budget deficits in the United States and China as posing significant financial stability risks for the global economy. Real GDP growth assumptions Source: Oxford Economics. Global GDP growth is projected to average 3% over the 2024-2030 forecast period – about half a point lower than during the 2010s. Emerging economies will remain the main drivers by far, with average 2024-2030 non-OECD GDP growth more than double the OECD rate (4% versus 1.7%). By 2030, the non-OECD share of total global GDP will climb to 59%, from 55% in 2023. GDP expansion in the United States will reach 2.6% in 2024 before subsiding, as higher-for-longer interest rates trickle down into the real economy and excess savings from the pandemic era are finally depleted. Growth will average 1.7% over the remainder of the forecast period. Soaring fiscal deficits (at 7.1% of GDP in 2025, according to the IMF, it is almost three times the 2% average for other advanced economies) will increasingly add to price pressures and act as a drag on economic growth. 2011-2019 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026-30 USA 2.4% 1.9% 2.5% 2.6% 1.9% 1.7% Europe 2.0% 3.2% 1.3% 1.5% 2.0% 1.4% Japan 0.9% 0.9% 1.9% 0.5% 0.9% 0.4% China 7.3% 3.0% 5.2% 4.7% 4.1% 3.7% India 6.8% 6.6% 7.7% 6.3% 7.4% 6.4% Africa 3.7% 3.8% 2.5% 3.0% 3.9% 3.4% OECD 2.1% 3.0% 1.7% 1.6% 1.9% 1.6% Non-OECD 4.7% 3.6% 4.4% 4.1% 4.4% 3.9% World 3.4% 3.3% 3.2% 3.0% 3.3% 2.9% Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 18 IEA.

Germany will be a key engine of the modest recovery as a rebound in manufacturing lifts GDP growth to 1.3% in 2025 after two years of little growth and will remain around that level thereafter. Japan’s GDP will expand by 0.5% on average between 2024 and 2030 – the lowest of any major economy as an ageing population and a shrinking labour force weigh on productivity and depress potential growth. China’s economy continues to battle formidable headwinds such as a shrinking population, a protracted real estate slump now in its third year, industrial overcapacity, heavily indebted local governments and a nascent deflationary spiral amid soft domestic demand. Baseline trend growth will fall below 4% in 2026 and remain there to the end of our forecast period. Whilst reasonably firm in global terms, this is around half of the country’s pre-pandemic trend. India’s GDP growth will remain by far the strongest among major economies, averaging 6.5% over the forecast period due to structural tailwinds such as benign demographics, a burgeoning middle class, and accelerating urbanisation and industrialisation. Oil demand will grow at a relatively fast rate as the energy intensity of the country’s economy picks up from a low base. Scenarios show price impact on oil demand Assumptions about GDP growth and its impact on oil demand are a key component of our demand estimates. The average GDP elasticity of global oil demand is about 0.3 for OECD and 0.6 for non-OECD, reflecting the greater oil-intensity of emerging markets. Additionally, expectations of future oil prices are paramount for demand estimates, with forecasts sensitive to both the absolute price level and sequential price changes over the outlook period. Oil prices used for the modelling are based on an average 2025 Brent crude price of about USD 79/bbl – which is held constant in real terms over the remainder of the forecasting period. In addition to this base case, we have considered alternative high- and low-price scenarios: High-price scenario: Assumes oil prices increase by 2.5% in real terms per annum, in line with their long-term historical pattern. Low-price scenario: Estimates of future spot prices are based on the ICE Brent forward curve (slowing from USD 79/bbl in 2025 to USD 69/bbl in 2030). These prices are then discounted to real terms. Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 19 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The high-price scenario would curtail 2030 global oil demand by 650 kb/d. However, this would not cause demand to peak earlier. Conversely, the low-price scenario would lift oil consumption by 1.1 mb/d at the end of the forecasting period, eliminating the current 2029 peak. Alternative real oil price scenarios and impact on global oil demand, 2024-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Non-OECD price controls limit pass-through of market prices to retail The impact of changes in oil prices on oil demand is roughly similar in OECD and non-OECD economies, despite non-OECD oil consumption being, at least in theory, more sensitive to changes in oil prices. Developing economies tend to be more oil intensive with their output gravitating towards agriculture and heavy industry. Also, energy ranks high in developing country Consumer Price Index (CPI) baskets, with poorer households spending a larger share of their income on basic goods. In theory, this results in higher oil demand price elasticities, as a price increase will be more keenly felt in developing countries. However, these higher theoretical elasticities for lower-income countries are not at all clear in reality. This is because the market price mechanism whereby open market oil prices are converted into retail prices is less straightforward in poorer countries, being heavily mediated by their governments through price controls and subsidies. These controls contribute to retail prices that are, as a rule, much lower in developing countries and closer to global wholesale market levels. In this regard, poorer countries contrast sharply with OECD countries where elevated fuel taxes inflate retail prices. More importantly, the prevalence of price controls in non-OECD economies results in a weak pass-through of market oil prices into pump prices.

Road fuel demand approaching peak EVs to curtail consumption of key fuels Global electric car sales continue to display stellar growth. According to the IEA’s Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2024, sales could reach around 17 million in 2024, increasing from 14 million in 2023, with EVs accounting for nearly one in five cars sold globally. This ascent is set to persist, with total sales projected to reach 40 million in 2030, when almost one in two new cars will be an EV. This will displace around 6 mb/d of road fuels demand by the end of our forecast period. The EV phenomenon remains primarily a Chinese one. In 2023 the majority of EV sales were in China (60%), with Europe (25%) and the United States (10%) accounting for the bulk of sales elsewhere. This dominance is set to continue – almost one in three cars on the roads in China by 2030 is expected to be electric, compared to almost one in five in both the United States and the European Union.

CC BY 4.0. same lines, more than half of all EVs sold globally were produced by Chinese carmakers, compared to only 10% for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. The environment for EVs has become more challenging in Western countries of late amid the partial phasing out of tax breaks and subsidies, with unsold cars piling up at car dealership lots. In contrast to China’s mass-market adoption, EVs remain a comparatively niche product in developed economies, experiencing difficulty broadening their appeal beyond relatively prosperous, environmentally concerned urban motorists. High sticker prices, the lack of an adequate charging infrastructure and collapsing second-hand values act as deterrents to less affluent buyers. At the same time, trade frictions between China and the west are building due to cheap EVs from China rapidly gaining market share, crowding out higher-cost Western carmakers. This has prompted accusations that, backed by disproportionate government aid, China is exporting its structural overcapacity. The May 2024 decision by the Biden Administration to quadruple tariffs on Chinese EVs is a case in point. The European Union was also conducting an anti-dumping investigation into Chinese EVs at the time of writing. Despite these headwinds, we expect EV growth to continue the acceleration of recent years, with oil demand savings advancing as more cars enter the fleet. This increase will be underpinned by ambitious zero-emissions targets, ongoing industrial policy support and steadily falling prices – parity with ICE cars could be attained by 2030 for most models outside of China. Still, it is worth emphasising that our forecast is highly dependent on EV ownership extending beyond early adopters and finding mass-market acceptance in Western economies. While China remains the key driver of growth, sales will become less concentrated both geographically (with emerging market economies such as India more prominent) and in terms of fuels, with diesel gaining in relative importance. EVs are set to avoid an extra annual 1 mb/d of road fuels demand in 2029 and 2030, for a cumulative displacement of 6.1 mb/d, marking a sixfold increase versus 2023. Of this amount, 4.7 mb/d will be in gasoline and 1.4 mb/d in diesel. For the latter fuel, commercial and freight use will account for around 1 mb/d of savings, while in regional terms Europe will be responsible for the lion’s share at 630 kb/d – outstripping the continent’s gasoline savings of 530 kb/d. Efficiency improvements continue to reduce fuel use Efficiency improvements will assume increased importance over the forecast period in all transport segments, including road, maritime and aviation. Total efficiency gains are expected to reduce oil demand growth by 4.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, with the majority of savings in OECD road fuels amid stricter environmental regulations in Europe and the United States. Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 22 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The European Union adopted new vehicle carbon dioxide (CO2) standards in March 2023, requiring a 55% reduction in emissions of new cars by 2030 versus 2021. The new rule released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March 2024 is projected to cut CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles by nearly 50% in 2032 from 2026, to 85 grammes of CO2 per mile. Carmakers have been given a three-year extension to 2030 to reduce tailpipe emissions amid a “technology neutral” approach. Besides fully electric vehicles, compliance can be attained by producing a range of “cleaner” cars, including gas-powered cars, hybrid EVs, and plug-in hybrids. Much of these efficiency gains are being offset by a shift towards larger conventional cars, which will support road fuel demand in the medium term. To a considerable extent, improvements in engine efficiency have enabled more widespread ownership of larger vehicles, as fuel cost savings increase affordability, in line with the Jevons Paradox. In some cases, carmakers also use larger bodies for hybrid vehicles, where additional equipment requires more space. This increase in size may also be visible within the EV segment. As a result of efficiency improvements and EVs crowding out ICE cars, road fuels, especially gasoline, would become more readily available and comparatively lower in cost. Price‑elastic consumers, especially in emerging market countries, would be the main beneficiaries of a rebound effect on demand, partly offsetting direct global fuel savings due to efficiencies and greater EV use. Behavioural pandemic-era mobility transformations persist Four years after the Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented disruptions to everyday life, people’s daily routines have overwhelmingly returned to normal. In parallel, oil demand growth has reverted to its former underlying behavioural drivers, with traditional economic factors replacing public health restrictions. A key exception in this regard is in corporate life, where mobility patterns have been transformed due to a persistent shift to remote and hybrid work. After cratering during H1 2020, office attendance initially rebounded sharply as social distancing measures were relaxed. However, this recovery has stalled since 2022, with remote and hybrid work in developed economies stabilising at permanently higher levels. In 2023, full-time employees in America worked from home (WFH) 1.4 days per week on average according to the Global Survey of Working Arrangements – a fivefold increase versus 2019. In this context, the United States is emblematic of a group of advanced economies, predominantly in the Anglosphere – for example, Canada (1.7 days) and the United Kingdom (1.5 days) – where WFH has effectively become part of the new normal. The custom has advanced less in other developed economies, with an average 0.8 days per week worked remotely in mainland European countries, and Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 23 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 0.7 days in Asia. Also, there are large differences within countries across age groups, incomes and industries. WFH is most common among higher-paid, higher-educated workers and concentrated in knowledge-intensive sectors such as finance and information technology, where work can be more easily performed remotely. These technologically adept employees also tend to be younger. Other factors contribute to the appeal of WFH – US workers tend to have longer and more expensive commutes as well as bigger homes, incentivising remote work. WFH’s future, beyond the stabilisation of recent years, is uncertain. Its impact on productivity is still hotly debated, with some employers tightening their rules and demanding that remote staff return to their desks at least some of the time. A recent slowdown in hiring in finance and tech may strengthen their hand. Conversely, lawmakers in several nations have passed legislation promoting the right to flexible work arrangements or proposed doing so. Also, technological innovation in video conferencing may enhance the quality and prevalence of virtual meetings. In the United States, WFH has accelerated the long-term decoupling between road fuel demand and the size of the economy. Gasoline consumption has been lagging key macroeconomic indicators for decades, as driving mobility gradually moved towards saturation. In 2023, total vehicle miles travelled (VMT) were almost the same as in 2019, although GDP had increased by 8%. Widening the gap further is that fuel demand has also lagged mobility – US gasoline deliveries were 4% lower over this period, as more efficient car engines and an expanding EV fleet curtailed demand.

CC BY 4.0. Partially counteracting WFH’s negative effects on gasoline demand since 2020 was a switch from public transport to car journeys, as health risk-averse travellers avoided public transit and quieter roads in some regions made driving easier. While mass transit ridership rebounded strongly in 2022 and 2023, passenger volumes in most developed economies remain short of 2019 levels. Public transport use has fallen in major US and UK cities due to remote working. According to the Metropolitan Transport Authority, ridership on the New York subway averaged 68% of pre-pandemic traffic in 2023. Data from Transport for London (TfL) paint a similar picture, with bus and metro journeys at 84% of pre-Covid levels by October. Along the same lines, the German Federal Statistical Office reported 8% fewer bus and rail passenger journeys in 2023 than in 2019. The key contrast with this lacklustre recovery has been in China, where mobility made a swift and complete comeback in the immediate aftermath of the country’s reopening. Passenger volumes for rail and urban traffic had returned to pre-Covid level by mid-2023, as had domestic flight activity. Similarly, holiday travel rebounded to around 20% above 2019 levels during 2023’s major festivals. The chief exception in this regard is long-distance car travel, amid a cross-modal shift to rail and air traffic – highway passenger volumes are around half of 2019 levels, according to NBS data. Oil demand displacement by EVs and by teleworking IEA. CC BY 4.0. We see the cumulative impact of post-Covid remote working behavioural changes reflected in a reduction of global road fuels demand of 800 kb/d from 2023 to 2030.

CC BY 4.0. Efficiencies slow jet and marine fuel growth Jet fuel will only surpass 2019 levels by 2027 The pandemic wreaked large-scale devastation on global air travel, rendering jet/kerosene by far the most affected among the major oil products, with demand collapsing by 41% to 4.7 mb/d during 2020. In subsequent years, as lockdown restrictions eased and use rebounded, the fuel became the main driver of oil demand growth, at 1 mb/d each in 2022 and 2023. With the post-pandemic rebound now having run its course, growth is set to recalibrate to a sharply slower 300 kb/d in 2024. This deceleration will continue in 2025-2030, averaging 170 kb/d annually for a cumulative 850 kb/d gain, as increasing passenger demand for air travel is counterbalanced by major strides in aircraft design. As a result, global jet fuel demand will not surpass 2019 levels until 2027. The global recovery to pre-pandemic air travel activity became complete during 2023 by measures such as number of flights, passengers and miles flown. Passenger numbers regained the 2019 level somewhat earlier than flight movements, as airlines flew larger, fuller planes on high-traffic routes. February 2024 marked the first occurrence of a full recovery in both the domestic (+13.7% versus 2019) and international (+0.9% versus 2019) segments, measured in revenue-passenger kilometres (the number of paying passengers multiplied by the total distance travelled), according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) data.

CC BY 4.0. Nonetheless, jet fuel demand has failed to keep pace with air travel, making it the only fuel where consumption has not yet regained pre-pandemic levels. Global jet fuel demand in 2024 is only 95% of 2019 levels, despite a widespread recovery in flight numbers. Among the major economies, China’s rebound to 101% stands out, contrasting with demand lagging elsewhere – 97% in the United States, 96% in OECD Europe and 93% in OECD Asia. Although operational improvements and optimisation in flight planning have contributed to this divergence, the gap arises chiefly due to the advances that have been made in aircraft fuel efficiencies since 2019. Flagship new-generation models such as the Airbus320neo (introduced in 2016) and the Boeing 737 MAX (2017) burn up to 30% less fuel than their predecessors. The replacement of older models in fleets has been swift – thus far, deliveries of the A320neo and MAX families have been 3 279 and 1 486, respectively, with years-long backlogs for planes. Fuel savings have followed and are set to continue, with Airbus progressing towards an upgrade to the current A320neo that would boost fuel efficiency by a further 20% to 25%. These fuel economies will partially counteract solid underlying global growth in demand for air travel. IATA forecasts this to double by 2040, increasing at an annual rate of 3.4% between 2019-2040. Geographically, growth rates range between 2.1% for Europe and the United States to 4.6% in the Asia Pacific region, with the latter making up half of global passenger demand in 2040. Structurally lower GDP growth will constrain demand increases in advanced economies, as will limited capacity at airports and heightened concerns about the climate impact of air travel. As a result, the Asia Pacific region will account for two-thirds of 2023-2030 demand gains, as both higher wealth and disposable incomes drive changes in consumer behaviour, boosting aspirations for perceived luxuries such as tourism and air travel. Slowing trade and IMO efficiencies erode marine fuel growth Demand for marine fuels (comprising marine bunkers and domestic navigation) is expected to hover around 5.3 mb/d throughout the forecast period, as below-par growth in trade and seaborne freight combines with tighter standards imposed by the IMO to reduce the carbon intensity of shipping. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) forecasts maritime trade to expand at an average annual growth rate of 2.1% by 2028 – below the 3% historical average of the past three decades. In addition to below-trend GDP growth, the expansion of tariffs and other restrictions act as a headwind to global trade, as do higher ocean freight rates. At the same time, regulatory targets for shipping carbonisation are accelerating. The 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships updated the Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 27 IEA. CC BY 4.0. initial strategy adopted in 2018 with enhanced net zero targets, calling for a 20% to 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The efficiency standards mandated by the IMO will counterbalance underlying trade growth of around 600 kb/d by 2030, resulting in a flattish demand profile for marine fuels over the forecast horizon. Oil displacement in power generation Oil burn set to plummet as Saudi ambitions come into focus Ambitious plans by Saudi Arabia and Iraq to cut the use of oil in power generation are projected to make a momentous contribution to taming global oil demand growth. Middle Eastern countries are estimated to have used 1.5 mb/d of oil to produce electricity in 2023, about 40% of the global total and one-sixth of overall regional oil consumption. Fuel oil and direct crude burning each accounted for around 600 kb/d. Much of this is concentrated in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, where it plays a crucial role in managing peak summer electricity demand. We estimate that this substitution in power sources, focused on new gas and solar capacity, will reduce the amount of oil used in generation by 1.1 mb/d by 2030. Impact of Middle East substitution of oil use in power generation, 2019-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Saudi Arabia is currently the world’s largest consumer of oil for power generation but has announced plans that would end this dependency by 2030 in favour of natural gas and renewables. The Kingdom’s Liquid Fuel Displacement Program would eliminate approximately 1 mb/d of crude oil, fuel oil and gasoil use through a combination of incremental domestic gas resources, notably from the Jafurah project, and an enormous increase in renewables generation.

CC BY 4.0. plans, we estimate that direct crude burn will be reduced by 500 kb/d from 2023 to 2030, while fuel oil and gasoil use falls by 350 kb/d and 150 kb/d, respectively. The country has set a target of 50% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, with a goal of 130 GW of renewables capacity. Despite substantial growth in other sectors, Saudi Arabia’s total domestic consumption is forecast to fall by 530 kb/d (14%) between 2023 and 2030. Only the United States will see a steeper decline in absolute terms between now and the end of the decade. These two countries, the world’s top oil producers, will post the largest drops in demand. Iraq’s electricity grid has come under strain in recent years. Power plants have struggled to meet surging peak summer demand, even with imports from neighbouring countries. Currently, the country receives both power and gas from other nations, most notably Iran. An agreement where Iraq receive Iranian gas was extended for five years in March 2024, meaning that incremental domestic generation and new imports from other sources can be used to meet the gap with demand and reduce oil burn. The country burns on average approximately 150 kb/d of crude and around 360 kb/d of fuel oil but started curbing crude used in power generation in May. This year Iraq plans to reduce crude oil burn as part of its obligation to offset overproduction of its OPEC+ target in Q1 2024. In March, Iraq submitted a compensation plan to make up its excess output, in which it agreed to cut production by reducing crude oil use in power generation from May-December 2024. Iraq will gradually reduce crude burn over the nine-month period, and will average around 45 kb/d, which will cap its crude burn at 75 kb/d. In the medium term, domestic resources coupled with increased imports of gas and electricity should allow for further replacement of crude and fuel oil used in power generation. With support from the United States, Iraq aims to capture associated gas, which is currently being flared from oil fields, for power generation. Additionally, TotalEnergies is working on projects to develop gas and solar resources within the country. We estimate that these will result in a 120 kb/d reduction in direct crude burn by 2030. These changes would be sufficient to see both Saudi and Iraqi oil demand peak in the middle of this decade, comfortably ahead of the world as a whole. In the process, substantial additional crude volumes would become available for export. These changes also will materially loosen global fuel oil balances at a time when refiners are set to grapple with ever-lighter crude slates. Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 29 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Petrochemicals lead growth Use of feedstock products will expand throughout the decade Rising demand for petrochemical feedstocks will be the largest force for growth in oil demand during the medium-term. Projected 2023-2030 gains of 2.8 mb/d would be equivalent to about three-quarters of the overall increase in oil consumption and will be dominated by ethane (+820 kb/d) and LPG (+730 kb/d) as the industry digests burgeoning global NGL volumes. China will remain far and away the most important region for higher petrochemical activity. In the wake of an unprecedented wave of plant construction, feedstock use is forecast to go up by 1.3 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, having risen by 2.6 mb/d from 2017 to 2023. This surge reflects a drive towards self-reliance in polymers by the world’s largest importer of petrochemical products, boosting both imports and domestic production of ethane, LPG and naphtha. Petrochemical feedstock demand growth, 2019-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. In contrast to other segments of oil demand, overall petrochemical activity continued to expand during the pandemic years as the interruption to demand from manufacturing, textiles and construction was more than offset by increased plastic use in packaging, and medical and protective equipment. Indeed, overall demand for ethylene – the most important petrochemical building-block molecule – may have fallen slightly in 2022 as this exceptional demand subsided. Over the rest of this decade, this remarkably steady growth is set to continue. We expect demand for light olefins (ethylene and propylene) to increase by about 2.8% per year from 2023 to 2030.

CC BY 4.0. and average incomes, especially in emerging markets, as well as the increasing prevalence of online shopping and delivery services, boost packaging demand. In addition, some important manufacturing growth areas, including clean energy technologies like EVs and solar panels, are relatively polymer intensive. Factors like these mean that plastic consumption rises most sharply as an economy enters middle-income status and, as with overall oil use, gains in polymer end-use will be highly concentrated in non-OECD nations. While the global rate of growth in petrochemical activity has been relatively stable over recent years, this disguises major shifts in where the production, and associated feedstock consumption, is taking place. These changes result from patterns of investment and feedstock availability. Chinese and US petrochemical market shares expanding A major shift in activity took place over the pandemic years, with China rapidly cementing its role as the world’s foremost centre of polymer production. This has had major implications for oil demand, with combined naphtha, LPG and ethane increasing by 1.7 mb/d from 2019 to 2023. Over the same period, total oil demand went up by the same amount globally. Light olefins capacity additions, 2019-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Between 2019 and the end of 2024 Chinese producers will have completed construction of ethylene and propylene producing plants roughly equivalent to the combined existing capacity in Europe, Japan and Korea. We expect them to add half as much again before the end of the decade. These new facilities are overwhelmingly a combination of world-scale naphtha crackers closely integrated to new refineries as well as LPG/ethane crackers and propane dehydrogenation -5 0 5 10 15 20 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Mt/y By region OECD Americas Other OECD China Middle East Other regions Total -5 0 5 10 15 20 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Mt/y By technology Steam crackers PDH Total Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 31 IEA. CC BY 4.0. (PDH) plants designed to process imported feedstocks. Alongside major investments underway elsewhere, especially the Middle East, this means that global petrochemical markets are set to remain fiercely competitive. In addition to having the world’s largest petrochemical industry, China remains the world’s largest importer of petrochemical commodities. Average 2023 shipments of polymers, synthetic fibres and intermediates were equivalent to about 2.1 mb/d of overseas feedstock use (roughly equal to total German oil demand). Combined with an estimated 4.6 mb/d of local feedstock intake, a total of 6.5% of global 2023 oil consumption went to supply China with petrochemical commodities. This quantity is larger than the national oil demand for all but two countries, the United States and China. Growth of 1.3 mb/d between 2019 and 2023 in Chinese consumption of petrochemicals, correcting for import substitution, accounted for 81% of global oil demand gains. This import substitution has been a major focus of Chinese investments, with global 2023 shipments of ethylene and its derivatives to the country tumbling by 23% compared to average 2019-2020 levels, according to an analysis of ICIS trade data. Imports of paraxylene, the most important aromatic building-block molecule, have collapsed by almost 40%. Overall, we estimate that increased Chinese production has displaced more than 700 kb/d of feedstock demand in the rest of the world, so that more than one-third of the rise in Chinese feedstock requirements has been at the expense of oil consumption in other regions. China and United States ethylene derivatives trade, 2017-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from ICIS. US output of petrochemicals has also risen dramatically as a result of burgeoning domestic NGL supply and investments in capacity to utilise the resulting low-cost ethane on a large scale.

Total US exports of ethylene derivatives have increased by 33% since 2019, according to ICIS data. These volumes would require 300 kb/d of ethane to produce. Further growth will be comparatively limited to 2030, with the start-up of only one more world-scale ethane cracker expected, in 2027 or 2028. Nonetheless, ample domestic availability should enable a gradual increase in US operating rates and polymer exports for 2023-2030 feedstock demand growth of 310 kb/d. Naphtha crackers and traditional exporters under pressure Consecutive waves of capacity additions in China and the United States have left producers in other regions facing significant pressure amid an oversupplied market. The sharpest fall in operating rates has been seen in OECD Europe, where naphtha demand fell by 240 kb/d (22%) between 2021 and 2023. Petrochemicals Europe data shows steam cracker operating rates falling to 66% in 2023, compared to 81% in 2021 and 90% in 2016. European imports of ethylene derivatives increased sharply ahead of and during the pandemic years. North America was responsible for almost all of these new shipments, incremental regional flows that would require the consumption of 180 kb/d of naphtha. European petrochemical trade, 2017-2030 and operations, 2014-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from ICIS, Petrochemicals Europe. Operating levels in Asia, excluding China, have also suffered. OECD Asia naphtha consumption, which takes place almost exclusively in Korea and Japan, fell by 7.9% (160 kb/d) between 2021 and 2023. We estimate that naphtha use in the rest of Asia declined by 16% (210 kb/d), with drops concentrated in Chinese Taipei and Thailand.

CC BY 4.0. likely suffered significantly. As with Europe, we have assumed that there will not be a sharp rebound in activity during the medium-term, owing to continued competitive pressures. At first glance, the fact that Asian feedstock demand fell by less than in Europe is a little surprising. Asian petrochemical operations are much more directly exposed to Chinese competition than their peers elsewhere and operate on a similar cost base to Europe. Multiple factors have likely contributed to this comparative resilience. Typically, plants in the region are newer and better integrated to refineries and downstream consumption – especially in Korea, which accounted for 40% of 2023 Asian naphtha demand (excluding China). Notably, European capacities are often operated by companies with global portfolios of plants. In an oversupplied global market, this may result in these producers deciding to supply European customers by bringing in additional material from lower cost regions like North America. Middle Eastern producers, especially in Saudi Arabia and Iran, also appear to have lost substantial market share over recent years. While regional producers should be highly cost-competitive, a decline in operating rates may reflect limitations on feedstock availability amid upstream production cuts and a strong focus on export markets in general, and China in particular. Saudi 2023 exports of ethylene derivatives fell by 21% compared with 2019, according to ICIS data. Although partially offset by rising domestic demand, this would be equivalent to a combined loss of 230 kb/d in LPG and ethane use. In Iran, which is extremely dependent on China as a polymer export destination, ethylene exports fell by 35%, or the equivalent of 70 kb/d of LPG/ethane demand over the same period.

An expected 270 kb/d of ethane will come from Saudi Aramco’s NGL-rich Jafurah project. Along with a similar volume of LPG, this would be sufficient to reinforce operating rates at existing facilities and supply new steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) units, while making additional LPG volumes available for export. Other new plants in the UAE, Qatar and Oman will also add to regional demand for naphtha, LPG and ethane consumption for an overall increase in 2030 feedstock use of 520 kb/d compared with 2023. Chinese capacity and US NGLs reshaping global markets Chinese petrochemical feedstocks have provided the single most important contribution to world oil demand growth in recent years, dovetailing neatly with one of the largest driver of incremental global supply: US NGLs. Together these countries have formed a mutually reinforcing symbiosis, with the wave of cheap propane and ethane exports from the United States finding an indispensable outlet and keeping input costs for Chinese importers low. This has transformed oil and petrochemical market dynamics. US NGLs supplying Chinese petrochemical demand growth, 2019-2023 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from Kpler, ICIS. Between 2019 and 2023, US exports of ethane and LPG increased by 940 kb/d, according to Kpler data. A large majority of these incremental volumes went to China, where US shipments rose from close to zero, to around 700 kb/d. Total Chinese imports of these products increased by only 570 kb/d over the period. During this period, the United States has also been the only major producer to boost its polymer exports into China, according to ICIS data.

This is just over half of global demand growth across all oil products over the same period. Alongside this regional interdependence, a similar relationship exists between ethane crackers, which produce ethylene, and PDH units, which produce propylene from propane. Together, these can replace the two most important outputs of naphtha crackers, which produce significant amounts of both major light olefins. In the past, the impact of increases in ethane cracker capacity on naphtha cracking was limited by their lack of propylene production. New ethane-consuming units put pressure on naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia, reducing their output. This tightens propylene markets, with relative prices rising, supporting naphtha cracker economics. However, the wave of new PDH capacity over recent years appears to have changed this. Chinese producers alone have more than doubled global PDH capacity between 2019 and 2024. Thanks to ample propane availability, propylene supply from these plants has been able to rise in tandem with ethane-cracker ethylene output, especially in the United States. This one-two punch has substantially weakened the position of naphtha crackers and paved the way for a fall in operating rates on the scale seen in Europe since 2021. Demand developments by region North American, European oil demand contracts Oil demand in North America is forecast to average 24.6 mb/d in 2024-2025, before gradually declining to 23 mb/d in 2030. Oil consumption in the region will not regain its 2019 level of 24.9 mb/d. Among the constituent countries, only the United States will, briefly, recover to pre-pandemic levels, unlike Canada and Mexico. The United States, representing more than 80% of the region’s consumption, is already seeing demand plateau near its current level of 20.4 mb/d, peaking in 2025 and ending the forecasting period at 18.9 mb/d.

Gasoil – the continent’s main fuel by far, accounting for almost half of the product mix – will be responsible for most of the decrease, continuing the decline that started in 2022. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 3.5 3.6 3.8 3.9 4.1 4.3 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.6 1.8% 0.5 Naphtha 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.2% 0.0 Gasoline 11.0 9.4 10.2 10.4 10.5 10.3 10.3 10.0 9.7 9.4 9.0 8.6 -2.8% -1.9 Jet/Kerosene 2.0 1.2 1.5 1.8 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.1 2.1 1.3% 0.2 Gasoil/Diesel 5.1 4.6 4.9 5.1 5.1 4.9 5.0 5.0 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.7 -1.1% -0.4 Residual fuel oil 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 -1.1% 0.0 Other products 2.5 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 0.2% 0.0 Total products 24.9 21.9 23.7 24.3 24.6 24.5 24.6 24.4 24.0 23.7 23.4 23.0 -0.9% -1.6 Annual change -0.2 -3.1 1.8 0.7 0.2 0.0 0.0 -0.2 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.4 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 mb/d North America -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 Europe Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 37 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Europe oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 Consumption is weighed down by the eurozone’s lacklustre manufacturing climate, as well as by displacement in home heating and, especially, road transport amid Europe’s ongoing migration from diesel to gasoline-engine cars. This shift will, temporarily, keep gasoline demand growth in positive territory, counterbalancing headwinds of expanding EV fleets and vehicle efficiencies. Still, the combined share of new gasoline (35.3%) and diesel (13.6%) sales constituted less than half of the passenger market in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. While both powertrains have falling market shares, the contraction for gasoline cars of 1.1% contrasts with a diesel decline of 2.8%. Gasoline use will conclude the forecast period at 2.1 mb/d, about 300 kb/d below the high set in 2024. Annual growth of around 1% in LPG/ethane and jet/kerosene growth during 2023-2030 will be unable to counterbalance the structural decline in road fuels, and aggregate demand in 2030 of 13.8 mb/d will be a full 2 mb/d lower than in 2019. Asia Pacific propels global demand growth Oil demand in Asia Pacific, which includes OECD Asia Oceania and represents around 40% of global oil use, will rise by 4.2 mb/d during 2023-2030. This surpasses the net 3.2 mb/d in global gains, as consumption contracts in advanced economies. Robust economic growth in Asia, topping 4% per annum over the forecast period, is buoyed by structural factors such as population growth and industrialisation, as well as a growing middle class that is more likely to spend on energy intensive luxury goods such as cars and travel. Growth is fairly evenly balanced across the product mix, with LPG/ethane, naphtha, jet/kerosene and gasoil each contributing around 1 mb/d. This leaves gasoline as the main outlier, with regional demand largely unchanged over the forecast period, weighed down by substantial Chinese EV savings. In parallel, growth will be more geographically balanced, with other Asian countries such as Viet Nam, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia more prominent as China’s dominance during the Covid era fades. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.1% 0.1 Naphtha 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.9 -0.7% 0.0 Gasoline 2.3 2.0 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.3 2.3 2.2 2.1 -1.8% -0.3 Jet/Kerosene 1.6 0.8 0.9 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.6 1.1% 0.1 Gasoil/Diesel 7.1 6.5 6.8 6.9 6.6 6.4 6.3 6.2 6.1 6.0 5.8 5.7 -2.2% -1.0 Residual fuel oil 1.0 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.3% 0.0 Other products 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 0.5% 0.0 Total products 15.8 13.7 14.5 14.9 14.8 14.7 14.6 14.5 14.4 14.2 14.0 13.8 -1.0% -1.0 Annual change 0.0 -2.0 0.8 0.4 -0.1 -0.2 -0.1 -0.1 -0.2 -0.2 -0.2 -0.2 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 38 IEA.

Asia Pacific oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 China oil demand heading for plateau Demand in China, long the single most important driver of global growth in oil use, is set to reach a plateau at close to 18 mb/d (1.4 mb/d higher than 2023) by the end of the decade. While our projections do not show a peak before 2030, the annual increase would be 100 kb/d or less, well within the margin of error, after 2027. Chinese demand will grow by 850 kb/d (2.5% per year) from 2023 to 2025 before slowing, with a gain of 570 kb/d (0.6% per year) during the final five years of our forecast. China oil demand and economic growth, 2014-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from Oxford Economics. China also displays major divergences in demand patterns. The expansion of its petrochemical industry will continue to lead the world, albeit less explosively than over the past five years, while demand for major transport fuels shows more limited scope for growth. Gasoline demand may even tip into decline from 2025 amid rampant, mass-market electrification. Together, battery EVs and plug-in hybrids were approaching 50% of domestic sales by May 2024, and up by more than a third for the first five months of the year, according to China Passenger Car Association data. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 4.4 4.4 4.6 4.9 5.2 5.5 5.7 5.9 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 2.7% 1.1 Naphtha 4.6 4.5 4.9 4.9 5.3 5.5 5.7 5.9 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 2.6% 1.1 Gasoline 7.6 7.1 7.6 7.5 7.9 8.1 8.0 8.1 8.0 8.0 7.9 7.8 -0.1% -0.1 Jet/Kerosene 2.9 1.9 1.8 1.9 2.5 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 4.2% 0.8 Gasoil/Diesel 9.2 8.6 9.0 9.3 9.7 9.9 10.1 10.3 10.4 10.6 10.7 10.8 1.5% 1.1 Residual fuel oil 2.4 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.8 0.6% 0.1 Other products 4.9 5.3 5.3 5.2 4.9 4.6 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.8 4.9 5.0 0.2% 0.1 Total products 35.9 34.2 35.8 36.3 38.1 39.1 39.8 40.4 41.0 41.5 41.9 42.3 1.5% 4.2 Annual change 0.4 -1.8 1.6 0.5 1.8 1.0 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.4 0.5 0.3 - 600 - 400 - 200 0 200 400 600 800 kb/d Demand growth by product, 2023-2030 100 125 150 175 200 225 2014 = 100 GDP and oil demand GDP Oil demand Non-petrochemical oil demand Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 39 IEA. CC BY 4.0. China oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 Petrochemical demand remains the lynchpin of Chinese oil demand, drawing in burgeoning imports of LPG/ethane, especially from the United States, and utilisation of naphtha and other liquid feedstocks a key focus of highly integrated, world-scale refining/petrochemical operations. These strategic investments are more than meeting strong growth in domestic polymer and synthetic fibre consumption, allowing large-scale import substitution. We expect total feedstock demand to rise by 1.3 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, at 570 kb/d for LPG/ethane and 780 kb/d for liquids. This means that 95% of net national growth in oil demand, and 42% of the net global rise, will take place in China’s chemical plants. The development of EV supply chains represents another example of strategic investments reshaping domestic and international oil demand. Chinese EVs, which can compete with ICE vehicles on price, have steadily gained consumer acceptance and market penetration. They are set to eliminate 1.6 mb/d of growth in road fuels by 2030 and vehicle exports will help to reduce demand in the rest of the world. Chinese gasoline demand is likely to peak in 2024 or 2025. Battery-powered trucks play a small but growing role in China, at about 3% of sales in 2023. Electrification of trucks and vans will contribute about 300 kb/d of the overall reduction. We estimate that the increased use of freight vehicles fuelled by liquified or compressed natural gas will reduce diesel demand by an additional 100 kb/d. In addition, very large investments in high-speed rail (HSR) over the past decade have changed long-distance mobility patterns, with highway traffic subdued and containing the still strong growth in domestic air traffic. Rail passenger kilometres (pkm) increased by an average of 5.5% in the five years before 2020 and subsequently recovered beyond this level, while highway travel declined. Had this growth in railway use not happened, an estimated 300 kb/d of additional oil would have been needed, assuming the growth in travel was split between road and air. This is comparable to the 450 kb/d of road fuel displaced by EVs in 2023. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 1.8 1.8 1.9 2.2 2.5 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.2 3.5% 0.7 Naphtha 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.8 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.0 3.1 3.9% 0.7 Gasoline 3.4 3.2 3.5 3.2 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.0 -2.1% -0.5 Jet/Kerosene 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.5 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.1 1.2 5.2% 0.3 Gasoil/Diesel 3.2 3.0 3.2 3.3 3.6 3.7 3.9 3.9 3.9 3.9 3.9 3.8 0.7% 0.2 Residual fuel oil 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6% 0.0 Other products 3.0 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.2 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.1 3.1 3.1 3.2 -0.2% -0.1 Total products 14.1 14.3 15.1 15.1 16.6 17.1 17.5 17.7 17.9 18.0 18.1 18.1 1.2% 1.4 Annual change 0.5 0.1 0.8 0.0 1.5 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.0 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 40 IEA.

Forecast demand, excluding petrochemical feedstocks, is already embarking on a long plateau with a high point in 2027 or 2028. This consumption is expected to be about 12 mb/d in both 2024 and 2029 and we estimate that it will not exceed 12.5 mb/d. Although the country’s population is set to fall by 1% during the forecast period, this long plateau sharply diverges from steady GDP growth of almost 4% per year. In this respect, China epitomises the decoupling of GDP growth and oil demand which is a major feature of our global outlook. India leads world in fuel demand growth India’s demand is forecast to grow by more than any country other than China between 2023 and 2030. Unusually, in a global context, an increase of more than 1.3 mb/d will be dominated by rising demand for road transport fuels, with a comparatively small role for petrochemical feedstocks and underlying growth comfortably outpacing deployment of clean energy technologies. In the second half of this decade, India will become by far the most important contributor to overall growth. Gains of 900 kb/d between 2025 and 2030 will be well ahead of China’s 570 kb/d and three-quarters of net global gains over the final five years of our forecast. 0 5 10 15 20 25 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 mb/d HSR fuel displacement Natural gas road freight EV diesel EV gasoline Petrochemical LPG/ethane Petrochemical naphtha/liquids Other uses Diesel Gasoline Total demand Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 41 IEA. CC BY 4.0. India growth in oil demand by product, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. India is set to be the world’s fastest growing major economy for the third year running in 2024. Manufacturing and industrial activity has been especially strong and a massive domestic consumer market, labour force and supportive demographics should see this continue. The nation’s population, which recently overtook China’s to become the world’s largest, is projected to increase by 6% during our forecast period, and higher average incomes will further support mobility demand. Road diesel, the most used product in India and closely linked to industry and commerce, will account for 520 kb/d of 2023-2030 growth (38% of the total). Similarly, gasoline will register a rise of 270 kb/d (20% of the total) as car ownership becomes more widespread. This is far more than in any other country in our projections. Compared with 2000, there was an eightfold increase in the number of cars on the road by 2023. Nevertheless, the fact that last year China had almost seven times as many cars as India highlights the potential for further growth. Our projections assume a roughly 40% increase in the size of the car fleet by 2030. Two- and three-wheelers, which make up about three-quarters of the total vehicle count in India today, will remain very important, especially in urban transportation and last-mile delivery of goods over the forecast period. With lower growth potential compared with passenger cars and a comparatively high potential for electrification, this segment will act as a slight drag on gasoline growth. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 LPG/ethane Naphtha Gasoline Jet/kerosene Gasoil/diesel Fuel oil Other products kb/d Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 42 IEA.

Owing to relatively limited construction of new facilities, Indian will see a lower share of growth come from petrochemicals. Feedstock requirements are set to climb by around 140 kb/d between 2023 and 2030, with an emphasis on naphtha use (+100 kb/d). LPG and ethane use in petrochemical production will rise by a more limited 40 kb/d. This means that overall LPG/ethane growth of 180 kb/d will be dominated by growth in other areas, especially domestic cooking and heating use. The Indian government has promoted the use of LPG as a clean fuel for cooking for several years, launching the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme in 2016. Between 2015 and 2023, LPG/ethane demand, excluding estimated petrochemical use, grew by 160 kb/d. We expect further growth of 140 kb/d by 2030 as access to and uptake of the fuel continues to expand.

Africa leads other emerging markets growth Africa will register demand increases of around 2% per year for all key products, aided by robust GDP growth of 3.4% between 2023 and 2030 – only slightly below the continent’s pre-pandemic trend. Robust population growth (of 17% between 2023 and 2030, to 1.32 billion) will be a key driver in this regard, but also poses challenges to governments to feed their citizens. Moreover, financial and political instability remains a constant risk to Africa’s economic outlook. Multiple countries have experienced chronic sovereign debt crises of late, amid soaring inflation and collapsing currencies – with Egypt, Nigeria and Ghana the most recent cases. Gasoline and diesel, together accounting for two-thirds of the product mix, will be the main drivers of growth, each climbing by around 2% annually. Jet/kerosene demand, increasing by an annual 1.7%, will average a relatively meagre 240 kb/d during 2024-2030, as air travel remains out of reach for the great majority of Africans. LPG will lead relative gains of nearly 5% per year (230 kb/d), almost entirely due to the greater access to clean cooking. Africa oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 Central and South America will experience stable but lacklustre growth of around 70 kb/d, or 1% annually during 2023-2030, in line with equally subdued GDP expansion of 2.2% over the forecast period. GDP growth lags other major emerging regions such as Africa by a full point. The continent’s economic outlook is depressed by above-par inflation and unemployment, low productivity, poor infrastructure and limited participation in global trade. Argentina and Brazil, together responsible for nearly 60% of the region’s oil demand, face distinct challenges. Argentina, struggling to emerge from decades of economic mismanagement and political instability, will see oil demand growth turn positive in 2025 after three straight years of contraction, and thereafter rise by around 10 kb/d. This pace is similar to Brazil’s – the country remains highly dependent on agribusiness (and, indirectly, climate and weather), its non-farming economy plagued by low productivity and a lack of international competitiveness. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 4.8% 0.2 Naphtha 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.4% 0.0 Gasoline 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 2.0% 0.2 Jet/Kerosene 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 1.7% 0.0 Gasoil/Diesel 1.7 1.5 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.5% 0.3 Residual fuel oil 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 2.0% 0.1 Other products 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 1.6% 0.0 Total products 4.2 3.9 4.2 4.3 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.2 2.6% 0.8 Annual change 0.0 -0.3 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 44 IEA.

Russia will not partake in this increase – the country’s oil demand will be flat from 2023 to 2030 at 3.8 mb/d, as international sanctions weigh on trade, with subpar average GDP growth of around 1% annually. Middle East oil demand by product (mb/d), 2019-2030 Middle Eastern oil demand is expected to stay essentially flat between 2024 and 2030 at 9 mb/d, but with a significant shift within the product mix. Greater use of natural gas, which is accompanied by rising NGL availability, particularly in Saudi Arabia, will curtail oil use in power generation but boost demand for petrochemical feedstocks, as the latter emerges as the main driver of growth, increasing by 600 kb/d from 2024 to 2030. These gains will be complemented by an aggregate increase in gasoline, gasoil and jet/kerosene of around 300 kb/d, or around 10% cumulatively. This pace is comparable to the region’s robust population growth – set to increase by the same percentage between 2023 and 2030 to exceed 300 million people. However, these gains will be counterbalanced by lower use of fuel oil and direct crude burn in power generation amid substitution towards natural gas and renewables. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.9% 0.0 Naphtha 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2% 0.0 Gasoline 2.0 1.7 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 0.9% 0.1 Jet/Kerosene 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 1.7% 0.0 Gasoil/Diesel 2.3 2.1 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.6 0.9% 0.2 Residual fuel oil 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 1.4% 0.1 Other products 0.7 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.9% 0.0 Total products 6.7 5.7 6.4 6.7 6.9 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.3 1.0% 0.5 Annual change 0.0 -0.9 0.7 0.3 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Growth Rate 2023-30 Growth LPG/Ethane 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.3 3.3% 0.5 Naphtha 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 3.6% 0.1 Gasoline 1.8 1.5 1.7 1.8 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.2% 0.3 Jet/Kerosene 0.5 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 3.0% 0.1 Gasoil/Diesel 1.7 1.6 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7 1.7 -0.1% 0.0 Residual fuel oil 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.1 -4.0% -0.4 Other products 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.6 -9.4% -0.6 Total products 8.8 8.1 8.4 8.9 9.0 9.0 9.2 9.3 9.3 9.3 9.1 9.0 0.0% 0.0 Annual change 0.1 -0.7 0.3 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.1 -0.2 Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 45 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chinese refined product reporting may overstate fuel growth Changes in Chinese oil market data reporting in recent years mean that apparent growth in fuel demand since the pandemic is likely overstated. While output of major fuels was seemingly under-reported between 2017 and 2022, data over the last two years appear much more accurate and complete. Changes to our historical product-level demand will await systematic revisions to annual data, but it is possible to make illustrative estimates of the impact of these changes. The distortions can be seen more clearly in the level of implied other products demand in China, which we estimate based on refinery outputs of major products and total refinery runs. This has fluctuated considerably over the past decade. Between 2017 and 2022, other products demand increased by 50%, from 2.3 mb/d to 3.6 mb/d, while overall demand increased by a comparatively smaller 20%. During 2023, implied other products consumption dropped sharply, before stabilising, and the 2024 level is set to be just below 3 mb/d, 16% lower than in 2022. The large implied changes to other product output and demand changes seem to have been the result of under-reported output of the two major fuels during this period. In particular, apparent gasoil demand tumbled by almost 10% from 2018 to 2019 despite a growing economy. Estimated gasoline consumption also remained subdued, compared to a growing ICE vehicle fleet. Reported output of these products, particularly gasoil, rose sharply in H2 2022, despite stringent anti-Covid lockdowns, amid efforts from Beijing to improve data quality and a reported crackdown on tax evasion by refiners. To illustrate the scale of the distortion to Chinese and global demand growth we have made a simple reallocation of this ‘excess’ other products demand to gasoline and gasoil. Based on the premise that reporting was relatively complete in each of 2017 and in 2024, assuming steady growth in other products in the intervening years, would imply large additional volumes allocated to fuels without changing overall demand. This would also result in a much more even development in gasoline and gasoil demand during the pandemic years. On this basis, gasoline usage likely peaked in 2021 and would decline slightly between 2023 and 2024, while 2023 would be the peak year for gasoil consumption. This trajectory fits much better with known government restrictions and bottom-up modelling of vehicle and industrial activity. In particular, developments in recent years are much more in line with the rapid deployment of clean energy technologies like EVs. Oil 2024 Demand PAGE | 46 IEA. CC BY 4.0. China’s other products, combined gasoil and gasoline demand, 2017-2030 These changes are large enough to have global implications. Notably, the stronger than expected growth of gasoline in 2023 and 2024 would be blunted and global gasoil demand may well have peaked in 2022 with declines in both 2023 and 2024. Although demand for both fuels narrowly surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 2023, gasoline appears much closer to its turning point than might otherwise be supposed and gasoil may already been in decline.

Supply Global summary Oil production capacity far outpaces demand, boosting spare supply to record highs World oil production capacity, led higher by the United States and other producers in the Americas, is forecast to outstrip demand growth over the 2023-2030 forecast and, barring the Covid pandemic period, inflate the world’s spare capacity cushion to unprecedented levels. Total supply capacity rises by 6 mb/d to 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a staggering 8 mb/d above projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d. Around 45% of the supply capacity increase over the forecast period comes from NGLs and condensates, mirroring the shift in demand to petrochemicals as the foundation of global growth. Saudi Arabia and the United States will account for two-thirds of the net 2.7 mb/d NGLs and condensates increase from 2023 to 2030. By contrast, crude oil production capacity will expand more moderately relative to historical trends, with non-OPEC+ producers providing more than 80% of the gains.

Assumes Iran and Russia remain under sanctions. Implied oil stock builds include total oil. . Such a massive oil production buffer could usher in a lower oil price environment, posing tough challenges for producers in the US shale patch and the OPEC+ bloc. Given shale’s short-cycle time frame and price reactivity, some output could be at risk (see Shale price sensitivity scenarios). Moreover, reduced requirements for OPEC+ crude may put the alliance’s market management to the test. The huge amount of excess supply could also tempt some in the group to rationalise capacity plans. Saudi Arabia has already taken the lead, announcing in early 2024 a suspension of its 1 mb/d crude capacity expansion. At the same time, it is ramping up gas liquids, reflecting the expanding role of gas in Riyadh’s efforts to transition towards its net zero ambitions. Producers outside the OPEC+ bloc (non-OPEC+) dominate medium-term capacity expansion plans, adding a total of 4.6 mb/d, or 76%, of the net increase. The United States alone accounts for 2.1 mb/d of the non-OPEC+ gains, while Brazil, Guyana, Canada and Argentina contribute a further 2.7 mb/d. As sanctioned expansions ease markedly towards the end of our forecast, growth will stall in the United States and Canada while Brazil and Guyana shift into decline based on current plans. However, should companies continue to sanction additional projects that are already on the drawing board, an incremental 1.3 mb/d of non-OPEC+ capacity could become operational by 2030. 0 2 4 6 8 10 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Implied oil stock build Off mkt due to sanctions Other OPEC+ Iraq UAE Saudi Arabia Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 49 IEA.

The UAE and Iraq are raising crude oil capacity while Saudi Arabia is poised for a significant increase in its output of NGLs and condensates. Capacity in Russia, despite international sanctions, is expected to show only a marginal decline as Moscow opens the taps at its giant Vostok project, helping to offset losses at mature oil fields. Global upstream capital expenditures rose to USD 538 billion in 2023, the highest level since 2015. However, in real terms, spending was still lower than in 2019 due to capital discipline and oilfield services inflation. Based on 2024 guidance, spending is expected to expand by 7% y-o-y – a slower annual increase than the average 14% in the last three years, signalling the post-Covid bounce has ended, and roughly aligned with the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). World producers to pump more than enough to keep market in balance Global oil supply to the market, as opposed to capacity, is estimated at 106.4 mb/d by 2030. This represents a net increase of 4.2 mb/d from 2023 versus growth in demand of 3.2 mb/d over the same period. Non-OPEC+ producers in the Americas dominate the outlook, contributing 4.4 mb/d by the end of the forecast. Anticipated robust non-OPEC+ production throughout most of the forecast period, combined with a marked slowdown in demand, is expected to reduce the call on OPEC+ crude oil by 1.3 mb/d on average annually compared with 2024.

From 2025-2029, annual supply gains average 550 kb/d. After 2029, world oil supply is forecast to swing into contraction in line with a deceleration in oil demand growth due to, amongst other factors, the continued uptake of EVs and intensified efforts to substitute oil use in Middle East power generation. The United States and Canada break fresh annual records throughout the seven-year period. Qatar reaches its highest ever oil output in 2027 and then climbs further on the back of its LNG expansion.

Investment and exploration Capex continues to grow in the Americas, Middle East Global upstream capital expenditure (capex) rose to USD 538 billion in 2023, the highest level since 2015 but still below 2019 levels in real terms. It was the first time in nine years that investment did not move in sync with oil prices, as benchmark crude prices declined y-o-y. Based on 2024 guidance, spending is expected to expand by 7% y-o-y – a slower annual increase than the average of 14% in the last three years, in nominal terms. The increase in upstream investment last year was concentrated in projects executed by national oil companies (NOCs) in the Middle East, China and the Americas. Middle Eastern NOCs increased spending by 16% y-o-y in 2023, to twice the levels seen 10 years ago. Saudi Aramco cancelled plans to boost its crude production capacity by 1 mb/d to 13 mb/d, reducing its total capex by USD 40 billion over the 2024-2028 period. However, the Kingdom intends to focus more on natural gas and invest between USD 48 billion and USD 58 billion this year, higher than last year’s outlay of USD 49.7 billion.

In Asia, China has been accelerating investment in exploration and development under a Seven-Year Action Plan that started in 2019. China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) raised upstream spending in 2023 by 33% to CNY137 billion (Yuan renminbi), equivalent to USD 19.4 billion, helping to boost oil and gas output by 9% y-o-y. This year, the company is targeting a further 5% increase in production with a similar capex budget. PetroChina spent 12% more, or CNY 248 billion (USD 35.1 billion), in oil, gas and new energy in 2023, but is planning to cut investments in these segments by a combined 14% this year. By contrast, Sinopec’s capex shrunk 6% y-o-y for exploration and production in 2023 to CNY 79 billion (USD 11.1 billion) and is targeting marginally lower spend this year. It plans to cut oil production, mainly abroad, while expanding domestic gas production and refinery throughput. Major oil companies and US independent E&Ps overspent compared to the mid- point of their guidance range in 2023. For the most part, 2024 guidance is similar to last year’s actual spending as the majors focus on promising projects in the Americas and independents continue to develop shale resources. ExxonMobil's total capex was above the target range partly due to accelerated drilling programmes in the Permian Basin and Guyana. Chevron will continue to invest USD 5 billion in the Permian and more than USD 2 billion in the US Gulf of Mexico (GoM), including its Anchor project, which is expected to start up this year. A successful acquisition of Hess could increase Chevron's total annual investment by USD 5-6 billion. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024E USD billions Actual Guidance Real (USD 2023) Brent Price (rhs) USD/bbl Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 53 IEA.

Major companies include BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies. US independent companies include 17 selected companies. European majors meanwhile have raised their oil production targets. BP revised its 2030 oil and gas output reduction target from 40% to 25% compared with 2019 levels, excluding production from Rosneft. This resulted in an upwards adjustment to its oil and gas investment of USD 8 billion by 2030, already seen in increased spending for new developments in the United Kingdom and GoM. Shell’s new CEO scrapped its plan to reduce oil production by 20% by 2030. In addition, it is aiming to grow its integrated gas business to maintain its rank as the world’s largest LNG player. While increasing investments in clean energy technologies, TotalEnergies remains committed to oil and gas. Key upstream projects include the second phase of the Mero project in Brazil and frontier developments in Suriname and Namibia. However, net investment was within its stated target range due to its divestment of Canadian assets. Meanwhile, hydrocarbon output for the majors decreased for the fourth year in a row in 2023, led by European companies. This was not only because of their withdrawal from Russian operations but also due to strategy differences with their American counterparts. Among the four European companies, only Eni managed to stymie continuous production losses. However, in its 2024-2027 plan Eni decided to divest some upstream projects and revised its capex from EUR 6-6.5 billion to EUR 5 billion while production targets were kept at a 3-4% compound average growth rate. By contrast, ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips continued to increase output thanks to booming US production. Additionally, 2023 was a busy year for mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

In May 2024, ExxonMobil completed the purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources for USD 59.5 billion, and Chevron announced it had reached an agreement to buy Hess for USD 53 billion, although the deal was in arbitration at the time of publishing. This year, APA Corporation completed an acquisition of Callon Petroleum. In February, Diamondback Energy announced a merger with Endeavor Energy Resources, valuing that latter business at USD 26 billion. Most recently, ConocoPhillips announced their intent to acquire Marathon Oil Corporation at USD 22.5 billion. 2024 capex could be lower than the original guidance before these mergers, but it is expected that the synergies will increase capital efficiency. Outside of the shale patch, ExxonMobil sold its stake in Iraq’s West Qurna-1 project to state-run Basrah Oil Co and Indonesia's Pertamina. ExxonMobil also divested its share in the Ursa Princess in the GoM, while Chevron transferred some of its GoM exploration portfolio to Woodside. TotalEnergies sold TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd to Suncor in November 2023, completing its withdrawal from the Canadian oil sands business. At the same time, the company announced the acquisition of additional interests in Angola and Namibia.

As a result, the average liquids reserves-to-production ratio (R/P) for the majors decreased further, dipping below 10 years. Only ConocoPhillips increased its R/P ratio in 2023. The divestment of Russian assets had a particularly steep impact on BP whose reserves shrunk to less than half of 2022 levels. While discovered resource volumes are decreasing, companies are reallocating capital and operating expense (opex) dollars to stymie output losses from producing fields. Well capex and field direct opex levels are key drivers of decline rates. And while total real capex is still below 2019 levels, real well capex is forecast at record levels of USD 300 billion. Whereas facility capex has only recovered to 70% of its 2014 peak in real terms, field direct opex is at record levels when viewed in real or nominal terms. SLB, rebranded from Schlumberger in 2022 and the world’s largest oilfield services company, stated in its Q1 2024 earnings call that its customers consider increased production recovery from existing assets to be critical in the coming years while current period revenue from opex-driven well interventions has soared. Baker Hughes’ CEO recently echoed the sentiment that the oil industry is currently either in the beginning or middle of an opex-spend cycle. When looking at total upstream oil spend of well capex, facility capex and field direct opex, the share of facility spend has been falling constantly, from 30% at the 2014 peak to 21% this year. Meanwhile, outlays on wells have remained constant at around 40% and field direct opex spend has increased from 30% of the total to close to 40% today. 0 5 000 10 000 15 000 20 000 25 000 30 000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Million bbl Russia Europe North America South America Africa Middle East Asia Australia Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 57 IEA.

The rotation in capital allocation has seen the shift toward short-cycle investment in shale wells and infrastructure-led offshore expansions, both of which inherently have higher percentage of spend directed towards wells.

Due to the natural decline rate of oil and gas production from conventional and tight reservoirs, close to 5 mb/d of supply needs to be replaced annually to hold production flat.

The increase in opex spend since Covid-19 has helped hold replacement volumes steady even as more output comes from high-decline shale barrels. The growing share of light tight oil (LTO) has important implications for observed decline rates. There was a 2.7 mb/d decline in production from existing US shale wells last year on a production base of 9 mb/d, while non-OPEC+ conventional oil output declined by 2 mb/d on a 40 mb/d base. Understanding the different segments of supply and how their decline rates evolve over the medium-term is key to determining the path of supply and investment. OPEC+ supply Middle East drives OPEC+ capacity increase OPEC+ oil production capacity, including condensates and NGLs, is forecast to grow by a net 1.4 mb/d from 2023 through 2030 led by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq. Significantly, nearly 1 mb/d of NGLs and condensates are forecast to be added in the medium-term thanks largely to Saudi Arabia’s Jafurah gas field development. By contrast, total OPEC+ crude capacity is projected to rise by 460 kb/d. The UAE and Iraq are expected to lift crude oil capacity by a combined 1.4 mb/d by 2030. Middle East producers, along with Kazakhstan, will more than offset losses from Mexico, Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa and Asia. The OPEC+ alliance will see its share of world oil production ease below 50% from this year onwards as non-OPEC+ countries dominate growth. Angola quit the group at the start of 2024, reducing its ranks to 22 members. Brazil has signed on to the OPEC+ “Charter of Cooperation” but this agreement does not subject the country to production quotas. As such, Brazil remains in our non-OPEC+ classification. The producer alliance is meanwhile courting countries such as Guyana and Namibia as potential new recruits. In 2023, total oil supplies, including condensates and NGLs, from the OPEC+ alliance fell by 370 kb/d to an average 50.7 mb/d. Saudi Arabia’s production was down by more than 900 kb/d on average due to OPEC+ curbs, while some other members of the bloc with output targets posted very modest reductions. The group’s overall decline was partly offset by Iran, exempt from supply quotas, which pushed output to a five-year high. This year could see a steeper decline of 740 kb/d for OPEC+ if existing extra voluntary curbs remain in place. The producer group agreed to reduce supply in late 2022 to support the market as the economic outlook worsened. Led by Saudi Arabia, additional voluntary curbs from some members in 2023 have further reduced the bloc’s output ceiling. In early June, Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 59 IEA. CC BY 4.0. OPEC+ extended those cuts through the third quarter of 2024 and provided a timeline for unwinding them – subject to market conditions. Saudi, UAE fuel gains in OPEC+ oil capacity Saudi Arabia is set to lead OPEC+ oil capacity growth, with virtually all its gains in NGLs and condensate. By contrast, the country’s crude capacity remains broadly unchanged over the period. Aramco is tapping into its giant unconventional Jafurah gas field and could add around 1 mb/d of total liquids production by the end of the outlook period. This non-associated gas field is due to start up in 2025 and once fully onstream in 2030 is expected to yield roughly 870 kb/d of condensates and NGLs, of which around 270 kb/d is ethane. Saudi Aramco is set to continue investing heavily in the expansion of its natural gas production capacity until at least the end of this decade. With oil demand growth shifting more towards petrochemicals and light ends, the planned liquid increases from Jafurah would be well aligned with this changing pattern.

Riyadh unexpectedly suspended plans for a 1 mb/d expansion in crude oil production capacity to 13 mb/d in January 2024, a target originally set in 2020. As a result, crude oil production capacity, including the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, is expected to remain broadly steady over the next seven years. As recently as November 2023, Saudi Aramco indicated it was on track to hit the 13 mb/d capacity goal by 2027 and was spending billions to do so. After the announcement at the start of this year, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman was quoted as saying: “We have postponed this investment simply because we’re transitioning.” -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 mb/d Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 60 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Expansions at Safaniyah and Manifa that were part of the planned increase are now on hold, but three other projects are going ahead to help offset declines at mature oil fields. Marjan and Berri are due to come online by 2025 and add a combined 550 kb/d while the capacity of the Zuluf field is on course to increase by 600 kb/d by 2026. Aramco has announced a capital expenditure budget of USD 48-58 billion for 2024 compared to USD 49.7 billion in 2023. It still plans to grow capex beyond 2024, until around the middle of the decade despite a reduction of around USD 40 billion for the 2024-2028 period after Riyadh put its crude oil capacity expansion on hold. The reduction is due mainly to the deferral of offshore projects such as Safaniyah and Manifa and lower infill drilling as the Kingdom sustains its maximum production capacity of 12 mb/d, excluding the Neutral Zone. Saudi Arabia estimated crude oil production and capacity, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Production projection based on the current OPEC+ supply deal. Since the fourth quarter of 2022, Riyadh has been slashing output via extra voluntary OPEC+ cuts amid booming US volumes and robust growth from Brazil and Guyana, amongst others. Having cumulatively shut in close to 2 mb/d of supply since Q3 2022, it is now pumping 9 mb/d of crude oil – a level we have held throughout this outlook. Barring the 2020-2021 Covid period, that’s the lowest level since 2011. As a result, Saudi Arabia is holding spare crude oil capacity of over 3 mb/d – well above the 2 mb/d average for the past two decades. For Aramco, the size of that buffer makes it less urgent in the short-term to raise production capacity beyond the current 12 mb/d. That raises the question of when, or if, Aramco would need to reactivate its capacity expansion plan, especially given the cost of sustaining idle capacity. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Capacity Production Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 61 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The UAE is set to provide the biggest increase in crude oil production capacity within the OPEC+ bloc, adding 800 kb/d by 2030 as it continues with its ambitious expansion. Annual average crude output in 2023 hovered near an all-time high of 3.3 mb/d. Its comparatively low-cost resource base and secure operating environment have reinforced the UAE’s expansion scheme. We estimate that capacity will grow to 5 mb/d in 2030. Thus, holding the UAE at current production of around 3.3 mb/d throughout the outlook would leave it with close to 1.8 mb/d of spare at the end of the decade. UAE estimated crude oil production and capacity, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Production projection based on the current OPEC+ supply deal. Offshore oil fields are vital to the build-up. Capacity at the Exxon-operated Upper Zakum field, one of the world’s largest, is around 1 mb/d and further growth towards 1.2 mb/d is planned over the forecast period. At the 275 kb/d Umm Shaif field, the plan is to raise capacity by 115 kb/d by the end of 2027. A short-term increment of 20 kb/d is planned for the 450 kb/d Lower Zakum field, with a further 50 kb/d to be added by 2027. In March, the 45 kb/d capacity Belbazem offshore block, where first oil was initially due in 2023, started up. For the onshore sector, which produces its prized Murban crude, the focus is on lifting capacity by 100 kb/d at the 650 kb/d Bu Hasa, the largest onshore oil field, and by 90 kb/d at the 450 kb/d Bab field by 2027. To support gains, Adnoc has carried out onshore and offshore licensing rounds. Iraq is poised to deliver crude oil capacity growth of 630 kb/d to reach 5.4 mb/d in 2030, largely through the brownfield expansion of its massive southern fields. As for actual supply, in 2023 the country pumped at an annual rate of 4.3 mb/d. This year, it is expected to produce similar volumes, which would leave it with roughly 600 kb/d of spare capacity.

In the short-term, the installation of new pumps has lifted export capacity in the south to 3.5 mb/d. The long-delayed start-up of a fifth single point mooring buoy would add another 500 kb/d to export capacity. Despite the above-ground challenges that can hamper project execution, Iraq is straddling some of the world’s largest and lowest cost resources. The southern oil hub of Basrah, where international oil companies (IOCs) are involved in mega projects, will provide most of the capacity gains over the medium-term.

Water injection will be vital and, to that end, TotalEnergies will play a crucial role. Baghdad and TotalEnergies formally signed a long-delayed deal that aims to raise energy production with investments of more than USD 10 billion. Included in the first phase is a project to inject 5 mb/d of treated seawater into core southern oil fields such as Zubair and West Qurna to sustain pressure. TotalEnergies also intends to raise output at the Ratawi oil field from 85 kb/d to 210 kb/d and build a large solar power plant. The deal was initially signed in 2021 and finally closed in April 2023 when Baghdad accepted a smaller 30% share. TotalEnergies will hold 45% and QatarEnergy 25%. At West Qurna-1, PetroChina has taken over as operator following ExxonMobil’s official departure with plans to raise capacity from roughly 550 kb/d to 600 kb/d by the end of 2024 and towards 700 kb/d in the longer term. At West Qurna-2, Lukoil and Baghdad have agreed to extend the service contract for the field by 10 years to 2045 and gradually boost capacity from 480 kb/d to 800 kb/d.

The northern Kirkuk oil fields and capacity that is controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) are expected to contribute only marginal growth. Shipments of roughly 450 kb/d along the Iraq-Türkiye pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean terminal of Ceyhan have been halted since the end of March 2023, forcing the shut-in of more than 200 kb/d of the KRG’s production. Around 200 kb/d is reportedly moving into the local market or trucked across its borders. Kuwait estimated crude oil production and capacity, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Kuwait is projected to deliver a 180 kb/d increase in capacity to just above 3 mb/d over the seven-year forecast period. Annual average crude oil production in 2023 fell 80 kb/d to 2.6 mb/d. Kuwaiti capacity had been slipping since 2018 due to ongoing field declines, falling 250 kb/d to roughly 2.8 mb/d in 2021. Since then, it has been edging higher and should reach nearly 2.9 mb/d this year. The giant Burgan oil field in the south has suffered steep declines, but the Kuwait Oil Co says a continuous effort is being made to increase its production capacity. We see Kuwait’s share of capacity in the Neutral Zone holding at around 250 kb/d. Kuwait is meanwhile striving to reach capacity of 3.2 mb/d by 2028 through an ambitious drilling programme, construction of two gathering centres as well as water injection facilities and other infrastructure that are now underway. However, reaching that capacity goal may yet prove elusive. Upgrading and developing Kuwait’s complex and ageing oil fields will demand substantial investment to support the drilling effort along with more costly enhanced oil recovery technology. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Capacity Production Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 64 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Iran ramps up supply but sanctions stall capacity growth Iran has continued to ramp up crude oil production despite sanctions by steadily increasing exports to China, its main customer. It ranked as the world’s second-largest source of supply growth after the United States in 2023, with crude oil output up 450 kb/d y-o-y to nearly 3 mb/d, the highest since end-2018. That left it with around 800 kb/d of spare crude oil capacity. In the meantime, official talks to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which would ease sanctions, have been on hold since late 2022. Tehran appears to be keeping up brisk oil sales, primarily destined for China, that have climbed to around 1.6 mb/d. Before the former US administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal (JCPOA) in 2018, exports of Iranian oil, including condensates, had been running above 2 mb/d. To support the higher export flows, Iran has reportedly raised operational capacity at the Kharg Island export terminal by 1 mb/d. Higher exports and domestic throughput pushed Iranian crude production up to around 3.3 mb/d by June 2024 and we have held that level throughout the remainder of the forecast period. Iran crude oil production, 1986-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. On the capacity front, we believe Iran is still able to maintain its extensive oil network, which will allow it to ramp up relatively swiftly to full capacity if and when sanctions are eased. Lower wellhead output most likely prompted the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) to shut in wells at its high-cost offshore fields and carry out maintenance at its ageing oil fields. Shutting in output can be helpful for mature oil fields as it will allow pressure to rebuild and make it easier for operations to restart. As for efforts to sustain and expand its existing crude capacity, Iran is turning inward given the lack of foreign investment due to sanctions.

Tehran is meanwhile looking to the core West Karun oil fields of North and South Azadegan, Yaran and Yadavaran to drive future growth of 1 mb/d. The oil province in the southwest is currently producing around 450 kb/d. Iranian companies have reportedly increased output by 50 kb/d at the smaller West Karun fields of Jofeyr and Sepehr. And NIOC has signed USD 13 billion in contracts aimed at raising output by 400 kb/d to 620 kb/d at the onshore fields of Azadegan, Azar 2, Saman, Delavarn, Soomar and Masjid Suleiman. OPEC crude oil production capacity (mb/d), 2023-2030 Oil output in Oman, including condensates and NGLs, was around 1.1 mb/d in 2023. The ongoing development of offshore fields such as Block 50, the start-up of onshore fields including Blocks 62 and 65 and those offered in its 2021 bid round are expected to help sustain crude oil production capacity. Russian growth trajectory upended by war on Ukraine Russian oil supply is holding up following its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, but sanctions have stymied its growth story. Our pre-war estimate for Russia showed oil production rising by 100 kb/d to reach 11.3 mb/d in 2025 before edging lower. Our current outlook is running close to 600 kb/d below that early 2022 estimate. Overall, however, the country’s oil sector has shown resilience, ramping up drilling in its Western Siberian oil hub and with crude and product exports rerouted to new markets. In 2023, total oil supply fell by a marginal 130 kb/d to 11 mb/d. This year oil production is expected to decline by a further 260 kb/d to 10.7 mb/d as the country carries out deeper OPEC+ production cuts. 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 Algeria 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.9 0.9 -0.1 Congo 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 -0.1 Equatorial Guinea 0.06 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.05 0.04 0.04 0.04 -0.03 Gabon 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 -0.1 Iran 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 3.8 0.0 Iraq 4.8 4.9 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 0.6 Kuwait 2.8 2.9 2.9 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 0.2 Libya 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 0.0 Nigeria 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.2 -0.2 Saudi Arabia 12.2 12.2 12.3 12.3 12.3 12.3 12.3 12.3 0.1 UAE 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 0.8 Venezuela 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.1 Total OPEC 32.7 33.1 33.3 33.5 33.6 33.8 33.9 34.1 1.4 Annual Change 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 OPEC Crude Oil Production Capacity (million barrels per day) Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 66 IEA.

But we expect supply to hold broadly steady through 2030 as top Russian producer Rosneft taps further into its giant Vostok Oil project, which helps to offset declines at its ageing oil fields. Furthermore, its ability to self-finance its oil industry operations and its access to Chinese kit may help fend off a sharp decline in the medium-term. Russia total oil supply, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Moscow had been hoping that its massive resources in the Arctic would provide growth to bolster output. But development of those hard-to-recover reserves will be more difficult and expensive than conventional fields. And given the current environment, it will prove a challenge for Rosneft’s Vostok Oil mega project, a vital source of Arctic growth, to hit its ambitious targets. Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, has reportedly suggested the project could require more than USD 120 billion to tap. The aim is for the Vostok scheme to launch 600 kb/d by the end this year and eventually produce more than 2 mb/d. The reported 2024 plan is for half the Vostok volume to be pumped from the operational Vankor and neighbouring Suzunskoye and Lodochnoye fields. The remaining 300 kb/d is due to come online from the fields of Payakha, Ichemminskoye and Baikalovskoye. Production in neighbouring countries will be supported by the further expansion of Tengiz in Kazakhstan and the start up in Azerbaijan of the BP-led Azeri Central East (ACE) platform. In Kazakhstan, total oil output increased by 110 kb/d to 1.9 mb/d in 2023 and is expected to rise to a record 2.15 mb/d in 2026 and then taper lower through the end of the forecast. Next year could see a significant boost in output, provided the giant Tengiz oil field expansion starts up as planned.

The current cost estimate for the expansion is USD 46.7 billion compared to an initial estimate in 2016 of USD 37 billion. At the giant Kashagan oil field, the plan is to raise output to around 450 kb/d from 2025 onwards. The field is now producing roughly 400 kb/d. Total oil supply from Azerbaijan slipped 50 kb/d in 2023 to 620 kb/d and is forecast to hover around that level through 2026 before easing again through 2030. Output has been falling for years, but BP’s recent start of the new ACE platform in the Caspian Sea will help halt declines at the giant Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) offshore field. Production from the USD 6 billion ACE project should reach 24 kb/d by the end of this year as additional wells are brought online, with further gains towards its 100 kb/d capacity in 2025-2026. After reaching an annual average peak of roughly 840 kb/d in 2009, ACG pumped about 360 kb/d in 2023. Downward spiral for African OPEC+ Apart from Libya, African OPEC+ members are expected to see output decline over the seven-year period as producers fail to coax sufficient investment to stem losses. Nigeria saw its crude output rebound from 40-year lows to reach 1.2 mb/d in 2023 after major export streams recovered.

Shell, ExxonMobil, Equinor and Eni have announced divestment plans for onshore and shallow-water assets. But there are some encouraging signs. TotalEnergies announced a shallow-water oil and gas discovery in offshore Block OML 102 (Ntokon) that it plans to develop as a tie-back to production facilities for the Okon field. On the condensate front, TotalEnergies and its partners have started up the offshore Akpo West field – a tie-back to the existing Akpo floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), which pumped around 120 kb/d in 2023. Akpo West will add 15 kb/d of condensates by mid-2024 and up to 4 million cubic metres per day of gas by 2028. Relative stability throughout 2023 allowed Libya’s crude output to rise 160 kb/d to an average 1.16 mb/d. But this year kicked off with the country's National Oil Corporation declaring force majeure at the 300 kb/d Sharara oilfield due to protests in the area. After a three-week closure, overall crude output recovered to 1.18 mb/d. As for capacity, we see levels holding broadly steady at around 1.2 mb/d over the seven-year period. There is significant upside potential, however, depending on political stability and investment. The North African producer’s oil fields and terminals are often targeted by political factions or militants and that is likely to make its official 2 mb/d production target largely aspirational. To expand output, Libya plans to rely on a combination of brownfield and greenfield projects but for now it is concentrating on stabilising current production. To do so, it must depend on the southwestern Sharara oil field, the country’s largest. The nearby Elephant field can pump up to 80 kb/d. In the east, the Abu Attifel and Zueitina oil fields can each contribute around 70 kb/d. Other oil fields in the east operated by Arabian Gulf Oil Co (Agoco) and Sirte Oil Co can produce around 200 kb/d and 80 kb/d, respectively. The offshore Bouri and al-Jurf fields add 80 kb/d between them. Located in the northeast Sirte Basin, the Waha Oil Co, with current capacity of roughly 400 kb/d, would be key to any further growth. Mexico slumps, Venezuela stabilises Mexico posts the largest drop in output, not just among the OPEC+ alliance, but out of all producers – falling 640 kb/d to 1.5 mb/d. Its long-term oil production decline showed a brief respite from 2021-2023 as the Quesqui condensate field ramped up in earnest. The sector has floundered since the pandemic when Pemex severely curtailed investments. Since then, the state-owned operator has dealt with a continued string of serious incidents with its offshore platforms, undermining public and partner trust. Additionally, the administration has requested they focus on quick crude production growth from onshore and shallow-water fields to the Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 69 IEA.

Mexico total production and contribution by new fields IEA. CC BY 4.0. Looking forward, the picture doesn’t change much, with only two major projects expected to start up over the forecast period – the 100 kb/d Trion field and the 80 kb/d Pit project. And unlike some of its neighbours, Mexico doesn’t have a robust queue of other pre-sanctioned projects waiting to backfill production as existing fields mature. Crude production in Venezuela was up for a third straight year in 2023, rising by 70 kb/d to 770 kb/d, thanks mostly to Chevron’s return after Washington granted it a licence to restart operations. Output this year is on track to top the 800 kb/d mark. That is still down around 70% from 2015, when it stood at nearly 2.5 mb/d. We do not expect significant short-term upside as capacity is currently constrained by long overdue maintenance, modest operational enhancements and US sanctions. Consequently, we are holding our crude oil capacity estimate at 880 kb/d through the remainder of the forecast, although a turnaround in the political situation would provide the opportunity to rebuild the energy sector. It was election concerns related to the government of President Nicolas Maduro that led Washington on 17 April to reinstate sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector with a 45-day window to wind down operations. The move did not affect Chevron – it continues to keep its licence to operate. And Washington continues to issue individual licences for companies in the energy sector. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 mb/d KMZ Cantarell Other Baseline New fields 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 Priority fields Hokchi Amoca Ichalkil Ayatsil Pit Trion Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 70 IEA.

(PDVSA) – PetroPiar, PetroIndependencia, PetroBoscan and PetroIndependiente – can produce oil (including importing diluent) and the US company can lift that oil as repayment for investments it has made in Venezuelan assets. Washington also has reportedly granted Maurel & Prom a licence to continue its upstream work at the Urdaneta Oeste field in Lake Maracaibo through May 2026. The French independent intends to raise output from around 16 kb/d to 25 kb/d by the end of this year. Repsol also received US approval to continue and expand its Venezuelan joint venture oil and gas operations. PDVSA is meanwhile aiming to lift output by reopening wells and carrying out maintenance in its vast Orinoco Belt. Any longer-term recovery in production would require replacing lost professional skills and investment capital. Non-OPEC+ supply Non-OPEC+ supply growth led by the Americas The Americas drive a 4.6 mb/d increase in non-OPEC+ oil production over the seven-year forecast period. A further 1.3 mb/d of supply could be added if pre-FID (final investment decision) projects are sanctioned in the near-term. US growth continues to be led by light tight oil developments, specifically the Permian Basin. Guyana, powered by the ExxonMobil-led Stabroek Block, has emerged as a substantial producer, and explorers continue to find new resources in its territorial waters. Brazil is set to ramp up production with Petrobras and other large oil companies continuing the FPSO-factory development of pre-salt reservoirs.

Other West African countries also shine as Senegal joins the producers’ club this year and Niger ramps up output after a new export pipeline came into service. Angola sees first oil from four new projects with a combined 270 kb/d of capacity. Yet other parts of the continent continue to struggle. Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique all see continued project delays while the Lake Albert development in Uganda is slowly progressing after the host government tacked eastward to China for financing and insurance guarantees. Other parts of the non-OPEC+ world continue to slump. The North Sea is on the front line of the energy transition, with secure, stable and low-carbon production; yet faces some of the greatest opposition to hydrocarbon extraction in the world. A decade-long decline in Asia Pacific oil production, excluding China, continues as companies prioritise gas developments. Other legacy South American producers have seen increased political risk, hampering an already dim development outlook. Resilient yet slower US production growth Questions over US oil and gas industry resilience were answered last year as total liquids increased by 1.5 mb/d, after rising by 1.2 mb/d in 2022. Oil supply is expected to expand by a further 660 kb/d in 2024, reaching a third consecutive record high. While US output is set to increase every year through the end of the forecast period, the pace of growth slows markedly as producers navigate shareholder requirements, complex wells and a tighter regulatory environment. 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2023-30 OECD 29.0 29.7 30.6 30.8 31.0 31.1 31.1 31.1 2.2 OECD Americas 25.3 26.1 26.8 27.2 27.5 27.7 27.8 28.0 2.7 OECD Europe 3.2 3.2 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 -0.4 OECD Asia Oceania 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 -0.1 Non-OECD 17.1 17.6 18.1 18.6 18.9 19.3 19.3 18.8 1.7 FSU 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.0 Europe 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 China 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.0 -0.3 Other Asia 2.0 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7 1.6 -0.4 Non-OECD Americas 6.2 6.5 6.9 7.5 7.7 8.1 8.2 7.8 1.7 Middle East 1.9 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.1 2.3 2.4 2.5 0.6 Africa 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.6 2.5 2.5 0.2 Non-OPEC+ Oil Supply 46.0 47.3 48.6 49.4 49.8 50.4 50.4 49.9 3.8 Processing Gains 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 0.1 Global Biofuels 3.1 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.7 0.6 Total-Non-OPEC+ Supply 51.5 53.0 54.4 55.4 55.8 56.5 56.5 56.1 4.6 Annual Change 1.4 1.5 0.9 0.5 0.7 0.0 -0.4 Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 72 IEA. CC BY 4.0. US growth expectations moderate over the decade IEA. CC BY 4.0. The United States is the largest contributor to medium-term supply growth, adding 2.1 mb/d by 2030, bringing total supply to 21.5 mb/d. Crude oil production is forecast to increase by 1.2 mb/d to 14.1 mb/d. NGLs from processing plants are set to rise by 920 kb/d to 7.4 mb/d, led by both higher exports and domestic petrochemical facility utilisation rates as Permian Basin associated gas continues to drive growth. US crude oil production will set new record highs in each year of this decade. The increase is led by LTO, primarily from the Permian Basin. The shale patch has continued to mature financially to a lower growth trajectory after a wave of M&A reinforced disciplined investing, deleveraging and returning cash to shareholders. The next stage of industry evolution will likely surround inventory management, value chain integration and emissions profiles. US LTO production increases by 1.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, reaching 10.6 mb/d, while conventional Lower 48 output is expected to decline by 590 kb/d over the same timeframe. Overall shale production rises just below a 3% compound annual growth rate, with the Permian Basin providing approximately 80% of it. Gains are front-loaded, with 420 kb/d of additions this year slowing to just 190 kb/d in 2030. While LTO remains the major engine of US oil production, annual increases across all basins slow from the 9% rate posted coming out of the pandemic to just below 3% towards the end of the decade. Headwinds to growth come amid capital discipline, a recent wave of consolidations, and challenges to productivity and profitability metrics. 0 5 10 15 20 25 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 mb/d LTO Gulf of Mexico Alaska Other Crude NGLs Other Liquids US total oil supply - 1 0 1 2 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 US total oil supply growth (y-o-y) Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 73 IEA.

Over the last 24 months, the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) has fallen by 800 to a decade low around 4 500, according to the Energy Information Administration Drilling Productivity Report (EIA DPR). DUCs provide operational buffers, allowing companies to optimise their field development planning. DUCs can normally be fracked and brought online in two months compared to the nine to 12 months it takes to drill and bring on a new well. The industry is now operating as close to a just-in-time inventory model as it ever has. The exceptionally low level of DUCs combined with reduced activity rates and a structurally tighter oilfield services market moving forward present headwinds to growth over the coming years. Additionally, the large wave of recent M&A has led us to reduce price responsiveness assumed in our model moving forward due to longer planning horizons and capital allocation processes of large corporations. Moreover, after almost consistently falling since 2015, wellhead breakeven prices have risen steadily since 2021. Well costs per barrel have also increased across all key basins for the second year running. Drilling rig rates have fallen with activity levels over the last 12 months, but that only represents 33% of total well costs while completion costs can make up close to 60% of well costs. The high grading of frack spreads, advanced completion techniques – such as simul-fracs – and longer laterals have increased well costs while allowing operators to continue to realise production gains at the expense of profitability metrics. When normalising for lateral length, initial production rates on a 30-, 90- or 180-day basis across all major basins declined in 2023, with the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken showing three consecutive years of degradation. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 2027 2029 mb/d US LTO production Midland Delaware Bakken Eagle Ford DJ/Niobrara Other 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 2017 2019 2021 2023 $/bbl Well cost per barrel Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 74 IEA.

Shale price sensitivity scenarios For modelling purposes, this report assumes that 25% of production is responsive to forward strip pricing with the other 75% less price responsive due to long-term corporate planning, hedging programmes or other factors. We have also adjusted our forecast to account for the trends seen in productivity and DUCs. These elements, combined with a correlation of completion activity to margins, forms the basis of our forecast. The responsiveness of the model, and in our view the industry, has been reduced from last year’s forecast based on the above dynamics. In our base case, LTO output is expected to rise by 1.7 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, reaching 10.6 mb/d. While sustained higher prices will drive increased activity and extra barrels, the ceiling is lower than previously thought. But should prices stay below the threshold for drilling new wells, producers and oilfield service companies are expected to respond swiftly. Our high-price sensitivity case estimates that an incremental 550 kb/d of production could come online by 2030 whereas our low-price sensitivity anticipates roughly 1.6 mb/d of downside potential. Oil prices used for the base case are based on a spot crude price of USD 85/bbl for Brent. We assume this level remains constant in real terms over the forecasting period and forms the basis for the non-responsive portion of pricing. The high-price scenario assumes oil prices increase 2.5% in real terms per annum. In the low-price scenario, estimates of future spot prices are based on the ICE Brent forward curve then discounted to real terms. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Midland Delaware Eagle Ford Bakken DJ Basin 1000 feet 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Lateral Length 0 40 80 120 160 Midland Delaware Eagle Ford Bakken DJ Basin Normalized IP90 rates b/d per 1000 feet Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 75 IEA.

The 80 kb/d Santos-operated Pikka Phase 1 development and the 150 kb/d ConocoPhillips Willow project are expected to start in 2026 and 2029, respectively. Alaskan output will increase by 35% to 590 kb/d when these fields start up. Offshore production from the US GoM is expected to rise by 250 kb/d between 2023 and 2026, peaking at 2.1 mb/d. Output will then retreat to 1.8 mb/d in 2030, 100 kb/d below current levels, as a dearth of sanctioned projects leads to an overall decline. Three major projects are set to see first oil in 2024 and another two will be commissioned in 2025 for 350 kb/d of new capacity. After that, Shell’s Sparta is the only other major project that has been sanctioned in the area, with 60 kb/d expected to come online in 2028. While not included in our baseline forecast, Beacon Energy may soon sanction its 60 kb/d Shenandoah tie-back (Walker Ridge 316) while BP may take FID on its 70 kb/d Kaskida project. If approved, production could come online in 2026 and 2029, respectively. An additional 250 kb/d of pre-FID production capacity could come online by the end of the decade with close to half of it operated by BP and the remainder spread between Shell, LLOG and Beacon Energy. The results from the federal US Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261 held in December 2023 achieved the highest gross receipts in eight years and, similar to Lease Sale 259, reconfirmed that companies are interested in maintaining a footprint in the GoM.

US federal offshore lease sales are planned in five-year blocks with the 2024-2029 timeframe expected to see three auctions (2025, 2027 and 2029) compared to the 11 held from 2017-2022 (note that Lease Sale 259 and 261 were held in 2023 but were authorized under the previous plan). US NGLs will expand by 920 kb/d, slightly more than the gains expected from Guyana, the second-largest source of non-OPEC+ supply growth. While decelerating, NGL growth isn’t forecast to slow as sharply as US LTO growth as gas-oil ratios (GOR) have been increasing across key shale basins due to reservoir dynamics and new drilling location quality. Last year, US NGL supply was comprised of 41% ethane, 31% propane, 16% butane and 12% pentane plus (on a volumetric basis). In recent years, growth in NGLs has been divorced from natural gas prices as associated gas production in the Permian Basin has accounted for the bulk of the increase. Close to 25% of Permian hydrocarbon output is gas yet only 7% of the revenue from the basin is derived from gas sales. Additionally, this year has seen Waha pricing (the local Permian sales point) for gas briefly turn negative. The Gulf Coast PADD 3 region accounted for 77% of total US ethane growth last year and close to 60% of the gains since 2014. Another quarter of the increase is from the gas-rich northeastern plays in PADD 1. Propane volumes will see similar, if slightly less extreme trends, with PADD 3 accounting for 50% of last decade’s growth and Bakken volumes from PADD 4 making up another 10%. Canadian oil sands grow with additional export capacity Canadian production is set to continue its upward trajectory over the forecast period, buoyed by increases in bitumen output and expanded export capacity via the Trans-Mountain Expansion (TMX) pipeline. Optimisation and debottlenecking of operations at oil sands projects will add incremental barrels, while new capital projects are limited in size and scope due to social costs and expectations of carbon tax increases. Additional headwinds to growth will come from capital discipline and shareholder distributions. By 2030, supply will be just above 6.5 mb/d, 680 kb/d higher than in 2023. Canadian offshore output is set to remain broadly flat at around 200 kb/d as renewed interest in the province does little more than offset base decline. Last year saw the Suncor-led 30 kb/d Terra Nova FPSO restart. The Cenovus-led West White Rose project has been progressing and is slated to bring up to 80 kb/d to the market starting in 2026 – extending the asset life by over a decade. Outside of that, interest is muted with Equinor the only company to have recently drilled successful exploration wells in the area. Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 77 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The once beleaguered project offers a welcome relief to producers as last winter saw a surge in output after turnarounds, increasing rail car usage while depressing local differentials relative to WTI. The new pipeline will also open additional capacity to Asia and US West Coast refineries.

Prolific resources tapped in Brazilian offshore pre-salt reservoirs, the Stabroek Block in offshore Guyana and the Neuquén Basin in Argentina offset declines from mature producers in the rest of the region. Additional barrels could be on the horizon from frontier areas such as Brazil’s Equatorial Margin or Argentina’s North Argentine Basin. More project sanctions needed to maintain Brazilian growth by end of the decade IEA. CC BY 4.0. Brazilian output will rise by 770 kb/d, peaking at 4.6 mb/d in 2029 before retreating to 4.3 mb/d in 2030. Petrobras operated fields are expected to contribute 85% of the increase, while TotalEnergies, Shell, Equinor, CNOOC and CNPC also expand their footprint in Brazil’s prolific offshore. The majority of the projects and expansions are slated for the Santos Basin, currently home to 70% of Brazilian crude production. With a base production decline rate close to 15% per year, any significant project delays or operational issues could put Brazil’s projected growth at risk. Extended production plateaus from robust infill drilling present upside risks to our forecast. Mero and Búzios are two large multi-phase projects that will deploy a combined total of 15 FPSOs by 2028, including seven already in service. Petrobras plans to bring online 11 FPSOs between now and 2029, including six Búzios installations. The Búzios project will have a capacity of close to 2 mb/d after the 11 FPSOs are in service.

CC BY 4.0. Guyana growth driven by recent discoveries in Stabroek Block IEA. CC BY 4.0. Guyana has posted strong growth over the last five years, from producing its first barrel of oil in 2019 to averaging close to 600 kb/d in 2024. The ExxonMobil-led consortium has continued to make discoveries in the prolific Stabroek Block, where current estimates of recoverable oil equivalent resources stand at close to 12 billion barrels and a seventh phase is reportedly in the pipeline but not yet sanctioned. The third FPSO, Prosperity, was brought online in December 2023. Three more sanctioned FPSO vessels totalling 750 kb/d of capacity are expected to be brought online over the next three years. Based on the current project pipeline and in the absence of further sanctioned phases, production could peak close to 1.3 mb/d in 2028 before declining to 1.1 mb/d by 2030. The most promising block for Suriname’s first offshore barrels lies directly east of Guyana. Block 58 is a joint TotalEnergies and APA Corporation owned parcel, with FID anticipated for late 2024. First oil is expected five years after FID, with a FPSO designed to produce between 180-200 kb/d. Three other blocks in the country are promising, with companies in various stages of exploration and appraisal, but even if successful those volumes would likely materialise in the second half of the next decade. Assuming that Block 58 is indeed sanctioned, Suriname’s output would grow from 10 kb/d to 200 kb/d by the end of the decade. Argentina’s main shale patch, the Vaca Muerta in the Neuquén Basin, roared back to life over the last three years despite geopolitical and other above-ground risks.

CC BY 4.0. Additionally, last year saw improvements in liquids takeaway capacity with the completion of the Trans-Andean pipeline revamp. Talks are in place for a potential partnership between YPF and Energy Transfer to build up to 800 kb/d of additional pipeline and export capacity. Creating a global market for Neuquén oil and gas will require large infrastructure investments. Argentina’s LTO is forecast to grow by 520 kb/d to 830 kb/d by 2030, bringing total output from 770 kb/d in 2023 to 1.2 mb/d. By contrast, supply in the rest of Latin America is expected to decline as the lack of investment and projects take their toll on the region’s industry. Peru, currently producing 120 kb/d, has announced plans to boost investment in exploration and production over the next five years, which will mitigate losses but the roadmap to increased volumes remains unclear. Ecuador had stated similar goals in previous years but the referendum on closing the 60 kb/d Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) field, passed during the 2023 election, has chilled the investment climate in the country. The referendum was supposed to close the field within one-year and newly elected President Daniel Noboa had promised to respect the result. Earlier this year, among rising domestic unrest and widespread violence, he had apparently changed his position. This report assumes the ITT field remains operating for the outlook period. Nonetheless, output is projected to fall from 450 kb/d to 390 kb/d by 2030. After the 2022 elections, the Colombian government tacked towards renewables and halted new oil and gas exploration licences. The impacts of this decision will weigh more heavily on oil due to the nature of the country’s hydrocarbon systems and recent offshore gas discoveries. While Colombian mature fields have seen an improvement in maintenance operations and underlying base production rates, supply is expected to continue on a managed decline, falling from 790 kb/d in 2023 to 620 kb/d at the end of the decade. North Sea oil pits energy security against carbon constraints North Sea assets are currently in sharp focus as a UK general election looms and Norwegian courts pumped the brakes on a handful of petroleum development plans. The long-term erosion of North Sea supply has seen a temporary respite since 2022 but is expected to resume after 2025. The United Kingdom is particularly susceptible as volumes are expected to drop 4% per year to a 50-year low of 570 kb/d by 2030, even as three projects come online and companies mull over others. Norway’s situation is different as new projects will lead to a slight boost in output to 2025 when the Johan Sverdrup field will make up close to one in every three Oil 2024 Supply PAGE | 81 IEA. CC BY 4.0. barrels that Norway produces. After that, Norway will begin a downward spiral unless new projects are sanctioned, a prospect that appears more challenging every year. Total North Sea production is forecast to decline by 400 kb/d to 2.4 mb/d by 2030. Investments in Norway delay but do not offset European offshore decline IEA. CC BY 4.0. Net zero ambitions as well as social pressure on governments, major financial institutions and insurers are shaping the future production profile of the North Sea – already undergoing a structural shift as private equity reduces the major’s dominance. Home to some of the lowest emission intensities in the world, Norwegian producers are striving for world class carbon intensity metrics by electrifying upstream facilities to improve their longevity and remain attractive investment prospects. Balancing those ambitions is the need for regional energy security as Europe continues to progress its energy transition. Norway’s crude oil production is expected to grow through 2025 as three new developments started up last year and four more are planned to see first oil this year and next, including the large Johan Castberg project in the Barents Sea. Norway has substantial remaining resources, robust infrastructure and a low-carbon intensity from oil production. Yet a recent court ruling invalidated three field licences, including one that had already started producing. Whether this is a harbinger of shifting attitudes in the country is yet to be seen. Without a continued willingness to sanction new projects, output will fall from its 2025 peak by 340 kb/d to 1.8 mb/d in 2030. The United Kingdom’s five-year production decline is expected to pause in 2025 at 710 kb/d before continuing its downward path through our forecast period.

Qatar grows, China peaks and Other Asia declines Non-OPEC+ Asia Pacific oil production continues to falter due to ageing oil fields, Western company exits and investments increasingly geared towards natural gas. China is the only exception, thanks to high reinvestment rates and a strong government mandate to increase output in the short-term. Regional volumes have fallen by 700 kb/d over the last decade and are poised to decline by a further 13%, or 870 kb/d, by 2030. The three state-owned Chinese companies – Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) – have stepped up their efforts and increased investments to stymie declines, with production having increased by 10% since 2018 to 4.3 mb/d in 2023. This trio has thus far been successful in executing the 14th Five-Year Plan that laid out ambitious energy and climate goals that prioritise energy security and fossil fuel developments. CNPC and Sinopec have been able to arrest the decline in onshore reservoirs while CNOOC has continued to find new offshore reserves and bring them online. These efforts will boost total oil supply to 4.5 mb/d in 2025 before natural declines get the upper hand. Output in 2030 is forecast at 4 mb/d. Asian oil supply by country, 2020-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

If approved this year, production could be started by 2028. The other medium-sized producers – India, Indonesia and Thailand – continue on managed declines with no major projects in the queue to turn around faltering production. Indian output will get a small uplift in 2024 as the 50 kb/d offshore Krishna Godavari Basin Cluster-2 project ramps up and the onshore Rajasthan Basin posts a modest increase. From 710 kb/d in 2024, output falls to 570 kb/d in 2030. Volumes in Indonesia (630 kb/d) and Thailand (330 kb/d) have fallen since 2016 and are forecast to slip by a further 230 kb/d and 80 kb/d, respectively, to 400 kb/d and 250 kb/d by 2030. Indonesia put new bid terms in place during 2023 to attract investment in an effort to supply growing domestic oil and gas consumption with indigenous production. While it is too soon to see if these efforts bear fruit, the country’s upstream regulator SKK Migas estimated that close to USD 16 billion was invested in the country in 2023. Qatari oil supply is set to rise by 600 kb/d over the forecast period after it announced further development of associated condensates from the massive North Field. Its total oil production is due to rise in every year of the forecast to a record 2.4 mb/d in 2030. The country’s 64 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr) LNG expansion will be carried out in three phases: first the 32 Mt/yr North Field East (NFE) followed by the 16 Mt/yr North Field South (NFS) and then the 16 Mt/yr North Field West (NFW). We expect full capacity to be reached after 2030. The three schemes combined are expected to raise LNG capacity from 77 Mt/yr to 142 Mt/yr and increase the volume of NGLs starting from 2026. This latest capacity addition will require the construction of two LNG trains, in addition to the six already underway for the earlier expansions. NFE and NFS are expected to start up in 2026 and 2027, respectively. NFE will have four trains that are due to produce some 260 kb/d of condensate, 130 kb/d of LPG and 70 kb/d of ethane. NFS will have two trains that are slated to produce 130 kb/d of condensate along with 60 kb/d of LPG and 30 kb/d of ethane. Qatar’s crude production is expected to edge up to 650 kb/d by 2030 from around 610 kb/d currently due to new additions at the Al Shaheen and Bul Hanine fields. Bridled optimism builds in Africa Non-OPEC+ African supply is set to increase by 190 kb/d, or 8%, through the forecast period as projects ramp up in Côte d’Ivoire, Niger and Ghana.

Increased investment from APA Corporation, Eni and the Capricorn-Cheiron consortium as well as further bid rounds, will help to flatten declines but aren’t enough to grow future liquids supply. For the last two years, total oil output has remained relatively constant at 600 kb/d. This year and next are expected to average 580 kb/d, with output sliding to 500 kb/d by the end of the decade. Senegal is on track to become an oil producer later this year when Woodside’s 100 kb/d Sangomar FPSO is commissioned. The vessel arrived in coastal waters in February and work is being done to hook up 23 production, injection and gas wells that are part of the first phase. Ghana also sees an uptick in flows this year as the Jubilee Southeast project, commissioned in 2023, ramps up. Total output is forecast to reach 220 kb/d in 2030. Additionally, supply in Niger is expected to increase in 2024 and 2025 as a Chinese built pipeline facilitates increased drilling in the Agadem Rift Basin. Oil production is seen growing by 50 kb/d this year and another 30 kb/d in 2025, before declining through the end of the decade. In Côte d’Ivoire, Eni’s Baleine project saw first oil last year when Phase 1 came online. An additional 30 kb/d of capacity is slated for late 2024 when Phase 2 starts up. Eni has discussed an additional 100 kb/d of output with a Phase 3, but it has not taken an FID and as such is not included in our forecast.

In Namibia’s offshore Orange Basin, another recent find by Galp Energia SA that could be as large as 10 billion barrels brings the country’s potential discovered resource base to a level similar to that of Guyana. TotalEnergies, Shell and QatarEnergy have been performing appraisal and delineation work on their discoveries. While no development plans have been submitted to exploit these fields, they have the potential to catapult Namibian output along a similar path as to Guyana’s early in the next decade. Angola, which quit OPEC at the start of 2024, is expected to see oil supply ease by about 100 kb/d to roughly 1 mb/d by 2030. Its output has been slumping for years due to underperforming assets and operational setbacks. The departure of the West African country from the producer bloc came after it publicly rejected the group’s decision to revise down its 2024 crude oil production ceiling. Angola’s crude oil production plateaued at 1.7-1.8 mb/d from 2008 to 2016 before starting on a decline aggravated by operational issues at its high-cost deepwater oil fields. In an effort to help stem the decline, TotalEnergies has taken an FID on the Kaminho deepwater project, comprising the Cameia and Golfinho fields, where first oil is targeted for 2028 and expected to ramp up to around 70 kb/d. TotalEnergies and CNOOC approved two projects in Uganda near Lake Albert in late 2021 and early 2022, respectively. The projects have been marred by repeated delays, with financing issues and land compensation schemes still hampering progress. FID of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), the project’s only export route, hasn’t been completed as Chinese insurers still need to sign off on it. The 1 440 km heated pipeline has been a source of controversy since it was announced. Environmental campaigners opposed the project and successfully lobbied Western banks not to fund it. The latest setback for the project has pushed our start-up dates for both the Tilenga and Kingfisher fields to 2026. Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 86 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Refining and trade Global summary Decelerating demand growth weighs on refining sector The global refining industry is set to undergo another major step change as it adapts to slowing oil demand growth amid the accelerating transition to clean energy technologies over the 2023-2030 forecast period. Global refining capacity is projected to expand by 3.3 mb/d by the end of the decade, a marked slowdown from historic trends. Despite this more modest rate of capacity expansion, it will still outpace the call on refined products by a factor of nearly three-to-one over the forecast period as non-refined fuels including fractionated NGLs and biofuels increase by a combined 2.5 mb/d. Product demand growth, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Demand net of CTL/GTL, additives, biofuels and direct use of crude. Refiners will need to adjust their product slates to meet the challenge of reduced consumption of road transport fuels, as electric vehicles increase their market share. Moreover, the surge in petrochemical feedstock use – the pillar of oil consumption growth in our outlook – will largely be met by the massive ramp up of NGLs this decade. This, in combination with rising biofuel use – the other source of non-refined fuels – undermines demand for refined product supplies and the need for additional refining capacity. Non-refined fuel products are set to capture more than 75% of additional demand over the 2023-2030 period. 97.4 2.5 1.2 1.2 -0.0 -0.1 0.1 -1.7 100.4 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 2023 Demand LPG/ ethane Naphtha Jet/ kerosene Gasoil/ diesel Fuel oil Other products Gasoline 2030 Demand mb/d Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 87 IEA.

This significant rise in non-refinery product supplies will add pressure on refinery operating rates and, potentially, profitability. Arguably, this pressure might be greatest on catalytic cracking units given weak gasoline demand and strong competition for middle distillates, including vacuum gasoil as a feedstock. The threat of falling utilisation rates in mature demand centres raises the prospect of further capacity closures before the end of the decade. Capacity growth will remain concentrated in Asia, most notably in China and India. However, even these stalwarts of capacity growth will slow down, particularly post-2026.

Rising non-OPEC+ crude supply, in conjunction with international sanctions on Russian crude exports and OPEC+ voluntary cuts, will push higher volumes from the Atlantic Basin to East of Suez over the outlook period. The loss of predominantly medium sour crudes from the Middle East amid OPEC+ output cuts is partially offset by rising Brazilian, Guyanese and Canadian supplies, with the Canadian exports gaining greater access to Asian markets. Light sweet crude grades from US LTO production will continue to find homes in Europe, and increasingly in Africa, India and elsewhere in Asia. Product trade will see higher intra-regional flows East of Suez, driven by Asia, attracting more product supply from the Middle East. Supplies from Russia, which are broadly subject to import sanctions in much of the Atlantic Basin, will continue to head east, although Africa and Latin America may also boost imports over time. Europe’s continuing shortfall in diesel and jet fuel supply, plus North America’s need for jet fuel imports, will focus global competition in middle distillate markets.

The Western Hemisphere, with North and South Americas combined, is the largest incremental supplier of oil to global markets in our forecast period, while the Eastern Hemisphere is the leading driver of demand. Going forward, the disparity between the east and west will add further impetus to global trade flows.

CC BY 4.0. Asia have absorbed increasing crude volumes from the continued surge in US LTO production and heavily discounted Russian Urals exports. Despite two years of exceptionally strong margins, the refining industry now faces two challenges that will drive market dynamics in the coming years and weigh on operating rates and profitability. First, the projected peak in transportation fuel demand in the medium term will pressure utilisation rates. Second, competition in petrochemical feedstock markets from surging NGL production risks swamping light distillate markets. Historically, naphtha could be blended into the gasoline pool. However, by 2030 this flexibility will be limited by ample gasoline supply, relative to demand. This will likely further intensify competition between naphtha and LPG. Adding to these competing sources of LPG and light distillate supply, government mandates will increase the use of renewable and biofuel supplies thereby compounding the pressure on refineries to lower operating rates. Product market dislocations boost Atlantic Basin cracks Longstanding regional product imbalances have seen their price impact magnified by the sanctions-driven oil market dislocations over the past two years.

CC BY 4.0. Similarly, refiners may be able to command a premium for their product pricing. Some refineries may have the operational flexibility to adapt output yields more easily to the rise in middle distillate demand versus the fall in gasoline demand that we expect to see over the forecast period. In addition to these competitive factors, refiners may also sit within an integrated value chain that limits their exposure to these market dynamics. Consequently, the challenges looming on the horizon can, individually or in combination, undermine or even erase a refinery’s competitive position. Of the projected 3.2 mb/d of growth in demand during 2024-2030, more than 75% will be met by non-refined fuels including fractionated NGLs and biofuels, which increase by a combined 2.5 mb/d over the forecast period. We assume that higher cost OECD regions will be more acutely impacted by the rising share of non-refined products than non-OECD regions, but falling utilisation rates will have repercussions that will be felt across the global refining industry by the end of the decade. Refined product demand growth undermined by higher NGLs and biofuels, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Refinery capacity growth is underpinned by a projected 5.1 mb/d of new projects to be completed by the end of the decade, while 1.8 mb/d is forecast to be shut-in, for an overall net increase of 3.3 mb/d. This view is more cautious than envisaged in the Oil 2023 report as several projects that failed to make any discernible progress over the past 12 months have been removed from the project pipeline. Recent record profitability has not triggered a new wave of refinery project and expansion announcements. However, several planned closures have been deferred, as refineries reap the benefits of the strong margins posted in 2022 and 2023.

However, projects that have yet to receive a final investment decision (pre-FID) could yet be completed by 2030 if approvals are made in the very near future. Similarly, projects that have made insufficient progress to be finished within the forecast period could be included if progress accelerates from current rates. Notably, the 1.2 mb/d Ratnagiri refinery in India and the 200 kb/d Lobito refinery in Angola fall into the first and second categories, respectively. Net capacity additions outpace refined product demand growth, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Refiners must navigate an array of challenges to remain competitive How refiners respond to these shifting product and regional demand challenges will depend on a multitude of factors, including access to cheap crude and natural gas, premium pricing locations, operating costs, and yield configurations. Arguably, a vertically integrated value chain from the upstream wellhead, through refining and onto a retail or industrial/commercial consumers, provides an insulated business model that can ignore shifts in value creation across the chain. However, this oversimplifies the complex nature of a returns-focused business that seeks to optimise each aspect of its value creation. Without either a reduction in capacity, lower utilisation, or a material change in yields (such as an integrated petrochemical capacity addition), a refinery facing contracting domestic demand is increasingly exposed to international competition. This shifts a greater share of production from inland CIF-based pricing within the integrated value chain into the inherently weaker FOB-based pricing mechanism as products are exported. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 New sites Expansions Shutdowns Net additions Refined product demand growth mb/d Global Europe Asia North America China Africa Middle East Other Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 93 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Data for mature markets such as Japan indicate that weaker demand initially results in utilisation rates dropping, but ultimately forces capacity to be closed. Falling demand also subjects refined product markets to greater exposure to international trade, as demand and refined products output can become misaligned. Consequently, the above factors point towards an environment where closures are more likely in the Atlantic Basin. Considering the scale and complexity of regional refining industries, Europe stands out as having older, relatively small, and less complex refineries that are more open to international trade than other regions. Conversely, utilisation rates East of Suez remain steady as positive regional demand growth offers some protection from the impact of the energy transition. Furthermore, cost-advantaged locations, access to low-cost crude and proximity to structurally short markets in Asia all play a part.

Vertical axis for both charts is kb/d refinery crude throughput. Right-hand chart is final demand in kb/d on the horizontal axis. Refinery profitability is driven by the balance between crude and product market tightness One lens through which to view refinery profitability is the relative tightness between crude and product markets. If refiners face a disparity in conditions between crude and product markets, then arguably they have three options for handling the mismatch. First, if the margin structure supports it, they can continue to pay up for crude. Second, if they have operational flexibility, refiners can draw crude inventories, which effectively contributes to tighter crude market conditions. Lastly, if margins don’t support processing crude, they can cut runs and thereby transmit weakness in product markets back to crude markets. 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 4 500 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% kb/d Crude runs and international trade share of demand 2 000 2 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 4 500 3 000 3 500 4 000 4 500 5 000 5 500 kb/d kb/d Final demand and crude runs Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 94 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Tightness in both crude and product markets results in outsized returns for refineries as backwardated market structure in crude amplifies the backwardated market structure in product markets and results in extremely strong cracks for products of net importers, e.g. European diesel cracks. Conversely, weaker crude and product market conditions, as witnessed in 2020-2021 implies a tougher operating environment for refineries. Two caveats to this assessment are worth highlighting. First, the refining industry doesn’t have to process crude where margins don’t support it. The demand collapse of 2020 demonstrated the power of enforcing economic run cuts to restore profitability at refineries. Lessons learnt from this episode have likely not been forgotten. Run cuts effectively transfer product market weakness back into crude markets. Second, the refining industry now has a greater share of merchant refineries that can respond more quickly and be operationally and financially disciplined in reacting to changes in market conditions. Demand trends will likely dictate the rate of capacity closures The prospect of refined product demand contracting over the balance of the decade, initially for gasoline, and subsequently for diesel, will require adjustments to activity levels and refinery yield structures that will be signalled by individual product cracks. Some refineries will be forced to cut runs, either proactively or reactively, or, in the longer run, exit the industry. Regional growth in refined product demand, 2022-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Within our assessments for the period through to 2030 we do not explicitly forecast capacity closures beyond those already announced.

The period to 2030 will see the rerouting of Canadian barrels to the Pacific market via the TMX pipeline, and declining Mexican exports of Maya crude. Both these factors will tighten regional crude markets and likely pressure profits and operating rates. Regional refinery utilisation rates, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Refineries production yield structure will need to change This report’s analysis through to 2030 envisions a global refining industry that faces the challenge of meeting strong kerosene and diesel demand growth, while gasoline use drops, even though increasing naphtha demand offers a partial offset. We assume that refineries will adapt to the shifting demand patterns by raising middle distillate yields at the expense of naphtha and gasoline. Gasoline yields will need to shrink globally by 1.3% to contain potential surplus supplies. Notable changes that drive this are in the US refining system, given the typical draw on the middle distillate pool to feed upgrading units, such as catalytic cracking. Elsewhere, a partial offset comes from higher naphtha yields. The Covid-19 demand collapse and subsequent recovery demonstrated that national refining systems can adjust kerosene and diesel production when required by as much as two percentage points. In aggregate the changes required to middle distillate yields to adapt to the 2030 demand mix are neither as dramatic nor as rapid. 65% 75% 85% 95% 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 Utilisation rate FSU Other Asia North America Europe China Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 96 IEA.

Rising supplies of light sweet crude to global markets and the concurrent OPEC+ production policy which restricts the availability of medium and heavy crude have compressed light sweet grades price premiums versus heavy sour crude differentials. Prior to the US shale revolution boosting supply of light sweet crude oil, the marginal barrel available to refineries was typically heavier and sourer than the average. This dynamic gave complex refineries a competitive advantage over less sophisticated refining capacity. US shale oil has inverted this trend and thereby improved the competitiveness of less sophisticated plants that would otherwise be disadvantaged by the lack of upgrading and hydrotreating capacity versus more complex ones. While LTO supplies have been a boon to less complex refineries, complex refineries have had to compete harder for heavy crude supplies and feedstocks to fill upgrading capacity. The analysis contained in this report assumes the current OPEC+ output agreement, including formal, voluntary and additional voluntary cuts, remains in place. Consequently, the global sour crude market is tight in the short term, but becomes increasingly long in the second half of the decade. We assume the majority of the global surplus will result in a product overhang dominated by gasoline components. Crude balances account for about one-third of the surplus, but the need to meet diesel and, more particularly, kerosene demand will drive crude runs higher until late in the decade. -1.5% -1.0% -0.5% 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% LPG Naphtha Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel oil Other products Refined product yield Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 97 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Surging NGL supply undermines refinery profitability In contrast to the mixed impact on refining from higher shale oil supplies, the surge in NGL production and exports from North America has, on balance, increased competition in the petrochemical feedstock markets and been a drag on refineries. Increased integration with petrochemical capacity has long been a preferred way to boost refinery gross margins and absorb unwanted light ends production into higher value product streams. The expansion of ethane- and propane-based petrochemical capacity has marginalised the use of naphtha and mixed-feed crackers in Europe and undermined the profitability of refinery produced propylene. Further increases in NGL production will continue to win market share in petrochemicals and limit refineries’ ability to shift away from gasoline production to increased yields of propane and propylene from their catalytic cracking operations. Furthermore, in tandem with higher NGL supply, mandated increases in both biofuel and renewable fuels use will also dampen the call on refined products. We expect to see gains in competing supplies of kerosene from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), as well as from biodiesel and ethanol. On balance, the combination of new refinery start-ups, predominantly in Asia, demand in the Atlantic Basin falling and increased competition from NGLs, biofuels and renewables raises the risks of further capacity closures. We model falling utilisation rates in OECD Europe and Americas as a proxy for this dynamic. However, the eventual losers in the competitive process will be determined by the trade-off between being in a cost-advantaged area, e.g. the US Gulf Coast, versus being located in a region that remains a net importer for large swathes of its fuel needs, e.g. Europe. The balance between these two factors is complicated by the recent imposition of import embargoes and trade sanctions on Russia by the European Union and the Group of Seven (G7) that have dramatically redrawn oil trade flows and forced European markets to reprice diesel and jet fuel, such that they can attract more volumes from longer haul locations East of Suez. Refining capacity Global refining capacity additions slow after 2026 Over the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, the global refining sector is poised for a period of subdued growth, with nameplate capacity (including condensate splitters) forecast to rise from 104.2 mb/d to 107.4 mb/d. Installed capacity remains more than adequate to meet world demand for refined products of 85.8 mb/d by the end of the forecast period. While capacity increases by a net 3.3 mb/d by 2030, refinery runs are forecast to rise by only 2.1 mb/d and growth in demand for refined Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 98 IEA. CC BY 4.0. products (excluding CTL/GTL, additives, industry direct use of crude oil and fractionated products) by 1.2 mb/d. As demand growth tapers off, global utilisation rates are expected to drop, prompting a rationalisation of capacity. The 3.3 mb/d in net capacity additions over the seven-year period is less than the Oil 2023 forecast of 4.4 mb/d for the 2023-2028 period. This total includes 5.1 mb/d in new projects, offset by 1.8 mb/d in announced closures. Annual net capacity additions average 470 kb/d, a significant decline from the 2010-2019 average of 780 kb/d. Announced capacity closures over the forecast period are lower than the historical average, with more closures likely to be announced in the coming years. For now, 2025 is the peak year for refinery closures, with a total of 800 kb/d of capacity set to go offline. OECD Europe will bear the brunt of this reduction, with four separate closures amounting to 480 kb/d. In the Americas, the United States will see two shutdowns totalling 380 kb/d. Unexpectedly, for regions East of Suez, China will account for nearly 65% of the announced closures, as governmental restrictions on import and export quotas, and regulations on emissions continue to force independent refiners to shut down. Still, these closures, totalling 640 kb/d of capacity, are overshadowed by 1.6 mb/d of new refinery capacity under development. Annual change in global crude distillation capacity, 2008-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. This slowdown in investment in refining capacity is attributed to several factors, including anticipated slower growth in demand, regulations driving the transition away from fossil fuelled vehicles (notably in Europe) and hesitancy among refiners to further expand due to environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy pressures.

Additionally, profitability is constrained by escalating carbon taxes, rising biofuel supply, fuel efficiency regulations and surging EV sales that are all eroding demand for refined transport fuels. Furthermore, uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic climate and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, are set against recent record-level refinery margins, leaving many refiners holding back investment. The post-pandemic years saw a surge in capacity as projects that were delayed by restrictions and supply chain bottlenecks were completed. Projects due onstream from 2024 to 2026 account for around 4.4 mb/d, accounting for most of the 5.1 mb/d of gross additions over the forecast period. Beyond 2026, expected completions are relatively sparse. Against a backdrop of slowing global demand and rising NGL, biofuel and renewable fuel supplies, the next three years may be the last period of net capacity additions. Subsequently, closures, although not explicitly forecast in this report, may well eclipse additions as demand growth for refined products turn negative near the end of the decade. Change in CDU capacity by region, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The regional distribution of net capacity additions remains consistent with previous editions of this report. East of Suez continues to drive capacity growth, accounting for nearly 85% of the increase. New projects in the region will add a net 2.8 mb/d, primarily dominated by developments China, India and the Middle East.

CC BY 4.0. In the Atlantic Basin, new refineries in Nigeria (already commissioned) and Mexico (set to be commissioned in 2025) add a combined 1 mb/d. Shutdowns in OECD regions will partly offset these gains, however, resulting in a net increase of around 500 kb/d. The crude and condensate surplus in the Atlantic Basin grows by 2.7 mb/d, while the deficit in East of Suez expands by 2.8 mb/d, implying increasing crude flows east. Refining capacity at risk of closure is increasing Beyond announced closures, we expect capacity that is at risk of closure (which we define as the surplus capacity beyond that required to meet refined product demand assuming an average 86% utilisation rate) to increase over the course of the decade, as regional utilisation rates drop in the Atlantic Basin. The 2023 global baseline assessment of 8.5 mb/d is inflated by poor utilisation rates in several countries, most notably Mexico, Venezuela, Russia and China, that boost the assessment by nearly 4 mb/d. Excluding these long-term low utilisation countries, capacity at risk of closure increases from 5 mb/d in 2023 to 5.9 mb/d in 2030. By 2030 Europe and North America could each have between 1-1.5 mb/d of at-risk capacity. By contrast, some regions will experience a reduction in spare capacity, notably in China, where improved utilisation rates for refining have been a government objective for several years. Smaller reductions in Africa and Russia come from increased refinery utilisation. Refining capacity at risk of closure from low utilisation, 2012-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0.

CC BY 4.0. exclusion of Russian crude from most Atlantic Basin importers due to sanctions will also support increased flows of crude to the East of Suez. Furthermore, reduced Middle East sour crude exports are partially offset by rising Brazilian and Guyanese oil supplies. US LTO production will boost the supply of light sweet grades to Europe, West Africa as well as to Asia, where Atlantic Basin crude’s market share increases. The global crude balance shifts from a deficit in 2024 to a surplus, by 2030 of 700 kb/d, driven by rising supply and slowing demand growth. Availability of crude surpasses the global import requirements, leading to an opportunity to rebuild global inventories. Net crude oil trade by major regions, 2018-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Regional developments Within the framework of the 2023-2030 outlook, increased capacity of 3.3 mb/d and higher crude runs of 2.1 mb/d both far outweigh the growth in demand for refined products of only 1.3 mb/d. Refining activity in the Atlantic Basin will see utilisation rates drop by 2%, centred mostly in Europe and the Unites States where throughput falls in line with the decline in demand. As a result, output in the region will decrease by 600 kb/d. Conversely, refinery runs East of Suez will grow by 2.7 mb/d, and throughput will continue expanding unabated despite peak oil demand on the horizon. The Middle East, India, China and Africa are set to lead crude throughput growth over the forecast period. - 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 mb/d Middle East FSU Americas Africa Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 102 IEA.

By 2030, the Atlantic Basin surplus in crude and condensates is expected to reach 7.9 mb/d, representing an increase of 2.7 mb/d from 2023. This surplus will primarily consist of light sweet crude, and to a lesser extent medium grades, thanks to rising exports from the United States, Brazil and Guyana.

In California, Phillips 66 ceased processing crude at its 128 kb/d Rodeo facility and has converted the plant to a biofuel facility. Meanwhile, Houston's Lyondell refinery in Texas will shutter its 263 kb/d operation in 2025. A further 500 kb/d of US refinery capacity is at risk by the end of the decade. Despite this potential rationalisation, by 2030, the United States is projected to have a surplus of approximately 5 mb/d in oil products, across LPG/ethane, gasoline, naphtha and diesel. US refined product demand, refining activity and product balances, 2012-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Demand for refined products excludes fractionated products. The combined surplus in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane is forecast to grow by 400 kb/d to 3 mb/d. NGLs supply rises by 900 kb/d, led by the Permian, while domestic demand for ethane and LPG will be less than half of this, resulting in a rising surplus available for the export market. The persistent deficit in the rest of the Americas will likely absorb close to 40% of the US LPG surplus, with the remainder exported to the rest of the world. However, the United States will face competition from the Middle East for market share East of Suez. The global market for light ends and LPG is projected to have an overall surplus and, akin to a game of musical chairs, someone will inevitably be left with excess product.

While a sizeable portion of this will serve refineries on the US West Coast, the potential exists for a substantial portion of the crude to reach Asia, particularly China, which has the capacity to refine substantial quantities of extra heavy crude and bitumen. This shift in trade patterns is also expected to reshape the global shipping industry, as Canadian crude will increasingly compete with heavy crude from other countries, particularly those in Latin America and the Middle East. However, Western Canada’s pipeline export capacity remains at 5.1 mb/d over the balance of the decade. By 2028, crude production is expected to exceed this level, pointing to the use of rail shipments, on an increasingly frequent basis. Despite being one of the largest producers of oil, Mexico will remain a net importer of refined products to meet its domestic demand through the forecast period. Although refinery operations are set to accelerate and demand growth for liquids slows, the country will still need around 300 kb/d of imported fuels in 2030 to meet demand, versus more than 700 kb/d in 2023. Over the past ten years, Mexico's refinery system has operated well below average utilisation rates due to ageing assets. However, it is set for a period of growth in the medium term. State-owned Pemex is investing to upgrade and expand several of its refineries. Our forecast assumes a rise of 11.5% in utilisation rates as this investment programme bears fruit, reaching 63% by 2030. In early 2024, runs hit an eight-year high, and could jump by 400 kb/d over the forecast, reducing the net product import requirements. Pemex will finally complete the long-awaited and heavily delayed Dos Bocas 340 kb/d refinery. Reports of its imminent commissioning have waxed and waned as the project continues to face start-up issues. We anticipate it will come online no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2025, with the full ramp-up taking several years. Once operational, the refinery will significantly reduce Mexico’s dependence on the United States for fuel. It will also cut exports of its heavy sour Mayan crude to the USGC, as these volumes will be refined domestically. The combined impact of these factors will be to reduce heavy sour crude exports from 1.1 mb/d in 2023 to potentially just 130 kb/d by 2030. In Latin America, refinery capacity will increase by 130 kb/d, driven solely by Brazil, closely aligning with the region's demand growth of around 100 kb/d. However, regional crude supply will significantly outpace refinery demand, as an additional 2 mb/d of production from Guyana, Argentina and Brazil comes online. Despite refining capacity increases, the region will remain in a net product importer through the forecast. In Brazil, the Abreu e Lima Refinery (RNEST) Train 1 is operational, with a proposed modernisation project set to expand capacity from 115 kb/d to 130 kb/d Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 105 IEA. CC BY 4.0. by late 2024. The long-stalled Train 2 addition, which had been on hold since 2015, is now progressing and expected to come online by 2028. This expansion aligns with Brazil’s stricter air pollution control programme for on-road heavy-duty and utility vehicles, transforming existing refineries and improving diesel quality. These refineries will combine with a growing biofuels sector to cut Brazil’s domestic diesel and gasoline import requirements by nearly 250 kb/d by 2030. Americas crude oil balances Net crude and condensate exports from the Americas are projected to rise from 4.6 mb/d in 2023 to 8 mb/d by 2030, an increase of 3.4 mb/d. North America's contribution will be significant, with exports rising to 3.6 mb/d by 2030, driven mainly by increased US and Canadian production. Heavy crude exports from Canada and South America, 2012-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Note: Other Americas includes Brazil, Guyana and Argentina, which produce predominantly light to medium grades. The complexity and preferred crude slate of the US’ refining industry means that it remains structurally short of heavy crude. Nevertheless, the United States will narrow its volumetric crude deficit from 3 mb/d in 2023 to just under 1 mb/d by 2030 due to an additional 1.1 mb/d in crude production and our assumption that crude runs decline over the period to 2030. This will push more light sweet crude to export markets. The start-up of the TMX pipeline expansion noted above and the reduction in Mexico’s crude export volumes present a challenge to US Gulf Coast and Midcontinent refineries.

Latin America's growing crude surplus, driven by rising production in Brazil, Argentina and Guyana, is expected to increase by 1.7 mb/d to reach 4.5 mb/d by 2030. However, much of this is insufficiently heavy to be of practical use and will likely meet the Asian crude deficit. However, some heavier crudes could also address the gap in the US Gulf Coast. The re-emergence of better-supplied fuel oil markets, as Middle Eastern power burn drops towards the end of the decade, may provide the USGC with an opportunity to boost upgrading unit feed rates. European demand downturn slashes refinery runs Refining developments in Europe European refinery runs are expected to decline by 1.5 mb/d from 2023 to 2030, in line with the reduction in refined products demand. As a result, close to 1.5 mb/d of refinery capacity will be at risk of closure. Since 2010, Europe has consistently shut refinery capacity, at an annual average rate of 220 kb/d. The Covid-19 demand shock led to the rationalisation of 650 kb/d of capacity during 2020 and 2021, and between 2024 and 2025 refiners will shut an additional 480 kb/d of capacity. Eni closed its 120 kb/d Livorno refinery earlier in 2024, while the UK’s 130 kb/d Grangemouth refinery will be converted to a biofuel facility in 2025. Next year will also see BP close 80 kb/d of capacity at its Gelsenkirchen refinery while Shell will reduce capacity at the Rhineland refinery by 150 kb/d.

The ramp-up of Nigeria’s new refinery could accelerate further European refinery closures if competition for this export market intensifies. European crude oil balances Europe’s crude deficit is expected to narrow from 9.2 mb/d in 2023 to 8.5 mb/d in 2030. Lower refinery runs (-1.1 mb/d) outpace the decline in crude production (-350 kb/d). European refineries will continue to need to attract North American and African crude to meet the shortfall versus production, all the more so given the assumption that the Russian crude import ban remains in place. FSU to ramp up refinery capacity and runs Refining developments in FSU Despite Russia’s current geopolitical challenges, the Former Soviet Union (FSU) is expected to see a net increase of 120 kb/d in refinery capacity from 2023 to 2030.

CC BY 4.0. The region maintains a surplus in both crude and refined products. However, Western sanctions have forced many countries to replace Russian supplies with alternative sources, resulting in a challenging export market for both Russian crude and refined products. Longer term, while the domestic market remains well supplied, the exportable crude surplus contracts due to the impact of sanctions and voluntary OPEC+ cuts. Regional exports of crude and refined products will be 400 kb/d lower, albeit at a still respectable 8.6 mb/d. In 2024 Ukrainian drone strikes at Russian refineries reportedly caused damage to more than a dozen facilities and targeted several more. Cumulatively, these attacks affected over 2 mb/d of gross refinery capacity by mid-year. Despite Western sanctions, international oil markets still rely heavily on Russian exports of diesel, naphtha, and jet fuel, while Asian refining systems absorb significant amounts of Russia’s straight-run and cracked residue for upgrading unit feedstocks. In theory, the return of these refineries to service may have been hindered by international sanctions imposed by the west, which restrict access to equipment and refining technology. Nevertheless, Russia's refining system is large enough to mitigate some of these outages by deferring planned maintenance or increasing runs elsewhere within the system. However, at the time of writing, the full extent of the disruption caused by these attacks remains unclear, with reports that Russian crude processing has been only minimally disrupted. By 2026, Russia's capacity is set to grow by 50 kb/d with the expansion of the Novoshakhtinsk refinery in Rostov Oblast. In other parts of the FSU, Turkmenistan will see a 20 kb/d expansion at its Seydi refinery, Kazakhstan will expand its Ordabasy refinery by 40 kb/d, and Tajikistan will add 10 kb/d at the Danghara refinery. FSU crude oil balances The FSU’s net export position remains stable over the balance of the decade. Net crude exports drop from 6.7 mb/d in 2023 to 6.3 mb/d in 2030 and is largely based on the assumption that continued OPEC+ cuts will impact shipments. Russia’s mainly sour crude has a limited number of export markets in the Atlantic Basin due to Western sanctions, but the country has secured new markets in Asia, mainly India and China. A further drag on Russian crude exports comes from increased domestic refinery runs, assuming a return to normal operating rates post-2025. Consequently, Russian crude surplus volumes are expected to fall from 5.1 mb/d in 2023 to 4.7 mb/d by 2030. Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 109 IEA. CC BY 4.0. African refinery capacity rises to meet stronger demand Refining developments in Africa In Africa, refinery capacity is on track to increase by 750 kb/d over the forecast period, largely in line with the expected growth in refined product demand (+840 kb/d). However, the continent remains heavily dependent on product imports. The inauguration of the 650 kb/d Dangote refinery in Nigeria marks a significant turning point for the region. While still in its start-up phase, the facility is expected to be fully operational in 2025. Additionally, in Ghana, Sentuo Oil Refinery Ltd. (SORL) commissioned Phase 1 of its grassroots refinery in Tema in January. This refinery, capable of processing 40 kb/d of crude oil, is part of Ghana's industrialisation agenda to boost the domestic economy and reduce reliance on imported petroleum products. Despite these developments, by 2030 Africa will still require nearly 2.3 mb/d in imported products to meet growing domestic demand, of which close to 60% will be diesel. Africa crude oil balances North Africa, with declining upstream production, will see its net crude oil exports shrink by 140 kb/d to 1.6 mb/d by 2030. Europe currently processes much of the region’s excess light sweet crude but African production faces tough competition from the Americas and on the margin some supplies may head to East of Suez markets. Similarly, West African net crude exports will shrink in the coming years, as the Dangote refinery reaches full capacity. However, the question remains whether Nigeria will divert domestic production to this plant, or if the country will opt to import increasing volumes of US light sweet crude or Russian Urals. Early crude trade indicate that it is more cost-effective to land US WTI crude in Nigeria and maintain exports of Nigerian grades to international markets. East of Suez markets dominate refinery capacity growth Refining developments East of Suez Regions East of Suez account for the vast majority of demand growth as well as refinery capacity growth through 2030. Consequently, the crude deficit East of Suez is expected to grow from 4.9 mb/d in 2023 to 7.7 mb/d by 2030. It will be met by increased supplies from the Atlantic Basin, including from Russia. In the face of OPEC+ production management the East of Suez is expected to see upstream output fall by 550 kb/d, with Middle East gains of 400 kb/d, driven largely by increased condensate production, more than offset by falling Asian Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 110 IEA.

Asia drives much of this increase, as its deficit rises by 2.3 mb/d, from 24.5 mb/d to 26.8 mb/d by 2030. Asian refinery throughputs are projected to increase by 1.4 mb/d, while regional upstream production falls by 900 kb/d through to 2030. Regional crude balances: Atlantic Basin surplus fills Asia’s crude deficit, 2019-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0 Middle East capacity additions slow by mid-decade Refining developments The Middle East stands as the leading exporter of crude oil and refined products, a trend that is expected to continue. Over the next seven years, refinery capacity will expand by 630 kb/d, accounting for 23% of total capacity additions East of Suez. Growth is driven by extensive construction and modernisation projects aimed at producing fuels that meet higher international standards. Refinery runs are projected to surge by 1.2 mb/d over the forecast period, with utilisation rates climbing by close to 6%, as recently added capacity becomes fully operational. Since 2022, the Middle East has added 1.5 mb/d of new capacity that is now nearing full utilisation. Coupled with voluntary OPEC+ production cuts, crude exports are projected to fall by around 300 kb/d over the 2023-2030 period. In 2024, the combined impact of higher runs and OPEC+ agreements and voluntary production cuts will reduce crude exports by 1.1 mb/d y-o-y, while refined product exports rise by over 550 kb/d. Nonetheless, the total balance of crude, condensate, NGLs and products is projected to grow by 1.4 mb/d by 2030, with 5.5 mb/d of refined products and 17.2 mb/d of crude exported. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 mb/d Atlantic Basin (ex-Russia) Russia Middle East Asian Crude Deficit Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 111 IEA.

The project aims to improve energy efficiency and produce cleaner products to meet stringent environmental standards, including enabling diesel to conform to ultra-low sulphur international specifications. Iran will boost its condensate refining by 180 kb/d, including 60 kb/d at the Siraf refinery and an additional 120 kb/d splitter at the Persian Gulf Star refinery by 2026. Iraq plans to expand its refining capacity by 320 kb/d, driven by government mandates to improve the quality of its refinery production and transition towards exporting refined products. This includes a 70 kb/d expansion at the Basra refinery in 2025 and the revival of a 150 kb/d CDU tower at Baiji in the north, which was damaged by the Islamic State in 2014, bringing its capacity back to 290 kb/d. Saudi Arabia's Jubail refinery will see a 20 kb/d expansion in 2024. However, the Yanbu crude to chemicals project, has stalled at the preliminary study phase and has been pushed out beyond this report’s forecast timeline. Despite crude and condensate exports falling from 18.5 mb/d in 2022, to 17.6 mb/d in 2023, and our expectation that they will decline to 17.2 mb/d by 2030, the Middle East remains the largest source of crude exports to fill the Asian deficit. China By 2030, Chinese refining capacity is expected to rise by 900 kb/d to 19 mb/d. However, crude runs are forecast to lag this increase, gaining just over 400 kb/d, as surging import volumes of petrochemical feedstocks bridge the gap versus forecast demand growth of 1.4 mb/d.

At the same time, a surplus of transport fuels, particularly for gasoline, will grow as EV market penetration increases in China and gasoline demand falls. Chinese capacity changes and demand for refined products, 2016-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The pace at which China is building refineries is slowing. Announced closures also weigh on capacity growth and from 2027 there are no major projects within our forecast. In our timeframe, the annual average net addition of around 130 kb/d is sharply lower than the 300 kb/d annual average witnessed over the past decade. Furthermore, the Chinese government has set a minimum size for new oil refineries and will ban small crude processors that claim to be speciality chemicals or bitumen producers under its plan to limit total capacity to 20 mb/d by 2025. China retains on paper a large swathe of spare capacity. Having averaged nearly 4 mb/d over the five years prior to Covid, spare capacity now stands at 3.5 mb/d as smaller refineries have been shut. We expect the level of spare capacity to remain close to current levels by 2030, leaving little room for additional projects. Independent refiners in the Shandong region are already feeling the pinch. Allocated crude import quotas are insufficient to meet the needs of all refiners, and this has left some unable to fully utilise their capacity. Moreover, as state-owned firms decrease their purchases of products from the independent refineries in Shandong, this further weighs on the run rates for the independent sector.

Additionally, Saudi Aramco and Norinco's integrated petrochemical facility in Panjin will add 320 kb/d of crude distillation and is set to come online in 2026, marking the last world-scale refinery before 2030. Expansion projects at existing refineries include Sinopec's Zhenhai refinery, which will expand by 260 kb/d to reach a capacity of 800 kb/d. CNOOC’s Daxie petrochemical refinery will expand by 120 kb/d to 260 kb/d, with a further 160 kb/d increase likely to be completed post-2030. Sinopec is also consolidating operations at two refineries in the Hunan province, merging its Changling and Yueyang plants and will reduce capacity by a net 100 kb/d to a combined 200 kb/d. This is part of an ongoing reform of state-owned assets to enhance efficiencies and increase petrochemical capacity through integrated refinery and petrochemical operations. China represents the lion’s share of Asia’s crude deficit, with a shortfall of 11.7 mb/d by 2030, an increase of almost 700 kb/d from 2023. However, India's import needs will grow by nearly 1 mb/d, from 4.6 mb/d to 5.6 mb/d, driven by aggressive refinery expansion programmes that add 1 mb/d in crude processing capacity. OECD Asia Oceania In OECD Asia Oceania, refinery activity is set to decline, with no new projects or expansions announced. The anticipated decrease in the region’s demand is poised to trigger further shutdowns, leading to a drop in throughput rates of around 200 kb/d over the forecast period.

CC BY 4.0. OECD Asia region will continue to be a net crude and product importer even as demand falls. This exacerbates the growing need for refined products across Asia. Notably, OECD Asia Oceania is expected to continue to need around 1.2 mb/d of refined product imports over the forecast period. Japan will see its demand for refined products decline by nearly 270 kb/d by 2030. Japanese refineries, primarily built for domestic fuel needs, struggle to compete internationally due to their lower scale and complexity compared to newer Asian refineries. This, coupled with the processing of lighter, more expensive crude oil and yielding lower-value products, puts them at a competitive disadvantage. The closure of the 120 kb/d Yamaguchi refinery in Q1 2024 brings the cumulative loss in capacity to 1.7 mb/d since 2006. This represents a cut of one-third of the industry’s peak almost 20 years ago. By contrast, Korea, with relatively stable demand and a refining industry deeply integrated with the domestic petrochemicals industry, stands as the only net exporting country in the region. However, it remains heavily reliant on imports of LPG, ethane and naphtha to fuel its petrochemical sector. Despite this, the overall surplus in refined products is expected to grow by 100 kb/d to reach more than 500 kb/d by 2030, alleviating the region's deficit in transportation fuels by nearly 300 kb/d. Indian refineries set for continued growth India's refining sector has established itself as a reliable global supplier of light and middle distillates while effectively meeting domestic demand. The forecast through to 2030 shows continued growth with several large-scale capacity expansions. Despite facing competition from the Middle East Gulf export refineries, Indian operators are gearing up to maintain their international product supply role, albeit with the challenge of decarbonising operations to reduce emissions. This requires substantial investment, including integrating low-carbon hydrogen and renewable energy sources. Macroeconomic and social drivers, along with initiatives, such as Make In India, are expected to propel demand growth for jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, and petrochemicals. However, government programmes such as the 20% ethanol blending mandate and the rise of electric vehicles may temper gasoline demand growth in the coming years, potentially increasing export volumes. Nevertheless, sustained GDP per capita growth and urbanisation are anticipated to drive robust increases in overall demand, ensuring continued vitality for India's refining industry. Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 115 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Indian refinery output and refined product demand, 2012-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0 India witnessed a remarkable surge in its refining capacity over the past few decades, with close to 3 mb/d in growth from 2006 to 2023. With a total refining capacity of 5.8 mb/d, India has firmly established itself as the fourth largest refiner worldwide. Recent expansions have been the result of investments in refining infrastructure as well as refiners' strategic pivot towards integrating petrochemicals. Currently, India has 23 operating refineries, with plans for further expansions, including one new greenfield project and multiple modernisation projects expected to add 1 mb/d of distillation capacity by 2030.

Despite these expansions, challenges persist, such as land acquisition which are creating hurdles to further growth. Completion of projects, such as the 1.2 mb/d Ratnagiri Refinery project, currently lies beyond the 2030 time frame, unless rapid progress can be made in reaching a final investment decision. Over the past decade, India has also emerged as the world's second-largest net crude oil importer, next to China, with average imports of 4.6 mb/d in 2023. We expect imports to increase by a further 1 mb/d by 2030. Despite India's strong export potential for light and middle distillates in the coming years, the country will face a growing shortfall in LPG supplies, as rising domestic demand for petrochemical feedstocks and the extension of the government’s clean cooking initiative boosts demand and requires increased imports. India’s refiners will be unable to adjust yields sufficiently to compensate. However, the availability of cheap ethane and propane from the United States and the Middle East presents an opportunity for India. Petrochemical capacity expansions are a recurring theme across the industry, highlighting the ongoing need for efficient and cost-effective feedstock supplies. Other Asia The remainder of Other Asia (Asia less India, China and OECD Asia Oceania) is expected to see growing dependence on product imports. Refining capacity will inch up by just 330 kb/d by 2030 to 7.5 mb/d, while refinery runs are projected to rise by 270 kb/d to 5.5 mb/d by 2030. Demand will grow by 1.4 mb/d to 10.2 mb/d, increasing the region’s reliance on imports. Consequently, the net crude import requirement deepens from 3.7 mb/d in 2023 to 4.4 mb/d by 2030. Efforts to expand and upgrade existing refineries to meet international fuel standards will provide some relief. Indonesia's Balikpapan refinery is set to increase its crude distillation capacity by 100 kb/d during 2025, while Thailand will complete its 125 kb/d Sriracha facility in 2026. Brunei's plans for Phase II at the Pulau Muara Besar refinery include a 55 kb/d expansion, expected to come online in 2029. Smaller upgrades in Mongolia and Viet Nam will add another 50 kb/d. Despite these improvements, Asian countries will continue to rely heavily on imports of gasoline, naphtha, ethane, and LPG due to population and economic growth, coupled with an expanding petrochemical industry.

Global product balances diverge as gasoline demand contracts, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. The most important shift at the product level will be the emergence of a gasoline market surplus. Despite the positive baseline revisions to gasoline demand in 2022 and 2023, and a stronger economic outlook in the short term, rising EV penetration and increased biofuels supply in the coming years tip the balance into heavy oversupply. To counter the impact of these changes we have assumed global average gasoline yields will decline 1.3% by the end of the decade. This potential surplus has important implications for the gasoline market’s ability to absorb naphtha supplies via blending and a knock-on impact on how fierce competition will be in the petrochemical feedstock market. Rising NGL production should ensure that the LPG market remains very well supplied and this will intensify competition with ex-refinery naphtha within the petrochemical feedstock market. However, the overall light ends balance is expected to improve by 2030 as the cumulative demand growth of 2.5 mb/d catches up with this supply growth. -1.8 -1.4 -1.0 -0.6 -0.2 0.2 0.6 1.0 1.4 1.8 2023-2030 mb/d Growth in demand for refined products Ethane LPG Naphtha Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel oil -1.8 -1.4 -1.0 -0.6 -0.2 0.2 0.6 1.0 1.4 1.8 2023-2030 mb/d Change in product balances Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 119 IEA.

While this may weigh on fuel oil cracks, in a world where heavy sour crude production remains constrained, we expect refineries to be willing buyers of heavy feedstocks that can be used to boost upgrading unit utilisation. In geographical terms, the United States and the Middle East will continue to dominate product export growth, much as it has done for the past 10 years. By contrast, Asia’s dependence on oil products is projected to increase by a cumulative 2.7 mb/d between 2023-2030. Americas product trade balances In the Atlantic Basin, the United States is expected to maintain its position as the largest net exporter of refined products, with Canada's surplus nearly offsetting Mexico's deficit. As a result, the change in North America’s trade balances will effectively be entirely driven by the United States. North American refined product balances, 2023-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. US oil products exports are forecast to grow by 1.3 mb/d to 5 mb/d, primarily due to declining demand eclipsing reduced refinery runs. The growth in refined product exports is also propelled by the rise in NGL output, boosting exports of LPG, ethane, and naphtha by approximately 500 kb/d. The increase in LPG flows will help to meet the growing import requirements seen in China and India due to the expansion of the petrochemical industry and the latter nation’s clean cooking initiative. The surplus in gasoline stemming from the decline in demand contributes around 600 kb/d. Similarly, North American exports of diesel are forecast to increase by nearly 500 kb/d over the next seven years, driven by the United States.

CC BY 4.0. structural net import position of Europe, especially in the absence of Russian supplies, US exports will likely find healthy demand against the backdrop of a supportive global balance. Conversely, gasoline exports are expected to face tougher competition in the Atlantic Basin. Rising Mexican domestic supplies following the start of the Dos Bocas refinery will cut import needs. Similarly, Latin American gasoline imports are expected to diminish slightly by the end of the decade, as are West African needs, once Nigeria’s Dangote refinery is fully operational. With US domestic demand for refined gasoline expected to fall by a cumulative 1.6 mb/d over the 2023-2030 time frame, we think that US refineries, even as they enact a 3% yield shift in favour of diesel, will still have an additional 600 kb/d of gasoline exports by 2030, assuming that runs are 900 kb/d lower by then. Europe product trade balances European refined product import requirements are forecast to remain at around 1.1 mb/d on average over the rest of the decade. In part, this reflects the assumption that refinery activity declines keep pace with the decrease in demand, resulting in relatively stable imports. The largest change to regional refined product balances is driven by the rapid contraction in European diesel demand, which drops by 1 mb/d. Lower crude runs drive the reduction in Europe’s diesel output, but this is outpaced by the demand contraction. European diesel imports by source, 2017-2024 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Source: IEA analysis based on data from Kpler. Consequently, we expect net diesel imports to decline by 580 kb/d, to around 700 kb/d by 2030.

Middle East product trade balances Refined products balances East of Suez will be driven by increased Middle East refining activity and Asia’s burgeoning net product import needs. The Middle East serves as the world’s largest product exporting hub and is expected to remain so through to 2030. Refined product exports will surge by 1.7 mb/d over the forecast period, pushing the surplus available to export up to 5.8 mb/d. Rising NGL production should boost the LPG exports by 500 kb/d by 2030. Similarly, the full impact of recent refining additions will increase supplies of naphtha, jet fuel and diesel. In contrast to other regions, these additions will also lift exports of fuel oil, as will Saudi Arabia’s shift away from fuel oil in power generation. Asia product trade balances Asia remains a net importer of both crude and products, although Korea and Brunei are both net product exporters. Asia’s resilient economic growth and rising demand point to substantial increases in imports. Light and middle distillates make up the bulk of the import requirements and we expect volumes to grow by a combined total of nearly 1 mb/d. LPG and ethane import needs will also increase, deepening regional dependence on volumes from the Middle East and North America by more than 800 kb/d by the end of the decade. India is forecast to remain a net exporter of middle distillates throughout the forecast period, as rising refining activity keeps pace with increases of 500 kb/d in diesel and 100 kb/d in jet fuel demand. However, stronger demand growth forecasts for gasoline (+170 kb/d in 2023-2030) and LPG are likely to push the country into net product importer status by 2030. Petrochemical sector expansions as well as the ongoing expansion of the clean cooking initiative lift LPG demand. Despite aggressive steps taken by the refining industry in terms of capacity additions and infrastructure development, it is likely to fail to match the rapid growth in demand over the forecast period. For India to sustain its net product exporter status, growth in refining capacity needs to accelerate beyond the 1 mb/d contained in our forecast to meet its demand growth of 1.2 mb/d. LPG export length from the United States and Middle East, will make up for the shortfall in Asia. China is set to remain the largest refiner globally, but the continued need to import petrochemical feedstocks, namely LPG, ethane, and naphtha, weigh on the overall product trade balance. Middle distillate exports contract marginally by the end of the decade, while exports of gasoline are expected to grow by 570 kb/d, to Oil 2024 Refining and trade PAGE | 123 IEA. CC BY 4.0. roughly 700 kb/d by 2030. However, imports requirements of naphtha, LPG and ethane could increase by 900 kb/d to 2.5 mb/d Against the backdrop of a tight middle distillate market, the loss of Chinese export volumes will push Asian markets to bid for additional middle distillate exports from the Middle East and the Atlantic Basin. Conversely, the prospect of an oversupplied gasoline market could make the increase in gasoline export potentially problematic. Consequently, we see the potential for further yield shifts by Chinese refineries to more closely align output with the domestic petrochemical industry’s feedstock requirements. This could boost naphtha and jet fuel yields at the expense of gasoline and diesel yields, respectively. Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 124 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Natural Gas Liquids Global summary Sustained growth ahead for ethane and LPG markets Global NGLs production is on track to rise by 1.9 mb/d in the 2023-2030 outlook period as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane markets continue to expand. LPG growth is driven by stronger demand in petrochemicals and clean cooking while ethane is supported by rising petrochemical industries in countries that produce it as well as importers seeking low-cost feedstocks, particularly China. Over the previous decade, NGLs output rose by 50% to 12.7 mb/d in 2023 but growth will slow to 1.9% per year through 2030, reaching 14.6 mb/d. From 2023 to 2030, overall ethane production rises 825 kb/d, with the Middle East and United States accounting for almost 90% of growth. With ethane trade expected to expand by nearly 20% by 2030, incremental shipping and terminal capacity will be needed. LPG demand grows by 1.7 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, mainly in markets East of Suez, while supply increases by a smaller 1.3 mb/d, of which just over 60% is from East of Suez markets. NGLs – the fastest growing segment of fossil liquids production Natural gas liquids accompany gas production, either from dedicated gas wells (in which liquids are present in a gaseous phase) or as associated gas from liquids producing wells (crude or condensate). In the decade to 2023, the share of NGLs in overall fossil liquids production has risen from 10% to just over 13%. The steady progression reflects shifts in the weighting of crude production to regions with lighter and gassier qualities, such as US shale oil production, as well as the growing market for natural gas, much of which has been met by the expansion of shale gas production in North America that is typically richer in gas liquids. Natural gas at the wellhead consists of methane and numerous smaller fractions of heavier hydrocarbons and other components. These include ethane, propane, normal butane and isobutane, natural gasoline (C5+), acid gases (such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide or mercaptans), other gases (nitrogen and helium) as well as water. Before entering a distribution pipeline or a liquefaction facility, raw natural gas must be processed to meet the desired specifications by extracting components such as NGLs and other pollutants. These specifications may also require calibration of the pipeline gas to a specific calorific value (megajoule (MJ) Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 125 IEA. CC BY 4.0. per standard cubic metre). Sweetening/acid removal processes eliminates the acid gases. Marketable gas typically only has a few percent of NGLs and other gases. Beyond meeting appropriate market specifications for natural gas, these liquids have their own values in separate markets which are generally much higher than the value of their energy (MJ) content. However, ethane is frequently returned to the gas stream when its market value falls below its Btu value in the natural gas pool. This may reflect a surplus of supply versus demand for ethane-based petrochemical feedstocks, where that exists, or an absence of any demand. Due to disparities in densities between the different molecules that make up the pool of NGLs, supply and demand estimated in volume differs from that in tonnes or terajoules (TJ). Typical gas processing plant flow Source: Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 3.0, as modified by the IEA. Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 126 IEA. CC BY 4.0. At a global level, around 0.11 TJ of NGLs are produced for every TJ of natural gas marketed, up from 0.09 a decade ago. This outlook sees a steady increase of that ratio to 0.125 in 2030 (versus the WEO STEPS outlook for natural gas production). More NGLs extraction reflects greater efforts to capture the value of these liquids as well as increases in the liquids-rich share of gas production. The elimination of gas flaring should also favour higher NGLs output, whether the methane goes to a gas market or is reinjected to maintain well pressure. This ratio of NGLs to natural gas production varies from country to country. In low ratio cases, the gas may be very dry, with only a small cut of liquids in the wet gas at the wellhead. It may also reflect low or no extraction of ethane in the NGL mix in the absence of access to buyers or markets. An above average ratio appears in countries having a high proportion of liquids in gas at the wellhead. It also reflects associated gas producers where the dry gas (after removing NGLs) is reinjected in the oil well (to maintain well pressure) or is flared (having no market or use). Good examples of countries with such high ratios include Saudi Arabia (0.48), the UAE (0.39), Kuwait (0.36) and Iraq (0.51). Global NGL production was 12.7 mb/d in 2023, or roughly 13% of overall fossil liquids production on a volume basis. Over the past decade output has risen by 50% from 8.5 mb/d in 2013. We forecast growth to slow to 1.9% per year from 2023, pushing NGL supply to 14.6 mb/d in 2030. Nevertheless, the share of NGLs in production continues to rise, reaching 14.5% in 2030. At the same time, growth in crude and condensate output slows to 0.3% per year, declining slightly by 2030. Three countries account for 70% of NGL output and its growth. The United States is the largest producer at 6.4 mb/d in 2023, or 50% of the global total, and similarly leads growth through 2030, to reach 7.3 mb/d. Saudi Arabia produces 1.4 mb/d of NGLs, or 11% of the global total, but will account for over 30% of growth in the coming years and reach 1.9 mb/d, or 13% of global supply. This reflects the development of the Jafurah gas field that is expected to start production in 2025. Canadian NGL production will rise from 1.1 mb/d in 2023 (8% of global supply) to 1.3 mb/d in 2030. Of the remaining 30% of global supply, production in the UAE rises from 550 kb/d in 2023 (4.3% of world) to 615 kb/d in 2030. Output remains flat for Iran at around 500 kb/d (3.5%) while Qatar increases from 360 kb/d in 2023 (3%) to 610 kb/d in 2030 (4%). Another 10% of production is spread amongst a smattering of producers amounting to 1-2% each for Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Iraq, Kuwait, Mexico, Norway, and Thailand.

Ethane markets China, the United States and Saudi Arabia drive petrochemical feedstock growth Ethane generally holds a superior valuation relative the natural gas stream from which it is extracted. Without that, there is no reason to extract the ethane. Global trade today comprises just one major exporter (the United States) and a few major importers including China, India and Northwest Europe, while Canada imports ethane by pipeline from the US Northeast. National data on ethane production and use is not always reliable. Trade data and ethane demand (based on the existence of ethane-based steam crackers as used in the demand section of this report) help to assess the actual production and use for each country. In some cases, it may well overlook ethane/propane mixtures for the petrochemical sector (typically 10-20% ethane) where crackers have the necessary degree of flexibility, though this may not be public information. Ethane demand and supply rise in parallel by 800 kb/d from 2023 to 2030. Demand is dominated by a handful of countries where new ethane-based steam cracker capacity is coming online. The United States and Canada are major consumers, reflecting low-cost production stripped from ample wet shale output and sold to local petrochemical businesses. Canadian ethane demand rises from 245 kb/d in 2023 to 305 kb/d in 2030 (+60 kb/d) while US demand increases by 290 kb/d to 2.4 mb/d. Mexican ethane use (85 kb/d) remains stable and is currently met from local supply, but future imports may be required as domestic NGL production will fall by 60 kb/d over the forecast period. In Latin America, both Brazil (37 kb/d) and Argentina (30 kb/d) use local ethane supply. In Europe, ethane use began in the United Kingdom and Norway but has broadened to include Sweden and Belgium on the availability of competitive export volumes from North America. The United Kingdom consumes 35 kb/d, of which 30 kb/d is from imports and Sweden uses 10 kb/d which is entirely from imports. Norway consumes 45-50 kb/d, from imports since 2022 as local production has been reinjected into the natural gas stream where it gains a higher value on an energy basis in the European market. Imports to Belgium rise later this decade to 48 kb/d following investments to increase petrochemical feedstock flexibility. The Middle East uses substantial volumes of ethane and exports none. Saudi Arabia accounts for around half of these volumes (550 kb/d in 2023) while Qatar (145 kb/d) and the UAE (185 kb/d) make up most of the rest. Availability of low-cost feedstocks (ethane and LPG) has driven expansion of the petrochemical industry in all these countries. Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 128 IEA. CC BY 4.0. Chinese demand rises from 225 kb/d in 2023 to 280 kb/d in 2030, fed mainly by US exports. Indian demand is stable at around 140 kb/d, with roughly half met by imports. Other Asian countries using ethane are Thailand (63 kb/d), Malaysia (34 kb/d) and Australia (10 kb/d). In Africa, Egypt (20 kb/d) and Nigeria (10 kb/d) also use ethane, as does Russia (50 kb/d), Turkmenistan (16 kb/d) and Uzbekistan (17 kb/d). From 2023 to 2030, overall ethane production rises 825 kb/d. Some 350 kb/d of growth stems from the Middle East (170 kb/d in Saudi Arabia, 100 kb/d in Qatar, 45 kb/d in the UAE and 30 kb/d in Iran), about 380 kb/d from the United States and around 60 kb/d in Canada. Local supply meets demand growth in the Middle East, Latin America, the FSU and North America while higher seaborne exports from the United States meet evolving feedstock requirements elsewhere, driving an increase in trade. Ethane demand and trade, 2012-2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0. US producers generate a substantial surplus that has been exported to international markets since 2014. EU crackers initially purchased US ethane exports, but rising volumes have attracted buyers in China and India. While exports could be higher in the future, slower expansion in Chinese and Indian ethane-based cracker capacity will limit US exports to around 565 kb/d at the end of the decade (versus 470 kb/d in 2023). 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 mb/d Ethane Demand US Middle East China India Canada Others 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 - 600 - 500 - 400 - 300 - 200 - 100 0 kb/d Global Ethane Trade Europe India China Canada Others US (RHS) Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 129 IEA. CC BY 4.0. LPG markets Supply lags demand growth by the end of the decade The rapid expansion of NGL supply in recent years has boosted liquefied petroleum gases availability, driving down its price as demand struggled to keep pace. Around 40% of LPG comes from refineries and the rest from NGL fractionation. Relatively low prices for LPG has created new markets in petrochemicals, transportation fuels, heating and for cooking applications. The demand section of this report details some of these trends, notably for petrochemicals. Slightly less than one-third of all LPG supply globally goes to non-energy uses as feedstocks for petrochemicals and just over 45% to residential heating and cooking uses. Industry takes another 9%, road transport burns 7% and agriculture 6% (mainly for drying crops). This analysis considers overall LPG balances. But liquified petroleum gases combine propane, normal butane (n-butane) and isobutane. Beyond use in heating or as transport fuels, each molecule has specific applications in petrochemicals and refining. Isobutane has an octane number of 100 and serves as a gasoline octane enhancer, but also as a refrigerant and propellent. Gasoline blenders and refiners use a few percent of low-cost n-butane to boost gasoline volatility to improve ignition during cold weather. Butanes are also used in the manufacture of MTBE, a key gasoline octane enhancer outside the United States and Europe. Butylene used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber also require butanes. Propane finds outlets as a petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene and propylene. Overall LPG demand will grow by 1.7 mb/d between 2023 and 2030, two-thirds of which in markets East of Suez. China accounts for 35% of global demand growth (versus a market share of 23% today) and while the Middle East represents 8% (versus 7%). Development of the petrochemical industry drives most of this growth, but use in road transport, heating and cooking also increases. The latter boosts African and Indian demand, which together account for 24% of global LPG growth through 2030 as compared to a market share of just 13% in 2023. On the other hand, growth lags market shares for North America (10% of growth versus 16% of market share), Europe (1.6% versus 10%) and Latin America (1.5% versus 5%) where stagnant or declining use in transportation, heating and cooking leaves petrochemicals as the driver of moderate expansion. Refinery output of marketable LPG (after refinery use in gasoline blending) grows by 500 kb/d to 4.9 mb/d in 2030. Due to the continued development of refinery capacity in the Middle East and Asia, countries East of Suez account for almost all that increase (China 38%, India 9% and the Middle East as a whole 28%). The contribution to overall LPG supply growth from refineries slightly lags its share in Oil 2024 Natural Gas Liquids PAGE | 130 IEA. CC BY 4.0. overall supply (37% versus 39%) but is central to meeting the development of regional Asian demand. Refinery output of LPG in the Atlantic Basin stagnates as expected refinery closures in Europe offset output from new capacity elsewhere. Fractionator, or upstream, supply of LPG accounts for the bulk of growth to 2030, rising 850 kb/d to 7.7 mb/d. Growth comes mainly from Canada (+140 kb/d), Qatar (+120 kb/d), Saudi Arabia (+320 kb/d) and the United States (+420 kb/d). Minor gains elsewhere (such as Argentina, Iraq and the UAE) are insufficient to offset declines (as in India, Mexico, North Sea or Thailand) resulting in an overall decline of 185 kb/d outside the four key producers. LPG supply increases overall by 1.3 mb/d, of which 510 kb/d in the Atlantic Basin and 830 kb/d East of Suez (reflecting the substantial contribution of refining in Asia and the Middle East). Gains of 600 kb/d across the United States and Canada, and more marginally Latin America, are offset by net losses elsewhere in the Atlantic Basin, most notably 95 kb/d in Europe. Increases East of Suez are dominated by the Middle East (+650 kb/d) as well as China (+185 kb/d) and India (+25 kb/d). The Middle East accounts for 49% of global gains in LPG production, a disproportionate share versus its 17% contribution to supply today. Incremental supply from the United States and Canada combined (42% of global supply growth) are also slightly ahead of their market share (39%), highlighting the continued key role in meeting overall demand. The combined production surplus of the United States and Canada rises steadily from 2.7 mb/d in 2023 to 3.1 mb/d in 2030 as continued growth in production outstrips demand gains centred on the petrochemical industry. However, the Atlantic Basin deficit outside these two exporters increases from 1.3 mb/d in 2023 to 1.7 mb/d in 2030. Deficits increase in Africa (+220 kb/d), Europe (+110 kb/d) and Mexico (+60 kb/d).

The 520 kb/d of increase in the Middle East surplus by 2030 only offsets part of Asia’s widening deficit (from 2.2 mb/d to 2.9 mb/d). China’s deficit alone rises by 400 kb/d while that of India increases by 150 kb/d. The need for Atlantic Basin flows to balance the region persists. These LPG exports to East of Suez will rise from 1.4 mb/d in 2023 to 1.6 mb/d in 2025 before easing through the end of the decade. Shipping and terminal capacity will have to adapt. C5+ from fractionation A substantial uplift to global naphtha supply The last cut from fractionation of NGLs is the heavier C5+ molecules. On a global average basis, they represent around 18% of yields by weight but 12.5% of volume yields (ethane 34% and LPG 54% by volume). However, the substantial increase in C5+ production from NGL fractionation over 2023-2030 (+12%) boosts growth in naphtha supply by 200 kb/d to 785 kb/d over the period, including refinery output. This surge in C5+ supply comes from the United States (+100 kb/d) and Canada (+30 kb/d) as well as from the Middle East (+120 kb/d) while the net change in supply from the rest of the world is negative. While much of the C5+ finds its way to the naphtha pool, some of it is used as diluent for heavy crudes as well as for blending in gasoline (hence the term “natural gasoline” for this fractionation cut).

Biofuels Government policies support biofuels growth Biofuels demand is set to rise by 600 kb/d to 3.7 mb/d by 2030, but growth slows in the latter half of the forecast period. Government policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing oil imports and supporting domestic agriculture drive the majority of this growth. However, in North America and Europe electric vehicle uptake and efficiency improvements reduce total road transport fuel demand thus slowing the potential increase for biofuels. In Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions growth remains robust, further strengthening biofuel fuel demand for road transport. Overall, biodiesel and renewable diesel account for 42% (260 kb/d), ethanol for 35% (210 kb/d), and biojet fuel 23% (140 kb/d) of the increase from 2023 and 2030. Biofuel demand and growth by fuel and region, 2023 to 2030 IEA. CC BY 4.0 Note: Share of transport demand is based on the volume share of ethanol in motor gasoline, biodiesel and renewable diesel in diesel and biojet in jet kerosene in 2023 and 2030. Ethanol demand rises to 2.1 mb/d by 2030, reaching 8% of motor gasoline consumption compared with 7% in 2023. Brazil’s Fuel of the Future programme, which plans to increase the mandated ethanol blending share from 27% to a maximum of 30%, combines with higher RenovaBio Greenhouse Gas (GHG) targets and increased motor gasoline demand to account for most of this growth. In the Asia Pacific region, India’s pursuit of its 20% ethanol blending target along with higher motor fuel demand will provide for most of the gains. By contrast, North America ethanol demand is forecast to fall by 10% between 2023 and 2030, in line with an anticipated 18% decline in motor gasoline consumption.

CC BY 4.0. demand is partially offset by small increases in ethanol blending shares in the United States, new alcohol-to-jet capacity, and rising ethanol use in Canada to meet provincial policies and the national Clean Fuel Regulations. In Europe, a 13% decline in motor gasoline demand over the forecast slows ethanol growth to near zero, despite the EU’s new Renewable Energy Directive target of 29% renewable energy in transport fuels by 2030. Biodiesel and renewable diesel demand increase to 1.4 mb/d, or 7% of diesel consumption by 2030. Biodiesel demand expands the most in Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia thanks to growing fuel use and planned increases to blending targets. Renewable diesel (HVO) expands quickest in North America and Europe despite declining diesel use in both regions. In North America, the US renewable fuels standard, Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits and state level policies drive demand, while in Canada uptake is driven by the national Clean Fuel Regulations and provincial policies. In Europe, the state level transposition of the EU’s RED III and the Renewable Fuel Transport Obligation in the UK drive consumption. Biojet demand rises to 150 kb/d by 2030 Demand growth for biojet is driven primarily by policies in the United States, Europe and Japan. In Europe, the EU’s ReFuelEU targets 6% sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2030 with a 1.2% sub-target for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO). The UK is also planning to introduce a 10% SAF target by 2030, while Japan is aiming for 10% SAF by 2030. There remains considerable upside potential in the United States as well depending on future increases to the renewable fuel standards (RFS) and extension of IRA credits as well as proposed changes to state level policies such as California’s low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Brazil, Singapore, India, the UAE and Indonesia are also considering new biojet policies. Globally, announced biojet projects reach a capacity of 600 kb/d by 2030 (8% of jet fuel demand), but not all will be built, and more policies will need to be implemented to enable investment in new facilities. Ethanol feedstock demand remains steady Crops supported 88% of biofuel production in 2023 and this share is forecast to decrease slightly to 85% by 2030. The share of crops supporting ethanol production remains steady between 2023 and 2030, with near 18% of global sugar production and 6% of global starch supply used for fuels. By contrast, the share of vegetable oils used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel and biojet is expected to increase from 18% in 2023 to 25% of global production by 2030. Similarly, residue oils such as used cooking oil and animal fats climb from 50% of estimated collectible supply to 80% by 2030. Use of “other” feedstocks, such as agricultural and forestry residues and municipal solid waste, more than double to 2030, but only account for 3% of biofuel production globally.

Notes: Sugars include sugar cane and sugar beets; starches include maize, wheat, rice and other coarse grains; vegetable oils include soybean oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil and other vegetable oils; and residue oils include used cooking oil, animal fats, palm oil mill effluent and other residue oils. All other, “other” category includes non-crop feedstocks such as agricultural residues, forestry residues and municipal solid waste. Shares for sugars, starches and vegetable oils are based on biofuel feedstock demand in this forecast divided by global production estimates from OECD/FAO (2023), Agricultural Outlook 2023-2032. Residue oil share is based on total collectible supplies of 37 Mt/yr based on 2020 World Economic Forum, Clean Skies for Tomorrow: Sustainable Aviation Fuels as a Pathway to Net-Zero Aviation estimates. Sugar demand for ethanol production, mostly sugar cane, expands 13% by 2030, primarily in Brazil and India to meet growing ethanol demand. Maize use also rises in Brazil for ethanol production. Growing demand for starches is partially offset by declining consumption in the United States due to lower ethanol use. Vegetable oil demand expands by nearly 50%, led by the United States, Canada, Brazil and Indonesia. In the United States and Canada, demand is driven by renewable diesel and biojet expansion, while in Brazil and Indonesia biodiesel use expands. Residue oil demand increases by over 50%, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe thanks to policies that reward lower GHG intensities or otherwise provide additional value for residues over crops. Demand rises in Singapore as well to support renewable diesel and biojet production, primarily destined for export to Europe and North America. Other feedstocks, including agricultural and forestry residues and municipal solid waste and ethanol for biojet more than double to 2030. Cellulosic ethanol accounts for the non-crop growth primarily in Brazil and India. Total capacity for cellulosic ethanol facilities expands to 15 kb/d by 2030.

      "    \"content\": \"LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2025, saying air and road travel would support consumption and potential trade tariffs were not expected to impact economic growth.\\n\\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a monthly report, said world oil demand will rise by 1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and by 1.43 million bpd in 2026. Both forecasts were unchanged from last month. [...] The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\nOPEC's view on oil demand is at the higher end of industry forecasts and it expects oil use to keep rising in coming years, unlike the International Energy Agency which see demand peaking this decade as the world switches to cleaner fuels. [...] The IEA sees 2025 demand growth at 1.05 million bpd, lower than OPEC, although the gap between the two on 2025 is much smaller than it was for 2024 when the split reached a record high driven by differences over the pace of the energy transition.\\n\\nOPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies such as Russia, has implemented a series of output cuts since late 2022 to support the market. Its current plan calls for oil output to be gradually increased from April.\",\n",

Both forecasts were unchanged from last month.\\n\\nThe Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up [here.](https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/reuters-tariff-watch/?location=article-paragraph)\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\nOPEC's view on oil demand is at the higher end of industry forecasts and it expects oil use to [keep rising](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/opec-takes-long-term-view-global-oil-markets-aims-stability-2025-02-11/) in coming years, unlike the International Energy Agency which see demand peaking this decade as the world switches to cleaner fuels.\\n\\nIn the report, OPEC said the trade policy of President Donald Trump's new U.S. administration has added more uncertainty into markets, potentially creating supply-demand imbalances that are not reflective of market fundamentals, but it made no change to its 2025 economic growth forecast.\\n\\n\\\"It remains to be seen how and to what extent potential tariffs and other policy measures will play out,\\\" OPEC said in the report. \\\"So far, they are not anticipated to materially impact the current underlying growth assumptions.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\n\\nOil was steady after the OPEC report was released with Brent crude trading lower towards $76 a barrel.\\n\\nThe IEA sees 2025 demand growth at 1.05 million bpd, lower than OPEC, although the gap between the two on 2025 is much smaller than it was for 2024 when the split reached a record high driven by differences over the pace of the energy transition.\\n\\nOPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies such as Russia, has implemented a series of output cuts since late 2022 to support the market. Its [current plan](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/opec-takes-long-term-view-global-oil-markets-aims-stability-2025-02-11/) calls for oil output to be gradually increased from April.\\n\\nReporting by Alex Lawler;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle Editing by Tomasz Janowski\\n\\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\\n\\n*   Suggested Topics:\\n*   [Energy](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/)\\n*   [OPEC](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec/)\\n*   [Transport Fuels](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/transport-fuels/)\\n\\n*    \\n*    \\n*    \\n*    \\n*    \\n\\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\\n\\nRead Next\\n---------\\n\\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-ease-surprise-builds-us-inventories-2025-05-22/)[Energy category](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/)[Oil prices fall more than 1% on OPEC+ output hike discussion](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-ease-surprise-builds-us-inventories-2025-05-22/)   \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/indias-reliance-start-solar-module-factory-this-year-exec-says-2025-05-22/)[Sustainability category](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/)[India's Reliance to start solar module factory this year, exec says](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/indias-reliance-start-solar-module-factory-this-year-exec-says-2025-05-22/)   \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/activist-elliott-poised-win-two-board-seats-phillips-66-source-says-2025-05-21/)[Energy category](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/)[Elliott wins two seats, Phillips 66 retains two seats in hotly contested board fight](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/activist-elliott-poised-win-two-board-seats-phillips-66-source-says-2025-05-21/)   \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-crude-gasoline-distillate-inventories-rise-eia-2025-05-21/)[Energy category](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/)[US crude, fuel stocks up as crude imports rise, product demand slips, EIA says](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-crude-gasoline-distillate-inventories-rise-eia-2025-05-21/)   \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/group-that-blocked-new-mexico-utility-merger-eyes-data-centers-blackstone-deal-2025-05-21/)[Sustainability category](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/)[Group that blocked New Mexico utility merger eyes data centers in Blackstone deal](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/group-that-blocked-new-mexico-utility-merger-eyes-data-centers-blackstone-deal-2025-05-21/)   \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nigerias-dangote-refinery-agrees-export-polypropylene-with-vinmar-2025-05-22/)[Energy category](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/)[Nigeria's Dangote refinery agrees to export polypropylene with Vinmar](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nigerias-dangote-refinery-agrees-export-polypropylene-with-vinmar-2025-05-22/)   \\n\\n[](https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/products/workspace?utm_source=reuters.com&utm_medium=articlebanner&utm_campaign=Reuters_ProductPage_Links)\\n\\n[Markets](https://www.reuters.com/markets/)\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-trading-day-graphic-pix-2025-05-21/) ### [Trading Day: Bond alarms ring louder](https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-trading-day-graphic-pix-2025-05-21/)\\n\\n[Rates & Bonds category](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/) · May 21, 2025\\nMaking sense of the forces driving global markets  \\n*   [](https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-05-20/) [Stocks category](https://www.reuters.com/markets/stocks/)[Stocks dip, Treasury yields gain;

Finally, oil demand growth will remain robust in Africa and Latin [...] 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 2019 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 \\n\\nOECD DEMAND \\n\\nAmericas 25.4 25.4 25.9 25.7 25.6 25.1 25.4 26.2 25.9 25.7 25.8 25.8 25.9 25.8 25.7 \\n\\nEurope 13.9 14.1 14.6 14.0 14.1 13.7 13.7 14.4 13.9 13.9 14.0 14.1 14.0 14.0 14.0 \\n\\nAsia Oceania 8.3 7.5 7.6 8.1 7.9 8.1 7.2 7.6 8.1 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 \\n\\nTotal OECD 47.6 47.0 48.1 47.7 47.6 46.9 46.4 48.3 47.9 47.4 47.7 47.8 47.9 47.8 47.7 \\n\\nNON-OECD DEMAND\",\n",

All rights reserved.\\n\\n# Executive summary \\n\\n# Coronavirus clouds oil outlook \\n\\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has added a major layer of uncertainty to the oil market outlook at the start of the forecast period covered by this report. In 2020, global oil demand is expected to contract for the first time since the global recession of 2009. The situation remains very fluid, however, making it extremely difficult to assess the full impact of the virus. \\n\\nTo construct a base case for oil demand in 2020, this report draws on a wide range of data sources, including initial data for transport fuel demand, the most affected sector, and recently revised global GDP estimates by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In this base case, we assume that although the virus is brought under control in China by the end of the first quarter, the number of cases rises in many other countries. Containment measures imposed in North America, Europe and elsewhere are expected to have a smaller impact on oil demand than those in China. However, demand from the aviation sector will continue to suffer from the contraction in global air travel. \\n\\nIn this case, oil demand in China suffers the most in the first quarter, with a year-on-year fall of 1.8 million barrels per day (mb/d). Global demand drops by 2.5 mb/d. In the second quarter, an improving situation in China offsets deteriorating demand elsewhere. A progressive recovery takes place through the second half of 2020. For 2020 as a whole, the magnitude of the drop in the first half leads to a decline in global oil demand of around 90,000 barrels a day compared with 2019. \\n\\nUltimately, the outlook for the oil market will depend on how quickly governments move to contain the coronavirus outbreak, how successful their efforts are, and what lingering impact the global health crisis has on economic activity. At the time of publication, the high uncertainty over the course of the global epidemic has led us to propose two alternatives to our base case for demand in 2020: a more pessimistic one in which global measures are less successful in containing the virus, and an optimistic case in which it is contained quickly. \\n\\nThese alternatives are outlined in the March edition of the IEA’s monthly Oil Market Report, which is released in tandem with this medium-term report .\\n\\n# Markets face major challenges \\n\\nThe arrival of the coronavirus is rattling a global oil market that was already facing challenges. On the demand side, growth in 2019 was significantly weaker than expected and new vehicle efficiency measures have started to weigh on transport fuels. Refining capacity additions in recent years have outstripped demand growth, bringing tough competition for an industry already challenged by tightening product specifications, most notably the new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) bunker rules introduced at the beginning of 2020. \\n\\nOn the supply side, geopolitics remain a wild card. Production losses from Iran, Libya and Venezuela have reached a combined 3.5 mb/d since the start of 2018. Even before the Market Report OIL 2020 Executive summary   \\n\\n> PAGE |8\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\ncoronavirus, markets had been over-supplied, leading OPEC+ producers to cut output. Looking beyond the short term, the oil market looks comfortably supplied through 2025. \\n\\nFollowing a contraction in 2020 and an expected sharp rebound in 2021, global oil demand growth is set to weaken as consumption of transport fuels increases more slowly. Between 2019 and 2025, global oil demand is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of just below 1 mb/d. Petrochemicals become an ever more important driver, with naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane responsible for half of all growth. Efforts to improve the sustainability of the plastics industry will run up against the steady increase in demand from consumers in developing countries. Bans imposed on single-use plastics and recycling, even if fully implemented, will displace only a very modest amount of oil demand. Through 2025, global oil demand rises by a total of 5.7 mb/d, with China and India accounting for about half of growth. \\n\\nAt the same time, the world’s oil production capacity is expected to rise by 5.9 mb/d. Non-OPEC supply will rise by 4.5 mb/d while OPEC builds another 1.4 mb/d of crude and natural gas liquids capacity. This assumes that there is no change to sanctions on Iran or Venezuela. The United States leads the way as the largest source of new supply. Given its huge resource potential, it could produce even more if prices end up higher than assumed in this report. Brazil, Guyana, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates also deliver impressive gains. \\n\\nStrong growth in Asian oil demand is creating major opportunities for oil producing countries that can boost exports. But growth in non-OPEC production is set to lose momentum after a few years, indicating a greater role for OPEC+ countries. The pace of expansion in the United States is slowing as independent producers cut spending and scale back drilling activity in response to pressure from investors. The deceleration in US and other non-OPEC growth from 2022 will allow OPEC producers from the Middle East to turn up the taps to help keep the oil market in balance, thereby increasing their importance for oil consuming countries. \\n\\n# Oil and clean energy transitions \\n\\nGlobal attention is increasingly focused on the need to accelerate clean energy transitions in order to mitigate the risks of climate change. With its major emissions footprint, the energy sector – including the oil and gas industry – is at the heart of the matter. Demand growth for gasoline and diesel between 2019 and 2025 is set to weaken as countries around the world implement policies to improve efficiency and cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and as electric vehicles increase in popularity. Refiners, nevertheless, continue to build much more capacity than what is needed to meet product demand. \\n\\nThe impact of clean energy transitions on oil supply remains unclear, with many companies prioritising short-cycle projects for the coming years. To date, announcements by major oil companies on reducing their CO2 emissions have tended to focus on long-term objectives. Nevertheless, investors continue to ratchet up pressure on the industry to sharpen its focus on sustainability issues while activists, especially in Europe and North America, seek to hinder new oil developments. \\n\\nWith uncertainties over demand, supply, investment strategies and business models, the global oil industry faces major challenges. While ensuring it is able to continue to meet growing demand, it must also address the need to curb emissions and improve sustainability. Oil Market Report 2020 Demand   \\n\\n> PAGE |9\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\n# 1. Demand \\n\\n# Highlights \\n\\n• Global oil demand will grow by 5.7 mb/d over the 2019-25 period at an average annual rate of 950 kb/d. This is a sharp reduction on the 1.5 mb/d annual pace seen in the previous 10-year period. Following a difficult start in 2020 (-90 kb/d) due to the coronavirus, growth rebounds to 2.1 mb/d in 2021 and decelerates to 800 kb/d by 2025 as transport fuels demand growth stagnates. \\n\\n• Gasoline demand will grow the least over the forecast period, by just 90 kb/d per year. Consumption growth is expected to slow to 50 kb/d at the end of the forecast period, due to improved car efficiency standards and the increased penetration of electric vehicles. \\n\\n• Diesel consumption will grow by 110 kb/d on average and growth will decelerate to a very limited level by 2025. All in all, progress in vehicle efficiency will be the main factor impacting diesel demand in the medium term. \\n\\n• Petrochemical feedstocks naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ethane will be responsible for half of oil products demand growth, or roughly 0.5 mb/d per year as demand for other fuels stagnates. Feedstock demand grows in line with the consumption of plastics, supported by cheap natural gas liquids (NGL) prices. \\n\\n• Single use plastic bans and mechanical recycling have a small impact on oil demand. Government targets implemented over the last few years would help reduce oil demand by 700 kb/d by 2025, up from 380 kb/d in 2019; a net incremental impact of 315 kb/d in six years. This is equivalent to shedding about 5% of the increase in oil demand. \\n\\n• The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) rules on sulphur in bunker fuels were implemented on 1 January 2020. Based on the situation to date, we revised higher our estimate for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) demand to 1.3 mb/d in 2020 and 2.1 mb/d in 2025. High sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) consumption decreases by 1.8 mb/d year-on-year in 2020, but will stabilise thereafter, supported by vessels equipped with scrubbers. \\n\\n• A common feature impacting all segments of the oil market is the acceleration of the energy \\n\\ntransition  in recent years. In this report, we look at the impact of transportation policies. \\n\\n# Global oil demand by product \\n\\nOil demand will grow on average by 950 kb/d each year between 2019 and 2025 (5.7 mb/d in total), a one-third reduction from the rate seen in the previous ten years. This is mainly due to demand for diesel and gasoline approaching a plateau, as new efficiency standards are applied to internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles hit the market. Petrochemical Oil Market Report 2020 Demand   \\n\\n> PAGE |10\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nfeedstocks LPG/ethane and naphtha will drive around half of all oil products demand growth, helped by continued growth in plastics demand and cheap NGLs in North America. Meanwhile, demand for residual fuel will increase by a modest 0.4% per year. However, this hides an important shift where VLSFO surges in 2020, becoming the fastest growing oil product over 2019-25, while HSFO demand falls 60% in 2020, before stabilising. \\n\\nAs we publish this report, COVID-19 looks likely to have a significant impact on oil demand, triggering the first annual decline in consumption since 2009. The virus shut extensive parts of the People’s Republic of China’s (hereafter “China”) transport and economic systems in 1Q20 and had spread to the rest of Asia, Europe, North America and other parts of the world. Our base case is for an 90 kb/d annual decline in oil demand in 2020. This assumes that the virus comes under control in China from the end of March, and that more limited containment measures in Korea, Japan, the Middle East and Europe affect oil demand further. The OECD’s economic outlook of 2 March 2020, which assumes global growth of 2.4% (down from 2.9% previously) underpins our projections. Finally, we have assumed one-off impacts for the global transport industry (and therefore jet fuel, diesel and gasoline deliveries) in 1Q and 2Q20. The general assumption is that the virus does not spread further and that economic growth returns to normal in the second half of 2020. \\n\\nAfter a difficult 2020, oil demand growth rebounds to 2.1 mb/d in 2021, the most in seven years. Our analysis is that the world’s transport and manufacturing systems will remain intact and that usual consumer behaviour will resume, hence the return to a “normal” oil consumption volume in that year and the strong year-on-year growth this implies. From 2022 onwards, oil demand growth comes down to 1.1 mb/d and then falls below the 1 mb/d threshold in 2023 and subsequent years, as fuel savings in the transport sector begin to have a meaningful impact. \\n\\nTable 1.1 Global oil demand by product (mb/d) \\n\\nProduct  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  Annual % Growth \\n\\nAnnual Growth \\n\\nLPG/Ethane  12.6  13.0  13.3  13.6  13.9  14.1  14.4  2.2%  0.3 \\n\\nNaphtha  6.5  6.6  6.8  7.0  7.3  7.5  7.6  2.8%  0.2 \\n\\nGasoline  26.4  26.2  26.6  26.7  26.8  26.9  26.9  0.3%  0.1 \\n\\nJet/Kerosene  8.0  7.9  8.1  8.3  8.4  8.4  8.5  1.1%  0.1 \\n\\nGasoil/Diesel  28.9  29.2  29.5  29.6  29.8  29.9  30.0  0.6%  0.2 \\n\\nResidual fuel  6.3  5.7  6.2  6.4  6.4  6.4  6.4  0.3%  0.0 \\n\\nOther products  11.3  11.4  11.4  11.5  11.6  11.6  11.7  0.7%  0.1 \\n\\nTotal products  100.0  99.9  102.0  103.1  104.0  104.9  105.7  0.9%  1.0 \\n\\n# Petrochemicals reign over demand growth \\n\\nPetrochemical fuels naphtha, LPG and ethane will be responsible for half of all oil products demand growth over 2019-25, or 490 kb/d per year on average. In volumetric terms, this is only slightly more than in 2010-19 (470 kb/d). This is a larger contribution (in relative terms) than in the previous 10-year period, when they were responsible for one third of all growth, as demand for other products is stagnating or falling. \\n\\nLPG, ethane and naphtha consumption will grow in line with higher feedstock requirements in the petrochemical industry, the result of rising plastic demand, which will increase by 2.6% per year on average during 2019-25 (See Plastic demand falls short of GDP ), and with higher demand for petrochemicals in other sectors (e.g. electronics, detergents, pharmaceuticals, and paints).

All rights reserved.\\n\\nPlentiful LPG and ethane supplies linked to the oil and gas production boom in the United States will continue to play an important role by reducing the cost of feedstocks for US crackers. \\n\\nWe expect naphtha demand to increase by 200 kb/d per year during the period to 2025, nearly double the 2010-19 average, with planned cracker investments in Asia fuelling growth (See \\n\\nPetrochemical capacity grows rapidly ). LPG/ethane deliveries, by contrast, are likely to slow marginally, from growth of 360 kb/d during 2010-19 to 290 kb/d over the forecast period, as the boom in ethane cracker investments seen in North America progressively comes to an end. That being said, LPG and ethane will together remain the fastest growing fuels by volume, despite representing only 13% of oil products consumption at the time of writing. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nLPG, ethane and naphtha contribute half of all oil products demand growth to 2025. \\n\\nIn 2019 we saw much lower combined LPG/ethane and naphtha demand growth than expected (only 130 kb/d), as reduced naphtha crackers utilisation in Europe and Asia offset new build capacity expansions. Also, several ethane crackers in the United States saw unscheduled stoppages, while the commissioning of several new units were delayed. Lower global economic growth, partly due to trade tensions between China and the United States, also played a role. A total of 300 kb/d of new ethane and naphtha cracker capacity is likely to be commissioned in 2020, with a further 2.2 mb/d planned over the 2021-25 period (see Demand Appendix ). \\n\\n# Gasoline demand slowing \\n\\nDemand for gasoline, the second biggest oil products market, will grow the least over the forecast period, with demand up by just 90 kb/d per year. The United States, its biggest market, as well as much of the OECD, will decline, and gains in China, India and other non-OECD countries just about compensate this decrease. We expect gasoline demand to almost reach a plateau at the end of the forecast period. \\n\\nImproved car efficiency standards implemented in the last few years are the main reason (see \\n\\nTransport in transition ). For example, the average gasoline car is expected to be 7% more efficient in the United States and nearly 11% more efficient in Europe by 2025, compared with 2019, taking           \\n\\n> -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 mb/d\\n> Naphtha\\n> LPG/Ethane Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |12\\n> IEA.

In the developing world, gains in efficiency are likely to be even more substantial, given that the average car currently on the road is older. However, rates of car ownership are far lower and rising sales will boost gasoline demand. \\n\\nGasoline consumption growth reached 900 kb/d in 2015, after the collapse in oil prices, and has been decelerating ever since. In 2019, the 26 mb/d market grew by only 210 kb/d, supported mainly by gains China, India and Indonesia. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nGlobal gasoline consumption plateaus after 2024. \\n\\n# Middle distillates see mixed picture \\n\\nDiesel, gasoil, jet fuel and kerosene demand will increase by 280 kb/d each year on average during the forecast period, a much slower rate of growth than the 640 kb/d registered over the previous 10 years. Jet fuel and kerosene demand will grow by 90 kb/d on average, down from 180 kb/d, while combined gasoil and diesel demand will grow by just 190 kb/d, less than half its ten year average of 460 kb/d. \\n\\nDiesel consumption will continue to increase (+110 kb/d on average); however, just like gasoline, growth will decelerate progressively to only 30 kb/d in 2025. Improved fuel efficiency standards in Europe will pressure demand from diesel vehicles. Compared with 2019, we expect the average diesel vehicle (both cars and trucks) to be 4% more efficient in the United States and 7% more efficient in Europe by 2025. In non-OECD countries, efficiency gains are likely to be substantial too (e.g. 8% in China, India and the Russian Federation [hereafter “Russia”]). \\n\\nJet fuel and kerosene consumption growth will be 90 kb/d per year over the forecast period, the most for any oil product other than for petrochemicals and VLSFO. It represents nevertheless a significant slowdown compared to recent growth rates, as fast growing markets become more mature and energy efficiency improves. Chinese and Indian passenger traffic, for example, slowed significantly in 2019 after strong growth in 2018. Chinese air passenger traffic growth declined from 13% in 2017 to 11% in 2018 and 8% in 2019. India domestic traffic growth dropped from 19% in 2018 to 4% in 2019. All of the growth will be driven by rising demand for air travel,          \\n\\n> -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 mb/d\\n> Japan/Korea\\n> Europe\\n> US\\n> India\\n> China\\n> RoW\\n> Total Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |13\\n> IEA.

The largest contributors to growth will be China (+30 kb/d), Europe (+10 kb/d), the United States (+10 kb/d) and India (+10 kb/d). We have included an average improvement in fuel efficiency for aircraft of 6% by 2025, compared with 2019, taking into account the commissioning of new, more modern planes and continuous improvements in flight routing technology. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nDiesel, gasoil and jet fuel demand will grow far less quickly than in the 2010-19 period. \\n\\nFinally, the IMO bunker fuel standards have driven a change in the bunker fuel product mix for the coming decade. We estimate that marine gasoil demand will jump by 490 kb/d in 2020 as the fuel is readily available in most ports globally and provides a straightforward compliance option for shippers. It will then decline by an average 70 kb/d per year in 2021-24 displaced by VLSFO and HSFO burning by ships equipped with scrubbers. \\n\\n# Fuel oil navigates shifting standards \\n\\nResidual fuel demand will be more or less stable over the forecast period, rising by just 20 kb/d on average. However, this hides significant year-on-year differences as well as intra-fuel changes. In 2020, as the new IMO rules are introduced, HSFO consumption is forecast to decrease by 1.8 mb/d, or more than 50%, to 1.2 mb/d, as ship operators switch to marine gasoil and VLSFO to comply. It will stabilise thereafter due to the growing number of vessels equipped with scrubbers. We expect non-compliance with IMO rules of around 12% in 2020, down from 15% in last year’s report, owing to the larger consumption of VLSFO. \\n\\nOur forecast of 2 500 scrubbers in place by end-2019 has been more or less realised, and we have left unchanged from last year’s report our forecasts for 2020 (4 000 scrubbers), 2021 (4 700), 2022 (4 900), 2023 (5 000) and 2024 (5 200). Altogether, 700 kb/d of HSFO in 2020 will be used in ships fitted with scrubbers, growing to 1.1 mb/d by 2025. \\n\\nThe major area of uncertainty is VLSFO, given that the product is relatively new. We expect consumption to increase by a sharp 1.1 mb/d in 2020, as evidenced by the rapid take-up in major bunkering hubs such as Rotterdam and Singapore and the relative ease with which oil refiners             \\n\\n> -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> Historical\\n> Forecast Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |14\\n> IEA.

VLSFO will be the fastest growing product in the whole oil barrel. In Singapore, deliveries of VLSFO rose from 40 kb/d in September 2019 to 550 kb/d in December, while HSFO bunker deliveries declined from 720 kb/d to 270 kb/d in over the same period. In early 2020, VLSFO accounted for 60% of bunker sales in Singapore. \\n\\nTable 1.2 Bunker fuel demand (mb/d) \\n\\nProduct  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  Annual % Growth \\n\\nAnnual Growth \\n\\nMarine gasoil  0.9  1.3  1.2  1.1  1.1  1.0  1.0  2.5%  2.3% \\n\\nVLSFO  0.2  1.3  1.6  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  51.0%  31.5% \\n\\nMarine HSFO  2.9  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2  1.2  -13.7%  -28.5% \\n\\nTotal bunker  3.9  3.8  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.2  4.3  1.3%  5.2% \\n\\nFinally, inland demand for fuel oil (largely burned to produce electricity in the Middle East and some remote locations) is expected to go up by around 50 kb/d in 2020 and a further 220 kb/d in 2021, as the price of HSFO falls.

However, given the stellar rise of the Chinese economy since the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the growth in trade, the impact will be felt widely. Other economies most exposed to China, or which have developed cases of COVID-19 of their own, will also see a slowdown in GDP growth. \\n\\nIn 2019, the global economy saw a significant deterioration in world trade and industrial activity. World industrial production growth has also posted a spectacular decline since mid-2018. However, while recent prompt economic indicators remain mixed, trade tensions have eased. Trade agreements between the United States and Japan, or the United States, Canada, and Mexico and the phase one deal between the United States and China could alleviate trade tensions. \\n\\nChina, India car sales showed recovery at the end of 2019.       \\n\\n> 150 200 250 300 350 Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Units (,000)\\n\\nIndia Passenger Car Sales         \\n\\n> Range 14-18 2018\\n> 2019 5-year avg\\n> 1 000 1 200 1 400 1 600 1 800 2 000 2 200 2 400 2 600 2 800 Jan Mar May Jul Sep Nov Units (,000)\\n\\nChina Passenger Car Sales      \\n\\n> Range 14-18 2018\\n> 2019 5-year avg Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |16\\n> IEA.

Credit restrictions in China and India, taxation changes and new environmental tests in Europe significantly reduced sales in 2018 and a large part of 2019. However, the car market started to recover in 4Q19. For the whole of 2019, new vehicle sales fell by 1.3% in the United States, 2.4% in the United Kingdom, 4.8% in Spain, 3.3% in Thailand, 10.5% in Indonesia, 2.3% in Russia, 23.3% in Turkey, 42.8% in Argentina, 8.2% in China and 12.7% in India. Some countries performed better, such as Brazil where vehicle sales rose by 8.6%. In addition, thanks to a strong rebound at the end of 2019, German car sales ended the year 5% above 2018 levels and French car sales were up 1.9%. In December, European Union car sales rose by 21.7%. \\n\\nUS economic growth will slow from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020 and be 1.6%-1.7% thereafter, as the effects of tax cuts and fiscal expansion fade away. Investment activity has been subdued in recent months, due to policy uncertainty in relation to the trade tensions with China. US unemployment remains low, however, and this is supporting consumption. \\n\\nGrowth in Europe has deteriorated significantly in recent quarters. In particular, the German industrial sector has been impacted by problems in the motor industry and lower Asian demand for its products. The economic environment should improve in the coming years however, on better external demand. UK growth should accelerate in 2021, assuming an orderly Brexit. \\n\\nChina’s GDP growth fell to 6.1% in 2019 and is expected to slow further to 4.9% in 2020. However, at the time of writing this report there is considerable uncertainty due to the coronavirus. Our forecast assumes a return to normal levels of activity in the second half of 2020. The phase one trade agreement with the United States could support growth when activity picks up. \\n\\nIndian growth was disappointing in 2019, slowing to 4.8% from 6.8% in 2018. Poor weather conditions and a decline in credit growth explain the slowdown. However, recent data appear relatively supportive. Growth is expected to accelerate slightly to 5.1% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2021, supported by monetary and fiscal policies. \\n\\n# Global oil demand by region \\n\\nTable 1.4 Global oil demand by region (mb/d) \\n\\nProduct  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  Annual % Growth \\n\\nAnnual Growth \\n\\nNorth America  25.2  25.3  25.4  25.4  25.5  25.4  25.4  0.1%  0.0 \\n\\nLatin America  6.7  6.7  6.7  6.8  6.9  7.0  7.0  0.8%  0.1 \\n\\nEurope  15.6  15.4  15.5  15.6  15.6  15.6  15.6  0.0%  0.0 \\n\\nAfrica  4.3  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.7  4.8  4.8  2.0%  0.1 \\n\\nMiddle East  8.4  8.4  8.6  8.6  8.6  8.6  8.7  0.6%  0.0 \\n\\nEurasia  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.5  4.6  0.9%  0.0 \\n\\nAsia Pacific  35.6  35.4  36.8  37.7  38.4  39.1  39.8  1.9%  0.7 \\n\\nWorld  100.0  99.9  102.0  103.1  104.0  104.9  105.7  0.9%  1.0 \\n\\nAs the pace of global oil demand growth falls from 1.5 mb/d in 2010-19 to 950 kb/d in our forecast period, the Asia Pacific region takes on a more prominent role in relative terms.

The slowdown is largely attributable to China, where growth will halve by 2025 compared with the 2010-19 average. Demand from the Middle East will grow by just 50 kb/d per year during 2019-25, down from 120 kb/d, as a result of slowing economic growth and rising competition from natural gas in the power sector. Finally, oil demand growth will remain robust in Africa and Latin America. \\n\\n## China \\n\\nOil demand will grow by 300 kb/d on average over the forecast period, down from 570 kb/d over the previous 10 years. We expect growth to fall sharply in 2020, by 270 kb/d, due to the COVID-19 epidemic. This is the largest fall since our data begins in 1971. It will bounce back in 2021 as the economy recovers, before slowing progressively to just 230 kb/d in 2025. \\n\\nThe number of cars on the road will increase, but gasoline demand growth will slow markedly, to only 60 kb/d in 2025, as a result of improving fuel efficiencies, stringent car ownership limits in large cities and higher electric vehicle sales. Combined gasoil and diesel consumption will rise by 30 kb/d per year. This is a slower rate of growth than in 2010-19 (+80 kb/d), and is largely related to the development of alternative fuels for trucks and buses. Gasoil demand has been impacted in recent years by the gradual transformation of China from a manufacturing economy into a service economy and by local regulations to limit air pollution. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

Gasoil demand growth will accelerate from 2021, supported by significantly stronger economic growth. Gasoline demand will increase by 40 kb/d, confirming its dynamism, with solid growth in demand for both two-wheelers and passenger cars. \\n\\nIndian economic activity decelerated sharply in 2019 with GDP growth of only 4.8%, the slowest pace since the financial crisis in 2008-09.

Projects are underway to increase fuel oil generating capacity by 8.5 gigawatt (GW). These include the 2.5 GW Jazan project, associated with the new 400 kb/d refinery, using HSFO as a feedstock to produce synthetic gas for electricity generation. We expect a further 5.6 GW of large steam turbines using HSFO as a feedstock to be commissioned. In addition, Saudi Arabia has 18.3 GW of oil-fired capacity currently using an estimated 400 kb/d of crude oil. Some of these plants could switch to fuel oil. Overall, Saudi Arabia’s power sector is projected to increase its use of fuel oil by 70 kb/d in 2021 and to reduce it thereafter. By contrast, direct crude use will decline, displaced by natural gas and fuel oil. \\n\\nIraq is another Middle Eastern country set to use more natural gas in the power sector at the expense of crude oil.

Overall, we expect the country’s oil demand to increase moderately over the forecast period. \\n\\nIran ’s demand should remain largely unchanged, as higher fuel oil use in the power sector offsets falling deliveries in other sectors due to the tough economic situation. Since 2014, Iran has seen a very large decline in gasoil and fuel oil use in the power sector and higher use of natural gas. According to some reports, this decline may have been reversed recently due to lower oil and gas output as the result of US sanctions. We assume in our forecast that Iran will use additional fuel oil to replace this gas and take advantage of lower fuel prices. Some 32.4 GW of capacity, mainly using natural gas, can switch to fuel oil. \\n\\nPakistan ’s oil demand is forecast to fall slightly over 2019-25, as growing competition from coal and gas in the power sector offsets growth in transport fuels. Demand dropped sharply in 2018 as more coal and gas were used at the expense of fuel oil. In 2015, Pakistan built a liquefied natural gas (LNG) floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), initially receiving 1 million tonnes (Mt), rising to 3.4 Mt in 2016, and 6 Mt in 2017. A second FSRU started operations in 2018 and a third in 2019. By 2022, seven FSRUs will allow the import of 30 Mt/y of LNG. At the same time, Pakistan is developing 8 GW of coal-fired power generation capacity. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

After two years of steady decline, demand returned to growth in 2017 as the economy emerged from recession. It then stagnated in 2018 and grew by 70 kb/d in 2019. Argentina ’s oil demand collapsed in 2018 as GDP fell by 2.5% and declined again in 2019. A return to economic growth should see demand rise by 10 kb/d per year to 2025. \\n\\nRussian fuel oil demand will temporarily increase in 2021-22 as excess HSFO is expected to be used in the power and district heating sectors. Russia has the world’s largest district heating network, mostly fuelled by coal and natural gas. Alternatively, HSFO could replace some coal or gas used as fuel in cement factories or other heavy industries. Some HSFO could also be used as a fuel for domestic river transport. Russian demand will also be supported by petrochemical projects, with LPG and ethane growing at an average of 10 kb/d per year in 2019-25.          \\n\\n> -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 mb/d\\n> Other Non-OECD\\n> India\\n> China Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |20\\n> IEA.

The last few years saw significant differences between OECD regions, with petrochemical-led growth in the Americas contrasting declines in Europe and relative stability in Asia (where growing petrochemical feedstock demand also offsets transport fuel demand). This will change, as tighter vehicle fuel efficiency standards and electric vehicles curb transport fuel demand everywhere and as the expansion of the US petrochemical industry slows. Demand will grow by 30 kb/d per year in the Americas, by 10 kb/d in Asia Oceania, and decline by 30 kb/d in Europe. \\n\\nUS oil demand is expected to increase on average by only 30 kb/d to 2025, down from 170 kb/d during 2010-19. LPG/ethane and naphtha consumption will grow strongly in 2020 (+210 kb/d) as a result of the delayed opening of several crackers and with other projects being commissioned. However, growth will come down thereafter, to around 70 kb/d. Diesel and gasoline deliveries will decline by 10 kb/d and 70 kb/d per year, respectively. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

Gasoline demand will fall 20 kb/d per year and diesel demand will decline even faster, by 50 kb/d. This is largely a consequence of Europe’s disaffection for diesel, which has benefitted gasoline-fuelled car sales and electric vehicles. Concerns about air pollution and city restrictions have considerably reduced the share of diesel vehicles in new sales from a peak of 55% in the European Union in 2011-12 to only 31% in 2019. In addition, early 2020 data point to a sharp increase in EV sales in some countries driven by 2020 European Union (EU) CO2 standards. \\n\\nKorean oil demand should remain supported by petrochemical feedstocks over the forecast period, and grow by 40 kb/d on average.

Gasoline will experience most of the fall. \\n\\n# Plastics’ impact on oil demand \\n\\nSingle use plastic bans, recycling targets and other innovative plastic technologies, if they are implemented fully, will only have a moderate impact on overall plastics consumption and thus feedstock oil demand over the forecast period. We estimate that they will help reduce oil demand by 700 kb/d by 2025, up from 380 kb/d in 2019; a net incremental impact of 315 kb/d in six years. In relative terms, this is equivalent to shedding about 5% of the increase in oil demand (+5.8 mb/d) that we forecast between 2019 and 2025. This assumes that major consuming countries meet their ambitious targets for recycling and that single use plastic bans drive a meaningful reduction in plastic use (-1.3% by 2025), based on the share of these items in overall plastic consumption. However, poor data on plastic demand worldwide and the behaviour of consumers regarding plastic packaging are major uncertainties. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nSingle use plastic bans and recycling, if applied fully, would reduce 2025 oil demand by 700 kb/d. \\n\\n# Petrochemical capacity grows rapidly \\n\\nNew steam crackers and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) plants will add 1.8 mb/d to worldwide petrochemical supply by 2025. Capacity expansion will be almost equally split between LPG/ethane (+910 kb/d) and naphtha (+900 kb/d), in contrast to the last few years which saw more focus on LPG/ethane. Countries showing the strongest increases are the United States and China, with Russia also a major player. All the petrochemical investments are concentrated in 12 countries. Growth of 1.8 mb/d in petrochemical supply capacity is largely comparable to the increase in naphtha and LPG/ethane feedstocks demand from the plastic sector (+1.8 mb/d), indicating the support for the investments made by petrochemical companies. Our global oil demand figures for LPG/ethane and naphtha are largely driven by these capacity additions,          \\n\\n> 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 kb/d\\n> Chemical Recycling\\n> Bioplastics\\n> Post-2019 Single Use Bans\\n> Mechanical Recycling Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |22\\n> IEA.

We have also assumed growth for LPG/ethane and naphtha coming from existing petrochemical plants (via higher utilisation), non-identified projects, and through non-petrochemical uses, such as heating, cooking or crop drying. \\n\\nPetrochemical projects currently under construction or confirmed to be built are included in our analysis. It should be noted that there is still time for additional projects to be sanctioned to boost capacity in the years 2024-25. Such investment decisions would probably require further confidence in increased consumption. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nGrowth in plastic demand matches petrochemical capacity investments to 2025. \\n\\nContinuous growth of shale oil and gas production has seen the United States rapidly add new ethane steam cracker capacity to take advantage of low feedstock prices. By 2025, ethylene production capacity will further increase by nearly 9.5 Mt/y, from 36 Mt/y in 2019. Several large scale ethylene plants are expected to be part of integrated petrochemical complexes, including polyethylene units. This wave of new projects will help the United States to not only meet growing domestic demand but supply export markets too. Overall, these projects will boost US LPG/ethane demand by 380 kb/d by 2025. \\n\\nAs the Chinese economy becomes increasingly consumer-focused and to supply plastic needed in manufacturing, 9.2 Mt/y of petrochemical capacity is due to come onstream by 2025, in addition to the 20 Mt/y existing in 2019. Unlike in the United States, Chinese capacity additions are mainly naphtha crackers. However, China is also planning to use LPG and ethane which could be imported from the United States, provided the United States/China trade dispute is resolved on a long-term basis. Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co. Ltd., the country’s largest acrylic acid and acrylates manufacturer, plans to commission two ethane crackers each with 1.25  Mt/y of capacity in 2021 and 2022. In total, Chinese LPG/ethane and naphtha demand grow by 170 kb/d and 355 kb/d, respectively by the end of the forecast period. \\n\\nIn other Asian countries, naphtha crackers dominate the capacity increase and push up feedstock demand. Korea could add 2.6 Mt/y of production capacity, resulting in extra demand for naphtha of 140 kb/d. In Indonesia , two naphtha plants (each with 1 Mt/y of capacity), will come onstream           \\n\\n> 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2020-25 mb/d\\n> Oil Demand Growth from Plastics Petrochemical Capacity Additions Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |23\\n> IEA.

Among others, by 2025 Viet Nam sees an increase of 7.5 kb/d of LPG/ethane demand while Thailand sees increases of LPG/ethane and naphtha demand by 15 kb and 30 kb/d, respectively. \\n\\nThe Middle East and North Africa regions are likely to witness large capacity additions in the second half of the forecast period, led by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (hereafter “UAE”). In Egypt, a 1.5  Mt/y naphtha cracker will start operations in 2023 and boost demand by 95 kb/d by 2025. Another 1.5 Mt/y capacity ethane cracker in the UAE will be onstream by 2025, adding 40 kb/d. Iran could commission a 20 kb/d PDH project in 2022, unless US sanctions prevent its completion. \\n\\nIn Russia , over 3.7 Mt/y of new production capacity is under construction.

We also expect it to be lower than the annual average growth in GDP of 3.5%. This lag is due to the fact that developed economies are unlikely to see much growth, even if GDP and population numbers increase. \\n\\nPlastic demand in those economies has reached saturation point and, if anything, could come under pressure from government regulations and plastic’s increasingly bad reputation with consumers. As more countries reach advanced stages of development over the next few years, the elasticity of plastic demand falls thus capping total growth at the global level. By contrast, demand will grow robustly in China (+2.8% per year), India (+9.6%), Indonesia (+5.8%) and Viet Nam (+4.3%), as the consumption of goods increases. In those countries, it is assumed that plastic use continues to develop in line with historic patterns.                     \\n\\n> 0250 500 750 1 000 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 kb/d LPG/ethane Naphtha\\n> United States China Russia Belgium\\n> 0250 500 750 1 000 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\n> Korea Indonesia Egypt Other countries Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |24\\n> IEA.

Each country has been classified according to its level of development (measured in terms of GDP per capita) along this curve. The underlying plastic demand data is from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Plastics Europe. We have also used GDP forecasts from the IMF and population figures from the United Nations (UN). \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nGlobal plastic demand grows at steady 2.6% pace to 2025, though it is less than GDP growth. \\n\\n# Plastic backlash doesn’t endanger demand growth \\n\\nPlastic use has come under scrutiny in recent years due to mounting evidence about the pollution it creates both onland and at sea. A backlash has been widely relayed by the media and is starting to affect consumer behaviour in developed countries (mainly Europe, but also North America, Japan and Korea) and developing markets. Around 400 leading consumer goods companies have signed a pledge promoted by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to reduce plastic content in their products and boost the use of recycled material. In 2019, 186 countries agreed a UN convention to reduce ocean plastic waste. \\n\\nIn addition, the UN estimates that 120 countries had introduced some form of ban on plastic bags in 2019 with a further 60 having implemented taxes on them. This flurry of initiatives is bound to reduce demand; however the question is: how much? Based on the information available, we take the view in this report that while single use bans and recycling will dent petrochemical fuel demand, this will not be enough to slow feedstock demand materially. We have not modelled specifically the impact of voluntary decisions by brands or consumers to reduce plastic use, however it is assumed to be part of the same trend. \\n\\nEstimating the share of single use plastics (ie, in use for less than a year) in overall plastics demand is hard, given the lack of reliable data at the retail level in most countries. However, it is widely assumed to represent around 30-50% of the total plastics use, taking into account the known production of plastic resins such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). We estimate that only around 5% of single use volumes, representing about 1.3% of plastic demand, are threatened by government regulations in 2025. This is because the items targeted (plastic bags, straws, disposable cups, plates and cutlery, cotton buds, etc) weigh                   \\n\\n> 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 million tonnes\\n> Plastic demand by resin\\n> PET HDPE PVC LDPE PP PS Other\\n> -6% -4% -2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 % YoY\\n> Plastic demand, GDP growth\\n> Plastics Demand Global GDP (IMF) Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |25\\n> IEA.

Regulations do not typically target food packaging or plastic used in the medical, construction, automotive, toy, consumer electronics and textile industries, which represent the bulk of volumes. In addition, bans are likely to be enforced progressively in most countries and in some cases, will result in higher demand for other types of plastic. \\n\\nIn total, bans cut 1 Mt (out of 379 Mt) from plastic demand in 2019 than would otherwise be the case, growing to 6 Mt (out of 435 Mt) by 2025. These volumes are based on the relatively simple assumption that 2% of volumes for certain plastic resins (PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) will be suppressed by 2025, growing in a linear progression from nearly zero in 2019. This percentage is based on various studies and the experience of the implementation of such policies by governments worldwide. In our model, we apply a multiplier to each plastic resin demand forecast, based on whether it is at risk or not from single use bans. Overall, this result in plastic demand destruction of 1.3% by 2025 compared with a no-ban scenario. \\n\\nPlastic recycling will have a large impact over the forecast period, due to its already widespread use in many parts of the world and as a result of aggressive collection targets in some countries. We estimate that recycling will reduce demand for petrochemical fuels such as naphtha, ethane and LPG by 535 kb/d by 2025, versus 380 kb/d in 2019, resulting in a net incremental loss of oil demand of 155 kb/d by 2025. These volumes are based on announced government targets for plastic recycling and expectations about the rise of chemical recycling and bioplastics. This assumes broadly that government targets are met, as plastics have risen high on the public agenda and there is significant political momentum to increase recycling. However, achieving these targets will be difficult given the inertia built into the system and in many countries, the need for new investments. China’s decision to ban imports of all but the highest purity plastics in 2018 has forced many countries to reconsider their approach to recycling and invest in recycling capacity at home. If we include the impact of single use bans announced in the last two years, the volume of oil displaced grows to 700 kb/d by 2025, or a net loss of oil demand of 315 kb/d compared with 2019. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

All rights reserved.\\n\\nEuropean countries are likely to boost collection rates by around 5-6 percentage points overall between 2019 and 2025, resulting in 7.5 Mt of additional volumes collected for recycling over the period. Collection rates for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used in beverage bottles, will be the highest, at 73%, slightly less than the European Union’s 75% objective. China will also see large increases in plastic collection over the period (+8.7 Mt), in line with targets to recycle around 35% of municipal waste in 46 major cities by 2020 and newly announced bans on single use plastic, as well as the decision to stop the bulk of plastic imports in 2018, which has left some domestic recycling capacity idle. India (+2.1 Mt) and Korea (+1 Mt) are also set to boost recycling in line with announced policy. By contrast, plastic collection in North America, Latin America, Africa and the rest of Asia is unlikely to progress much, due to a lack of government targets. \\n\\nBy 2025, we estimate that mechanical recycling will reach 80 Mt globally, from 58 Mt in 2019. This amounts to a collection rate of 18%, up from 16% in 2019. This volume does not cover plastic burned to generate electricity, which can be high in certain regions, as it does not displace virgin plastics and thus oil demand. In addition, we assume that only about one fourth of the total plastic collected, or 20 Mt, will effectively displace virgin material due to the typical yield loss at sorting and recycling facilities, as well as the widespread practice of ‘down-cycling’ (i.e., using recycled plastic as replacement for other materials). The majority of recycled plastics goes into creating new products or displaces other materials (e.g. low-quality waste plastics used to pave roads), and does not necessarily replace virgin plastic. \\n\\nWe have also taken into account the likely growth of the chemical recycling and bioplastic industries, which together will replace around 2.1 Mt of virgin plastic by 2025, up from 1 Mt in 2019. Plastic-to-plastic conversion facilities are still at the pilot stage at the time of writing; however several industrial plants are likely to be built over the next few years following announcements by companies such as Carbios (France), Fuenix Ecocy Group (the Netherlands) and Loop (Canada). Bio-based plastics, meanwhile, represent a small share of the plastic market, but are growing at a steady clip. Pyrolysis, the conversion of plastic waste to oil, was not taken into account in this analysis as it mostly produces gasoil (and does not replace virgin plastic). We have also excluded biodegradable plastics, as these come from fossil sources. \\n\\n# Transport in transition \\n\\nFuel standards, EVs and diesel bans are changing both the volume and the structure of transport fuel demand. Efficiency gains due to vehicle technology improvements and electrification underpin the slowdown in oil demand growth from an annual average rate of 1.5 mb/d in 2010-19 to 980 kb/d in 2020-25. We have modelled the likely efficiency improvements for both diesel and gasoline vehicles in each country based on historical fuel savings data, assumptions about car sales, and have taken into account fuel regulations adopted around the world (including, in the case of the United States, the recent rollback of CAFE standards). Efficiency gains in the vehicle fleet save an estimated 2.5 mb/d of gasoline and 1.3 mb/d of diesel by 2025, compared with a world where efficiency does not improve. Even if these figures are largely theoretical, this helps underscore their dampening effect on oil demand. The same regulations often drive electric vehicle development and are modelled as part of the same trend. \\n\\nIn addition, many cities have undertaken strong measures to reduce air pollution, in particular CO2, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide generated by international combustion engines, targeting in particular diesel engines. They have pushed for a higher share of electric cars, less polluting fossil-fuelled vehicles, the development of electric taxis and buses, as well as Oil Market Report 2020 Demand   \\n\\n> PAGE |27\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nincreasingly severe restrictions on private car use. These actions influence consumer behaviour and thus oil consumption  patterns, and accelerate the impact of decisions taken at the global level. \\n\\n# Tight standards cap fuel use \\n\\nFuel standards have tightened in a number of prominent oil consuming countries, including Europe, Korea, China and India. We have assumed that these regulations are respected and that fuel savings accelerate over the next few years. As the vehicle fleet has a turnover of 12 to 16 years on average (depending on the car model and consumer preferences), efficiency improvements realised since 2005 continue to have an impact over the forecast period. \\n\\nTable 1.5 Annual car efficiency gains in selected countries, 2019-25                             \\n\\n> Country/Region Gasoline Diesel\\n> United States 1.3% 0.7%\\n> Canada 1.1% 0.5%\\n> Mexico 1.7% 0.3%\\n> Japan 1.9% 0.7%\\n> Korea 1.7% 1.4%\\n> Australia 1.6% 1.8%\\n> EU17 1.8% 1.2%\\n> EU7 1.8% 1.7%\\n> Russia 1.0% 1.4%\\n> China 1.7% 1.4%\\n> India 1.8% 1.3%\\n> Indonesia 1.0% 0.7%\\n> Brazil 1.2% 1.5%\\n\\nIn our forecast, fuel efficiency progresses through 2025 as older vehicles come out of the fleet and are replaced by new ones. The largest and most visible impacts will be in the OECD, as several of its members (particularly Europe, Japan and Korea) have adopted tight standards. But vehicle efficiency will improve materially in non-OECD countries too, even if it is not enough to arrest oil demand gains given the big potential for fleet expansion. It should also be noted that gains are more marked for gasoline than for diesel, as there is comparatively less potential for technological improvements in diesel engines. \\n\\nIn the United States , fuel economy standards  will bring about a contraction in gasoline demand in the medium-term. The CAFE standards introduced in 2012 mandated a strong improvement in fuel economy for passenger cars and light trucks. For cars, this corresponds to 2025 fuel consumption of 4.2 litres/100km, or 56.7 miles per gallon (mpg), and for light trucks 6 litres/100km. In 2018, the standards were frozen indefinitely by the US Administration. However, many states and cities (e.g. California and Northeastern states) representing around one third of the car fleet have decided to adhere to stricter rules and this will help improve the overall efficiency of the fleet. In the United States, the historical annual improvement in gasoline fuel efficiency was over 1% during 2015-19. We forecast this to reach 1.3% from 2019 to 2025. \\n\\nPast efficiency gains continue to have an impact into the future. New car consumption is expected to decrease from 8.2 litres/100 km in 2019 to 6.7 litres/100 km in 2025. Even if we Oil Market Report 2020 Demand   \\n\\n> PAGE |28\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nmaintain new car consumption at 8.2 litres/100 km through the end of the forecast, total gasoline fleet efficiency gains would still be declining, but at a slightly lower rate. In addition, Canada has adopted similar regulations and will see continued improvements in efficiency of 1.1% per year for gasoline and 0.5% per year for diesel. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nThe average car gasoline consumption is expected to continue its long-term decline. \\n\\nThe European Union  has implemented progressively tighter fuel economy standards since the 1990s. The 2020 targets, among the strictest in the world, set an almost 30% improvement on the 2015 levels. They aim to curb CO2 emissions below 95 g/km and improve average fuel consumption for new cars to 4.1 litres/100 km on average. In addition, in April 2019, the European Union adopted post-2020 CO2 standards stating that from 2025 new cars and new vans must emit 15% less CO2 on average compared with 2021. From 2030, cars and vans will be required to reduce CO2 emissions compared with 2021 by 37.5% and 31% respectively. In the case of non-compliance, car manufacturers are subject to substantial financial penalties. Low carbon vehicles (battery electric, plug-in hybrids, etc.) are expected to contribute to achieving these targets, but at the time of writing, EV sales are not sufficient and the probability that some automakers will exceed the targets is quite high. Car manufacturers offer a variety of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which emit less CO2. These are expected to gain market share over the forecast period and help to boost efficiency. \\n\\nIn the European Union, the historical annual improvement in fuel efficiency for gasoline cars from 2015 to 2019 was less than 2% and we foresee this to reach 1.8% from 2019 to 2025. We estimate that the average petrol car fleet will improve its fuel efficiency by roughly 11% from 2020 to 2025, driven both by past ameliorations and the tighter standards. \\n\\nJapan has a very efficient passenger car fleet partly due to the high penetration of hybrid vehicles. Its 2020 target of 122 g/km for passenger cars was reached in 2013. It has adopted an objective of 74 g/km for 2030, corresponding to a consumption of 3 litres/100km. Japan is also a leader for light, efficient commercial vehicles, with a target of 133 g/km of CO2 emissions by 2022. In Korea ,fuel efficiency targets are also very strong, imposing gains of 5.5% per year from 2013 to 2020.               \\n\\n> 45678910 11 12 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 litres/100 km\\n> Fuel consumption of new gasoline cars\\n> US EU US (Forecast) EU (Forecast)\\n> 45678910 11 2016 2019 2022 2025\\n> Fuel consumption of gasoline fleet Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |29\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nThe standard for CO2 emissions from new cars is 97 g/km, corresponding to a fuel economy of 4.2 litres/100 km of gasoline. We assume a continued improvement in total gasoline vehicle efficiency of 1.9% per year in Japan and 1.7% in Korea. \\n\\nChina has some of the strictest fuel economy standards in the world. The target for new car average fuel consumption fell from 8.2 litres/100km in 2010 to 5 litres/100 km in 2020 and will decrease to 4 litres/100km by 2025. We assume an improvement in gasoline fleet efficiency of 1.7% per year in 2019-25 and 1.4% per year for diesel. \\n\\nThe Indian government has required an improvement of 1.6% per year in fuel economy for new cars between 2012 and 2022. The passenger car CO2 emissions target is 130 g/km until 2022 and will tighten to 113 g/km from 2022, which is equivalent to gasoline consumption of 4.9 l/100 km. In addition, in 2017, India introduced regulations to reduce the fuel consumption of heavy duty vehicles weighing more than 12 tonnes. This impacts roughly 60% of total fuel use from the haulage fleet. Between 2018 and 2021, new trucks must reduce their consumption by between 5% to 13%, tractors, trucks and trailers by between 7% to 10% and buses by 15%. For India, we see an improvement in total gasoline vehicle efficiency of 1.8% per year in 2019-25 and 1.3% per year for diesel. \\n\\n# Electric vehicle sales increasing in key regions \\n\\nElectric vehicles will have a significant impact on demand to 2025. In our forecast, we assume that the electric vehicle fleet increases from 5 million units in 2018, the last year when historical data is available, to nearly 43 million units by 2025. These figures are based on announced policies and assume that, broadly speaking, countries hit their CO2 reduction targets for the car sector. China accounts for the bulk of the increase, but there are substantial fleet increases in Europe, North America and India too. \\n\\nThere were an estimated 5.4 million electric light duty vehicles (LDVs) in circulation in 2018, of which the vast majority (5.1 million) were passenger cars and only 250 000 were light commercial vehicles (LCVs). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for 65% of the world’s EVs. The number of electric buses is also expected to increase significantly. Some electric buses will be deployed in India, Chile, Europe, the United States and the rest of the world but, until 2025, the development will remain mainly a Chinese story. \\n\\nThe United States had electric LDVs sales of 358 000 units in 2018. This was exceptional growth compared to 200 000 cars in 2017, and is attributable to the launch of the Tesla Model-3. In 2019, sales are estimated to have declined to 337 000, as consumers waited for new models to be introduced in 2020. In particular, new affordable electric SUV-crossovers should support sales. \\n\\nChina is the world’s largest EV market, with 1.16 million cars and LCVs sold in 2018. After growing by 74% in 2017 and 80% in 2018, car sales remained roughly stagnant in 2019, according to preliminary estimates. The fleet of electric LDVs nevertheless reached 3.6 million, an increase of 44%. Chinese electric car sales declined sharply in July 2019, as subsidies were reduced by the government, and did not recover thereafter. The target of the Ministry of Industry was to reach the production of 2 million electric vehicles in 2020 but the COVID-19 crisis is likely to reduce this objective.

License plates are very difficult to obtain.  In Beijing since 2011 plates for gasoline cars are awarded by lottery. The local government wanted to keep the total number of vehicles under 6 million by the end of 2017 and authorities allocated only 150 000 plates each year in 2014-17. In 2018, the annual allocation was reduced to 100 000, 60% of which was reserved for electric vehicles.  In Shanghai, the cost of a plate at auction was close to USD 14 000 in 2018, equivalent to the price of a small car . Since 2012, Guangzhou uses both auctions and lotteries to limit the availability of plates. \\n\\nMany Chinese cities have traffic restrictions based on plate numbers. Even so, congestion and the lack of parking space remain major problems.  There are, however, no restrictions on electric vehicles, with the exception of Beijing which has small limitations in place. This explains why these cities have accounted for more than half of EV sales in China between 2015 and 2017. To support a struggling car industry amid a slowdown in sales, some cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Guiyang) have recently temporarily increased the number of available plates. \\n\\nA key priority for city authorities is often to electrify vehicles with high mileage such as taxis and buses. Shenzhen had electrified its total fleet of 22 000 taxis by the end of 2018. Beijing had 4 000 electric taxis in the middle of 2019 and planned to have 16 000 more by end-2020. Guangzhou had 3 000 electric taxis in 2019 and plans to electrify the whole fleet by 2023. \\n\\nIn addition, the city of Shenzhen had electrified 100% of its 16 500-strong bus fleet by 2018 and estimates that about 7 kb/d of diesel consumption has been replaced. Guangzhou has more than 11 000 electric buses in operation. Ten other large Chinese cities, Nanchang, Chongqing, Wuhan, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing should also have entirely electrified their bus fleet by 2025.            \\n\\n> 0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 2018 2020 2025 millions  Electric car fleet\\n> China Europe North America India Rest of the world\\n> 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.8 1.0 1.3 1.5 2018 2020 2025 millions  Electric bus fleet Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |31\\n> IEA.

Sales rose strongly in the first three quarters of 2019, pointing to annual sales of 580 000 units. Car manufacturers may however have delayed sales beyond the end of 2019 to count them against 2020 CO2 emission standards. \\n\\nMany European cities have recently introduced low-emission areas, including Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Brussels, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Liverpool, London, Madrid, Milan, Oslo, Paris and Rome. They belong to  the 40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), a global coalition to tackle air pollution. At the group’s 2015 conference, the mayors of Athens, Madrid, Mexico City and Paris announced their intention to ban diesel vehicles from their streets by 2025. In all, 34 cities representing 165 million inhabitants pledged to make a large part of their city centre’s emissions-free by 2030 and to buy only zero-emissions buses from 2025. \\n\\nOther large cities in Europe, Asia and the United States have started to seriously consider and to invest in the electric bus option. About 2 220 electric buses are in use in Europe and another 1 600 were on order in 2018, a sharp increase compared with 1 030 in 2017. The Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, Germany and Italy account for the majority of orders. \\n\\nLondon had a fleet of 240 electric buses by the end of 2019, the largest in Europe, and it aims for a zero emission bus fleet by 2037. Paris bought 75 electric buses in 2019. Local operator RATP currently has 950 hybrid powered buses, 140 biofuel buses and 83 electric buses. It will order 800 electric buses to replace existing diesel vehicles and fight pollution in the run-up to the 2024 Olympics. The city wants to have only clean buses by 2025 (4 700 vehicles) using both electricity and biofuels. In the Netherlands, Rotterdam ordered its first 55 electric buses in 2019. Amsterdam uses 100 electric buses and plans to have its whole fleet electrified by 2025. The Dutch provinces of Groningen and Drente have deployed 160 electric buses in 2019. The provinces of Overijssel, Flevoland and Gelderland have ordered 300 electric buses to be deployed from December 2020 to 2023.         \\n\\n> 050 100 150 200 250 300 0100 200 300 400 500 600 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 1,000 units\\n> China Electric buses (left scale)\\n> Diesel displaced (kb/d, right scale) Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |32\\n> IEA.

Diesel’s market share has been mainly captured by gasoline but also by alternative-fueled cars. While efforts to ban urban car use contributed to this decline, customers’ perceptions and, in some cases, higher diesel tax, have been powerful factors. \\n\\nIn Paris, all cars made before 1997 are prohibited on weekdays and some streets will be reserved for electric cars starting 2020. In addition, the city intends to ban diesel from its streets by 2025. Together with the increase of taxes in 2015, the ban has contributed to push down the share of diesel in new car sales from more than 70% in 2012 to 34% today. Since 2017, cars must have an anti-pollution sticker (Euro classes 0 to 6) to circulate in certain large French cities. These stickers help the authorities to activate temporary restrictions during peaks in pollution. In 2019, for example, driving bans were imposed in Lyon, Marseille, Paris and Strasbourg except for the cleanest vehicles. In 2020, new permanent and temporary low emission zones will be created and it will become more difficult for diesel vehicles to obtain a “clean” sticker, thus restricting their access to city centres even further. \\n\\nThe share of diesel in new registrations has also fallen rapidly in Germany , the home of some of the world’s largest car manufacturers, from almost 50% in 2012 to 32% in 2019. A blue badge identifies vehicles emitting low nitrogen oxide levels and is only awarded to Euro 6 diesel cars (manufactured after 2014). In August 2019, there were six diesel traffic restriction zones in four cities, and further zones will be established in 2020.  In February 2018, a German court allowed cities to decide whether they wanted to ban diesel cars on their streets to improve air quality. In May 2018, Hamburg was the first city to do so for certain roads. And the ban impacted 215 000 vehicles, or two-thirds of diesel cars. Berlin banned diesel cars manufactured before 2015 from June 2019 onwards, with some 200 000 cars affected. Frankfurt was allowed by a federal court to ban all (but the most recent) diesel cars from February 2019, concerning 60 000 vehicles.    \\n\\n> 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 050 100 150 200 250 300\\n> Sales, thousands (LHS)\\n> 2018 Share (RHS) Oil Market Report 2020 Demand\\n> PAGE |33\\n> IEA.

Sales plunged after Madrid announced it would ban diesel cars by 2025 and, together with Barcelona, prohibit vehicles manufactured before 2006 and gasoline cars produced before 2000.  In 2019, city authorities extended these bans to newer vehicles. \\n\\nThe share of diesel in new car sales has fallen in the United Kingdom , from 52% in 2012 to 25% currently. Several city initiatives contributed to discourage possible buyers. Liverpool has proposed a temporary ban on diesel starting in 2022. London introduced a toxicity charge for pre-Euro 4 cars in 2017 and  launched an ultra-low emission zone in 2019. These standards will be widened to buses and coaches in 2020 and to a larger area in 2021. London also plans to ban vehicles from certain “pedestrian priority areas” and aims for a zero emissions area in central London by 2025. \\n\\nIn Italy , Milan limited in 2019 city access for cars and a low emissions zone on 70% of the city’s territory. It affects 95% of residents. Euro 4 vehicles were banned from the streets during weekdays. The ban will be extended to all diesel vehicles by 2030. Rome also plans to ban diesel vehicles from the centre by 2024. \\n\\nIn the Netherlands , Rotterdam has already implemented a zero emissions zone for trucks and will create one for freight transport in 2025.  Amsterdam plans to have its city centre accessible only to zero-emission vehicles by 2025. \\n\\nIn Belgium, Brussels has created a low emissions zone and plans to ban all diesel vehicles by 2030. \\n\\nMexico City prevents drivers from using their cars once a week and, since 2008, on Saturdays. \\n\\nAthens bans diesel vehicles from entering the city on certain days, by restricting cars with license plates with odd or even numbers. \\n\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 \\n\\nAlternative \\n\\nDiesel \\n\\nGasoline Oil Market Report 2020 Demand   \\n\\n> PAGE |34\\n> IEA.

In turn, automakers offer various hybrid models and powertrains to meet consumer preference and to facilitate meeting regulations. \\n\\nAccording to the International Council on Clean Transportation , new passenger cars sold in the European Union in 2018 emitted 121 g/km of CO2 on average, 2 g/km higher than in 2017 and still 26 g/km above the 2021 target. The increase in 2018 is attributable to changes in consumer preference from small vehicles, which have comparatively low CO2 emissions, to medium size cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), of which some are crossovers. So far, no major car manufacturer has achieved the 2021 target. The Toyota-Mazda fleet looks to be the closest with average CO2 emissions of 110 g/km for the fleet sold in 2018, versus its target of 94 g/km in 2021. It has the largest share of HEVs, which represent 46% of its sales in Europe. Currently, Toyota (including Lexus) offers 14 models of HEVs covering all vehicle categories (small to large, including the fast growing SUV category which is difficult to fully electrify). A high share of HEVs helps automakers to reduce CO2 emissions to achieve their regulatory targets. \\n\\nIn November 2019, Volkswagen, the world’s largest carmaker, announced a plan to launch 60 new hybrid models by the end of 2029 and sell six million HEVs. Together with BEVs, the company will have 135 electric models on offer. \\n\\nChina, the world’s largest automobile market, accounted for 40% of global electric car sales and half of the existing stock in 2018 thanks to the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Mandate Policy. In June 2019, the government reduced subsidies for NEVs and sales saw significant year-on-year decreases as consumers are quite sensitive to the trade-off between vehicle performance and the up-front costs of owning vehicles (which are higher for EVs). In July 2019, The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released a proposal for NEV Mandate Policy modification which stipulates that the sales of fuel-efficient vehicle (highly likely to include HEVs) could offset certain percentage of the manufacturer’s NEV credit. This modification could effectively work to achieve manufacturers’ fuel efficiency target. HEVs achieve the equivalent or more distance between refuelling stops compared with conventional diesel/gasoline vehicles and are competitively priced against BEVs or fuel cell vehicles. Therefore, they appeal to Chinese consumers who are keen to support the government push toward NEVs, but are not ready to shift to pure-electric vehicles. \\n\\nFor China, as for other major car markets, electrification of vehicles is the main manufacturer strategy to achieve regulated fuel efficiency or CO2 emissions targets. However, it is important to get the right technology to achieve the desired evolution in car sales. HEVs - as a technology - have lower penetration barriers, a more affordable price, and are well adapted to the period of build-up in infrastructure (i.e. charging point). They may have more room to increase their market share. Oil Market Report 2020 Demand \\n\\nPAGE | 35 \\n\\n> IEA.

Supply \\n\\n# Highlights \\n\\n• Global oil production capacity is set to increase by 5.9 mb/d by 2025, which marginally outpaces growth in demand. Robust non-OPEC supply growth in the next few years suggests a likely role for continued OPEC+ market management. \\n\\n• Growth in non-OPEC oil supply tapers off from 2022, allowing OPEC producers from the Middle East to ramp up output to maintain a balanced market. While expansion in the United States slows, it remains the largest source of growth. Significant gains from Brazil, Guyana and Canada contribute to a total non-OPEC increase of 4.5 mb/d through 2025. \\n\\n• As for OPEC, solid growth in the Middle East more than makes up for declines in Africa and Venezuela to boost the group’s crude oil capacity by 1.2 mb/d by 2025.  Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (hereafter “UAE”) lead the gains . If Iran were released from sanctions, a further 1.7 mb/d of capacity could be made available to the market in short order. \\n\\n• The call on OPEC crude  is expected to reach 30.6 mb/d by 2025, 2 mb/d more than the group produced in early 2020. However, spare capacity remains above 3 mb/d, even with Iran still under sanctions. \\n\\n• Oil and gas producers are increasingly under pressure to embrace energy transitions. Many are looking to rise to the challenge by announcing ambitious targets to fight climate change. Clean energy investments are increasing but remain a small percentage of the industry’s overall spending, and the announced targets are unlikely to make a visible impact on global oil supply in this six year forecast. \\n\\n• Global upstream capital investments are expected to rise modestly to USD 491 bn (+1.5%) in 2020, as increased offshore activity offsets further declines in the shale sector. In the United States, heightened focus on capital discipline and investor returns by independent producers and the growing presence of the major oil companies has tempered the rush to growth seen in recent years. \\n\\n# Global overview \\n\\nGlobal oil supply looks comfortable through the forecast period. The world’s oil production capacity is expected to rise by 5.9 mb/d by 2025, which more than covers growth in demand. Gains in supply are heavily front-loaded, however, and robust non-OPEC growth through 2021 suggests that there is likely to be a role for OPEC+ market management during the first part of the period. From 2022, the United States loses steam allowing OPEC producers from the Middle East to turn up the taps to help keep the oil market in balance. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |38\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nThe United States leads the way as the largest source of new supply, and given its huge resource potential it could produce still more if prices were higher than assumed in the futures curve used for our analysis. Brazil, Guyana, Iraq, the UAE and Canada also deliver impressive gains. Colombia, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation (hereafter, “Russia”), Egypt, Nigeria and Angola post the biggest declines. Total non-OPEC oil supply rises by 4.5 mb/d to reach 69.5 mb/d by 2025. As for OPEC, even though sanctions and economic distress have wiped out 2.5 mb/d of production from Iran and Venezuela since 2017, effective crude oil capacity rises by 1.2 mb/d to 34.1 mb/d. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: Assumes Iran remains under sanctions.\\n\\nGlobal oil capacity to rise by 5.9 mb/d by 2025. United States leads supply gains. \\n\\nIn this forecast, we have assumed that Iran remains under sanctions. If sanctions were to be eased, OPEC’s effective crude oil capacity could rise by an additional 1.7 mb/d in short order. \\n\\nAs the pace of non-OPEC growth slows and the call on OPEC rises, Middle East producers – with their relatively low cost reserves – take over from the United States as the leading source of supply growth from 2022 to 2025 (see Figure 2.2 ). Iraq and the UAE are poised to build capacity to fresh record highs and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will benefit from the resumption of flows from the Neutral Zone. Qatari condensate and NGL production will gain from further development of its massive gas resources in the North Field. By 2025, the call on OPEC crude is expected to reach 30.6 mb/d, 2 mb/d more than the group produced in early 2020. \\n\\nHowever, in the early part of the forecast, market management by producers is likely to play a role. For three years, Saudi Arabia and Russia have led a group of producers accounting for nearly half of global supply in a series of cuts that amounted to 2.1 mb/d in early 2020. That makes for ample spare capacity in OPEC. In 2025, spare capacity remains above 3 mb/d even with Iran remaining under sanctions.            \\n\\n> -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 mb/d\\n> OPEC Non-OPEC Total\\n> -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 US Brazil Guyana Iraq UAE Canada Biofuels Norway Saudi Kuwait Angola Nigeria Egypt Russia UK Colombia mb/d Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |39\\n> IEA.

Many are looking to rise to the challenge by announcing bold strategies to reduce the carbon intensity of their operations, albeit with targets that are usually long term and light on detail. \\n\\nLarge international oil companies (IOCs), especially in Europe, have taken the lead in embracing clean energy and are increasing investments in renewables such as biofuels, solar and wind. BP has laid out the boldest climate goals yet stating that it will achieve net zero emissions from its operations and from the oil and gas that it produces (including emissions from customer use of its products, known as scope 3 emissions) by 2050 or sooner. Repsol has made a comparable commitment by pledging to reach net zero emissions before 2050. Peers such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Equinor have announced targets for curbs, but none has promised net zero emissions from their overall activity. Several US majors also have targets, but these tend to be less ambitious. \\n\\nPublic pressure is often directed at the seven integrated oil and gas majors due to their relative transparency and activitist shareholders. But the industry is much larger: the majors account for 15% of global oil and gas production, 12% of reserves and 10% of estimated emissions from industry operations ( The Oil and Gas Industry in Energy Transitions [IEA, 2020]). \\n\\nHowever, NOCs – fully or majority-owned by national governments – account for well over half of global production and an even larger share of reserves and need to play their part. Since the oil price collapse in 2014-16, many of their governments have renewed commitments to reform and diversify their economies to decrease reliance on oil. \\n\\nSome are progressing better than others. For example, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have plans to stimulate other parts of the economy. They intend to invest in the generation of electricity from natural gas, renewables and nuclear to reduce carbon emissions.

Petrobras, which claims to have one of the world’s lowest emissions intensities of oil production, plans to spend USD 100 million a year over the next five years to further decarbonise production and an additional USD 70 million a year on research and development for decarbonisation and renewables. \\n\\nClean energy investments by oil and gas companies are increasing, albeit from a small percentage of the industry’s current overall spending. From a global oil supply perspective, the announced targets are unlikely to make a visible impact in this six year forecast. Demand for oil grows over the medium term (even though efficiency improvements and electric vehicles are causing the pace to slow) and producers are prepared to meet that increased requirement. Further ahead, the prospect of peak demand may in fact drive some in the industry to build up capacity and production as swiftly as possible while consumption is still expanding. \\n\\nRecognising that oil and gas production will be needed for decades to come, BP’s new CEO, Bernard Looney, echoed a wider industry sentiment when stating BP will remain in the oil and gas business \\\"for a very long time\\\". What is clear, is that with oil and gas still dominating the energy mix, carbon capture, storage and utilisation, and efforts to reduce emissions from operations need to be part of the clean energy solution. But that may not be easy while at the same time ensuring affordable energy and rewarding shareholders. \\n\\nEmissions reduction targets by selected international oil and gas companies \\n\\nCompany  Targets \\n\\nBP  Net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations and upstream production by 2050.

Higher conventional offshore investments will offset a further easing in shale activity. \\n\\nDuring 2019, spending on onshore projects, which accounted for over 70% of total upstream expenditure, fell for the first time in two years, according to Rystad Energy. Investment in US shale resources slipped 4%, a dramatic change to the trend that saw it more than double between 2016 and 2018. With subdued oil prices, the focus on capital discipline and investor returns intensified, leading independent operators to spend below the levels anticipated in their earlier outlooks. \\n\\nThe IEA US Shale Upstream Cost Index rose 2.9% in 2019, reflecting, amongst other factors, a shortage of skilled personnel and some equipment and supplies. Global upstream costs remained flat, at around 25% below the levels seen in 2014. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> *Preliminary, based on company reports.\\n\\nEasing investment in unconventional plays is just offset by a rebound offshore. \\n\\nThe offshore oil sector in 2019 saw increased spending (+3%) and more project approvals. According to Rystad Energy, USD 105 bn of offshore investment was approved, double the level in 2017 and 2018, with the majority of it to be spent on greenfield developments. Expenditure is focused in the Middle East and Latin America; particularly in Saudi Arabia and Brazil (see \\n\\nTable 2.1 ). Including the onshore, the volume of conventional oil resouces approved rose to 11 billion barrels. These new projects will add 2.2 mb/d to global production capacity to 2025. \\n\\nThere are clear signs that access to capital is becoming more difficult as investors, conscious of the challenges to the industry from the energy transition, raise their return requirements for oil projects. Access to financing and regulatory change was a reason for the delay of several final investment decisions (FID) in 2019, in particular for projects operated by smaller independent companies who are more vulnerable to capital market sentiment.          \\n\\n> 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020* USD billion Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |42\\n> IEA.

Long-term growth at risk from depressed exploration. \\n\\nOf the major IOCs, only ExxonMobil flagged a significant increase in its capital budget for 2020, although its CEO stated these plans could be adjusted if market developments were unsupportive. Exxon is making large investments in Guyana and continues to expand in the Permian. Chevron, Shell and BP have also ramped up output in the US shale patch, attracted by short-cycle developments and the low-risk operating environment. The growing preference for projects with less upfront capital expenditure and faster paybacks, for shale and also for the conventional sector, is not just a consequence of the 2014-16 price crash. These projects also make sense as they lower the risk that a shift in oil demand due to energy transitions could wipe out longer-term returns. \\n\\nDue to the lower price outlook several IOCs wrote down the value of some of their assets in 2019. Chevron wrote down USD 10.4 bn of asset value while Repsol, Shell, BP and Equinor also took impairement charges in excess of USD 2 bn each. Repsol indicated the lower value of its portfolio was related to new carbon reduction targets, hinting at the impact of the energy transition. While the majors reject the notion that they might be left with stranded assets, weaker growth in demand for oil is likely to add further pressure in the coming years. This may also partly explain the continued decline in the majors’ exploration expenditure, which has fallen for the last six years. While firms may be confident that they can monetise their current assets within the coming decades, the heightened uncertainty means that there is less incentive to increase their resource base. The majors’ average reserve life (proved reserves divided by annual production) fell to 11 years in 2019, having been on the decline since the 2014-16 price crash. ExxonMobil had bucked the general trend as its discoveries in Guyana and increased US shale acreage gave a sizeable boost to proved reserves. \\n\\nIn 2019, the US independent shale producers pledged to rein in spending to satisfy investor demands for returns rather than maximise production growth. They exceeded their promises and cut back spending by 14%, while focus on cost control and efficiency allowed them to meet their production targets. Guidance for 2020 suggests a further reduction in spending.

Ongoing concerns about the shale business model have severely impacted operator’s ability to access funding and led to an increasing number of bankruptcies. According to law firm Hayes and Boone, 42 North American E&P companies filed for bankruptcy in 2019, a 50% annual increase. However, the majors’ growing US shale footprint may mean investment is more stable as their large balance sheets allow them to better manage price volatility. Some majors indicated that their divestment programmes are partially to generate funds for expansion in the United States. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

In 2019, several high profile names committed to pull out of oil and gas and/or tighten their rules for making new investments in the sector. These include BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, the European Investment Bank, insurers Axa and Alliance and pension funds run by the Norwegian government and several American and European universities and cities. Overall, environmental campaign group 350.org reported that funds managing over USD 11 trillion have agreed to divest their fossil fuel holdings. While this is an impressive number, it is less clear what share of the total is related to oil and gas or the timeframe for withdrawing funds. In some cases, divestments relate specifically to certain assets, such as coal and Artic exploration, rather than the industry as a whole. \\n\\nReportedly, only half of the world’s major banks have made sustainable finance commitments and, according to 2019’s Banking on Climate Change report, 1 bank lending for oil and gas projects has increased since 2015 despite the growing pressure to do otherwise.

OPEC’s effective capacity returns to growth in 2020 after plunging 1.85 mb/d in 2019 when US sanctions slashed Iranian supply and Venezuela saw a further substantial production loss. We assume that US sanctions against Iran stay in place through the six-year period. The forecast includes the restart in 2020 of the Neutral Zone shared between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait whereas in previous oil market reports it was excluded. If Iran were released from sanctions, it could add a further 1.7 mb/d of capacity in short order. \\n\\nIraq, including the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), and the UAE continue to lead the gains in capacity and should remain comfortably in OPEC’s number two and three slots, respectively, through 2025. Both pumped at annual record highs in 2019, with Iraq at 4.7 mb/d and the UAE at 3.2 mb/d. Angola and Nigeria post the biggest declines in capacity, as ageing oil fields lose steam and investor enthusiasm, especially in Nigeria, is on the wane. On the other hand, producers in the Middle East are willing to spend substantial amounts to boost capacity by 1.6 mb/d as they expect stronger demand for their crude. Our estimates show that the call on OPEC crude rises to 30.6 mb/d in 2025 from 27.3 mb/d in 2020. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |45\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: Assumes Iran remains under sanctions.\\n\\nMiddle East dominates OPEC expansion effort. \\n\\n# Iraq, UAE set to break capacity records \\n\\nDespite the formidable security, financial and institutional challenges it faces, Iraq has managed to double production from 2.36 mb/d in 2010 to a record 4.7 mb/d in 2019. Exports have also doubled to nearly 4 mb/d. The People’s Republic of China (hereafter, “China”) and India both receive about 1 mb/d from Iraq, another 1 mb/d moves to Europe and the United States takes 0.4 mb/d. However, escalating tension between the United States and Iran spilled over into Iraq in early 2020, increasing its vulnerability as a supplier just as its strategic importance has grown. \\n\\nIn the medium term, heightened security concerns could make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity. Even so, its crude oil expansion is expected to be the largest within OPEC thanks to its vast reserves and strong economic incentives to boost output. Capacity is projected to grow by 600 kb/d to reach 5.5 mb/d in 2025. \\n\\nWhile there are myriad above-ground hurdles that can complicate the delivery of projects, Iraq has some of the lowest-cost resources in the world. Even before the January 2020 clashes between Iran and the United States in Iraq, widespread protests had posed a threat to oil fields and terminals although there was no material impact on operations.The Basra oil heartland in the south, where IOCs are managing mega-projects, will dominate the capacity building effort. By contrast, the northern Kirkuk oil fields and the capacity that is controlled by the KRG are expected to deliver modest growth. \\n\\nThe southern oil fields of Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair and Majnoon combined account for 60% of Iraq’s oil production. Prospects for boosting their capacity would improve if the ministry were to press ahead with the long-delayed Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP). The Basra Oil Co (BOC) has taken responsibility for the CSSP and put it out to tender. The first multi-billion dollar phase, expected to take at least three years to construct, aims to pipe 5 mb/d of treated seawater to fields across Basra and to Nassiriya.    \\n\\n> -0.2 00.2 0.4 0.6\\n> mb/d Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |46\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Oil is also continuing its plans for the multi-billion dollar Southern Iraq Integrated Project (SIIP). This is expected to boost output from the Nahr Bin Umar and Ratawi oil fields from current combined levels of roughly 80 kb/d to 500 kb/d. The revenue generated would finance the upgrading of southern infrastructure, including the Gulf export terminals. The SIIP also includes a water injection project (at this point separate from the CSSP) that would treat water from the Gulf and distribute it to the oil fields in the South. \\n\\nWater is not an urgent need at greenfields in the south such as Halfaya, which has fuelled much of the recent growth, and Majnoon, which is expected to pump more over the coming years. Halfaya is climbing towards its plateau output level of 400 kb/d and a third central processing facility is due to lift capacity to 450 kb/d at the field operated by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Majnoon, discovered by Petrobras in the 1970s, has been transformed from a battlefield into an oil field and now has the capacity to produce more than 200 kb/d. BOC operates the field following Shell’s departure in mid-2018, and is looking to boost output to 400 kb/d. A substantial drilling effort is gathering pace to underpin this expansion. \\n\\nWater is one of the biggest hurdles at Rumaila, Iraq’s largest oil field, currently producing 1.5 mb/d. Increasing production requires additional water handling and separation facilities. The 70-year-old field has a natural annual decline rate of more than 20%, so production has to be increased by around 300 kb/d each year to compensate. \\n\\nSo-called “national effort” fields in the south such as the 80 kb/d Nassiriya are also set for higher output. Baghdad has signed a contract for a drilling programme to raise output by 40 kb/d over the next two years. \\n\\nExport capacity in the south, due to rise from around 4 mb/d currently, should be enough to handle the anticipated production increase. To support its capacity-building efforts, Iraq has signed an initial agreement with Dutch company Boskalis to build an artificial island in the Gulf to raise export capacity by 3 mb/d and boost storage capacity by 6 mb from an existing 10 mb. In early 2020, shipments of Basra crude were running at around 3.3 mb/d. \\n\\nBaghdad is also striving to boost output from the northern fields, which were responsible for just under a fifth of Iraq’s production in 2019, primarily from the Kirkuk and Bai Hassan fields. Efforts have been frustrated by the 2014-17 battles with Islamic State as well as the dispute between the federal government and the KRG over the control of land and oil. Complicated geology has also hindered the development drive. \\n\\nProduction at Kirkuk slumped to around 500 kb/d in 2019 from 900 kb/d in 2001. The oil field, producing since the 1920s, is composed of three main geological formations, or domes: Khurmala, Baba and Avana. Khurmala straddles Erbil province and is administered by the KRG under a 2008 agreement with Baghdad. There are plans to raise Kirkuk’s production capacity to 1 mb/d, comprised of an increase of 170 kb/d at the Khurmala dome and 330 kb/d from elsewhere. The nearby Qayara field, operated by Sonangol, has a near-term production target of 60 kb/d, double the current level. \\n\\nAs for Kurdistan, although the KRG is still burdened with debt that piled up during its financial crisis after the 2014-16 oil price drop, its production has recovered to 480 kb/d. Output has risen to 175 kb/d at the Khurmala dome, operated by the KAR group, and the swift development of the Peshkabir field, operated by DNO, has helped make up for natural declines at Tawke. Production at DNO’s Taq Taq field has been in sharp decline, falling from 130 kb/d in 2014 to 10 kb/d in 2019. Output at the Gazprom Neft-operated Sarqala field has risen from 5 kb/d to 30 kb/d. Production at the heavy oil producing Shaikan field is relatively steady at 40 kb/d. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |47\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: Actual production from 2015-19; sustainable capacity thereafter.\\n\\nIraq and the UAE drive OPEC gains. \\n\\nThe UAE is also expected to deliver a substantial production capacity increase thanks to its secure operating environment and relatively low-cost resource base. Growth of 480 kb/d is forecast by 2025, with capacity rising to 4 mb/d, higher than Iran’s. In 2019, the UAE’s crude supply rose to a record 3.2 mb/d, up 180 kb/d year-on-year (y-o-y), making it OPEC’s third-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Recent growth was supported by spending on the offshore Umm Lulu and Satah al-Razboot (Sarb) fields, which are expected to produce 200 kb/d by 2023. \\n\\nThe climb towards 4 mb/d will require the expansion of the Exxon-operated Upper Zakum offshore field, one of the world’s largest. Output is around 750 kb/d and is expected to reach 1 mb/d by 2024. ExxonMobil has invested around USD 6.5 billion in Upper Zakum since it took a share in 2006. More near-term supply will come from offshore oil fields Ghasha, Dalma and Hail. As for the onshore, the Haliba field started up in 3Q19 and output is expected to reach 40 kb/d. Located along the Abu Dhabi-Oman border, it is operated by Al-Dhafra Petroleum, a joint venture between the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), Korea National Oil Corp and GS Energy. \\n\\nApart from Upper Zakum, ADNOC split its 700 kb/d offshore oil concession into three separate ventures: Lower Zakum, Umm Shaif and Nasr, and Sarb and Umm Lulu. Total secured a 5% stake in Lower Zakum and 20% in Umm Shaif/Nasr; while OMV acquired the final 20% stake in Sarb and Umm Lulu. ADNOC will retain a 60% stake in each. \\n\\nFor its onshore sector, which pumps around 1.8 mb/d of flagship Murban crude, ADNOC has secured foreign partners for a 40% share of the concession. The official aim is to boost Murban output beyond 1.8 mb/d and, to that end, ADNOC plans to lift production from the Bab field to 485 kb/d from around 420 kb/d currently. Total and BP both hold 10% of ADNOC Onshore, with GS, Inpex, CNPC and Zhenhua Oil securing minority stakes.                  \\n\\n> 01234562015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> South/Central North KRG\\n> Iraq\\n> 0123452015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025\\n> Murban Upper Zakum Others\\n> UAE Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |48\\n> IEA.

Iran was expected to rank as one of the world’s leading sources of supply growth before sanctions were imposed in 2018. The impact of the sanctions has been to cut effective capacity by 1.7 mb/d to around 2.1 mb/d. \\n\\nIran’s production of crude oil fell by 1.2 mb/d during 2019 to an average 2.36 mb/d, the lowest annual rate since 1988. Exports of crude and condensate fell by 1.4 mb/d to 0.8 mb/d on average. Production of crude recently has been hovering around 2.1 mb/d while exports of crude and condensate are 0.4 mb/d. \\n\\nLower wellhead production is likely to have led the National Iranian Oil Co to shut in more wells, especially at its more high-cost offshore fields, and complete maintenance at its mature oil fields. Shutting in output can be helpful for ageing oil fields as it will allow pressure to rebuild and make it easier for operations to restart. \\n\\nGiven the obstacles posed by the collapse of exports and the lack of foreign investment due to sanctions, Iran’s capacity building is now on ice. The previous round of international sanctions had already left the oil sector in urgent need of foreign cash and technology, particularly in enhanced oil recovery methods to sustain and raise output at older oil fields. \\n\\nChinese oil companies, at work in Iran since the early 2000s, have wound down operations to avoid US sanctions. CNPC and Sinopec have suspended investments in South Pars and Yadavaran. \\n\\nThe virtual absence of foreign investors has left Iran striving to move forward with projects already under development by local companies, especially the West Karun oil fields of Azadegan, Yadavaran and Yaran. These fields, which straddle the border with Iraq, will help to sustain capacity and drive future growth beyond the medium term. Target output for West Karun is 1 mb/d versus current flows of 300 kb/d. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

The strikes briefly halted over half its crude supply and wiped out almost all the world’s spare capacity: the Kingdom typically holds around 2 mb/d in reserve. Saudi Aramco’s ability to restore operations and maintain customer confidence was impressive. Production capacity recovered to the pre attack level of 12 mb/d by the end of November. Saudi capacity is now set to reach 12.25 mb/d in 2021 thanks to an end-2019 agreement to restart the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait. The return of production, shut for more than four years, is expected to be gradual and material volumes are not expected until later in 2020. Just before output was suspended, the offshore (mainly Khafji) and onshore (mostly Wafra) fields were pumping about 450 kb/d. \\n\\nFor years, Saudi Arabia has been bringing new projects online to make up for declines and enable older reservoirs in the 3.8 mb/d Ghawar onshore field to run at lower rates. Aramco is turning to higher cost offshore projects for that effort. To that end, the company has awarded USD 18 billion worth of contracts to boost capacity at the Marjan and Berri fields by a combined 550 kb/d. The 850 kb/d Zuluf field is also set for expansion. \\n\\nOnshore, the Khurais project reached capacity of 1.5 mb/d in 2019. This expansion, together with a robust drilling programme, will help make up for natural declines, including at Ghawar, the world’s biggest oil field. Saudi Arabia remains one of the world’s lowest cost oil producers at an average of USD 4/bbl. \\n\\nKuwait is spending more on expanding its crude oil production capacity, which is expected to rise by 280 kb/d during the six-year outlook to reach 3.14 mb/d. Apart from the Neutral Zone, which adds 250 kb/d, the northern Ratqa oil field near the border with Iraq, due to start pumping in the early part of the forecast period, supports the expansion effort. Heavy crude output from the field is expected to ramp up gradually to around 75 kb/d and Shell will help raise it towards a target of 270 kb/d. It will also manage a water project at onshore oil fields that will lift production. BP is expected to expand the Burgan field which could produce up to 2 mb/d from roughly 1.6 mb/d now. For decades, Kuwait has struggled to develop upstream projects because its parliament has been critical of foreign involvement. \\n\\n# Venezuela stabilises \\n\\nAfter two straight years with declines in excess of 0.5 mb/d, production in Venezuela may be stabilising. US financial sanctions, poor reservoir management and chronic underinvestment cut production to just 870 kb/d on average in 2019. This is just a quarter of the 3.4 mb/d peak level reached just before President Chavez took office in 1999. In this oil market report, we have assumed that following the 500 kb/d loss of actual production in 2019, output declines further in 2020 and then bottoms out at roughly 700 kb/d. We have held this level through the remainder of the forecast. \\n\\nReality, however, could look completely different. A turn-around of the political situation would provide the opportunity to rebuild the energy sector. Alternatively, if the situation worsens, the industry could collapse for an indeterminate period. \\n\\nOutput from mature conventional oil fields operated by Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) has plunged and upgraders managed by foreign joint venture partners in the vast Orinoco heavy oil belt have malfunctioned due to the stress of late payments, security, corruption and the difficulty of securing equipment. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |50\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nVenezuelan annual crude oil production plunges below 1 mb/d for first time since birth of OPEC. \\n\\nShut out of the US market by sanctions, PDVSA last year temporarily adopted a new blending strategy to optimise crude exports. Orinoco upgraders were converted to blending operations to churn out heavy Merey 16 rather than the synthetic crude previously produced. Since the start of 2020, the Petropiar facility, a joint venture between PDVSA and Chevron, is once again operating as a crude upgrader. PDVSA’s other upgraders are Petrocedeno, part owned by Total and Equinor; Petromonagas, part-owned by Rosneft and Petrosanfelix, wholly owned by PDVSA, that has been out of operation since last year. \\n\\nSo just how quickly could Venezuela rebuild should conditions allow? Before Chavez came to power, PDVSA was planning to boost production capacity to 5.5 mb/d by the mid 2000s by reorganising the company into a single integrated unit and opening up to foreign investment. Production did increase by nearly 900 kb/d in the four years to 1997 thanks to foreign investment and a disregard of the country’s OPEC output quota. \\n\\nThus if Venezuela’s diaspora of skilled oil workers return and investment capital were available, production could recover significantly over time. In the meantime, the Maduro government has looked to Russia and China to help revive the oil sector. \\n\\n# Ecuador leaves OPEC \\n\\nSeeking to boost revenue through higher output free from restrictions, Ecuador announced its departure from OPEC, but this had not been officially confirmed as we prepared this report. Therefore, Ecuador is included within OPEC in this report. Production capacity is set to inch towards 560 kb/d by the end of the forecast. Only marginal growth is expected from the Ishpingo Tambococha-Tiputini block in the Amazon rainforest. Three years after start-up, production has only reached 90 kb/d, but it is the highest producing area in the country. Situated in a UNESCO world biosphere reserve, the heavy crude-producing block contains around 20% of Ecuador’s total reserves of 8 billion barrels.                \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 mb/d Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |51\\n> IEA.

Angola and Nigeria lead the losses, while Libya is due to post modest growth. \\n\\nCapacity in Angola is set to fall by 160 kb/d to 1.27 mb/d by 2025 as operational and technical issues beset high-cost deep water oil fields. Production slumped to an average 1.39 mb/d in 2019 from a recent peak of 1.76 mb/d in 2015 and the decline would have been steeper if not for Total’s USD 16 bn Kaombo project that is pumping more than 200 kb/d. \\n\\nThe Angolan government hopes to stave off a collapse by offering sweeter upstream terms and this is meeting some success. Angola has recently awarded offshore exploration blocks to Eni, Total, BP and Equinor and another licensing round for onshore blocks is set for later in 2020. Seeking to expand its presence in the deep offshore, Total has secured a deal for two blocks in the Kwanza Basin. Four discoveries – Cameia, Mavinga, Bicuar and Golfinho – have been made so far. Total also plans to move ahead with the Zinia 2, Clov Phase 2 and Dalia Phase 3 projects in Block 17 that will sustain output from the Pazflor field that came online in 2011. \\n\\nEni has started up the offshore Agogo field just nine months after making the initial discovery. Situated in Block 15, Agogo is due to pump 20 kb/d. Its rapid start-up was due to its proximity to the Ngoma floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). Agogo will support oil shipped via the FPSO and sold as Sangos crude. Agogo is one of five discoveries in Block 15 made by Eni in less than two years. Production from the Agidigbo field will be fast-tracked to the Armada Olombendo FPSO and exported as Olombendo crude. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

As other producers in Africa seek to improve commercial terms, Nigeria plans to raise taxes on its deep water oil production which could make investments far less               \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 mb/d\\n> Nigeria Angola Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |52\\n> IEA.

Production rose 130 kb/d to 1.7 mb/d in 2019, the highest level since 2015, thanks to the start-up of the 200 kb/d Egina deepwater field, operated by Total, and a lull in militant attacks. \\n\\nTotal, however, is reportedly seeking to sell its 12.5% stake in deep water (OML) 118, which includes the Bonga field, as it rationalises its African portfolio. Output from the block is expected to rise whenever the Shell-operated Bonga Southwest project gets off the drawing board. However, the final investment decision on the project may be further delayed by uncertainty over commercial terms. Chevron, too, is reportedly seeking buyers for some of its Nigerian assets following a similar move by ExxonMobil in 2019. Shell and Chevron have already sold several blocks in recent years. Upstream spending has also been dwindling due to the lack of movement on the long-stalled Petroleum Industry Governance Bill, which aims to improve commercial terms and create a new national oil company. \\n\\nLibya’s production recovery stretched into a third year in 2019, with supply rising 120 kb/d to nearly 1.1 mb/d, the highest annual average since 2012. Capacity is expected to edge higher over the forecast period and reach 1.31 mb/d by the end of 2025. \\n\\nOf course this depends upon political stability and sufficient revenue, perhaps including foreign investment, to fund infrastructure repairs. At the time of publication of this oil market report, Libya was in the grip of civil unrest that pits the UN-backed Government of National Accord against the Libyan National Army (LNA) and production had virtually ground to a halt. \\n\\nUntil early 2020, production and exports were broadly stable with much crucial infrastructure under the control of the LNA. However, facilities in the west and southwest that are not secured by the LNA are more vulnerable and stable conditions at more remote fields are crucial to sustaining higher output. El Sharara, Libya’s largest oil field, experienced ups and downs during 2019, but at the end of the year was producing close to capacity at around 300 kb/d. The nearby El Feel was hit by air strikes, but was pumping roughly 70 kb/d by the end of last year. \\n\\nFirmly secured by the LNA, the Waha Oil Co, located in the Sirte basin in the northeast, is also key to further growth. Some of its infrastructure, producing around 300 kb/d, has suffered extensive damage from attacks. Crude from Waha is delivered to the Es Sider export terminal. A top priority is to repair damage to the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf export outlets. \\n\\nThere is some hope that IOCs will return to the country. Total has finalised a deal with National Oil Corp (NOC) for a minority stake in a promising set of oil blocks. Total will help NOC boost production by 180 kb/d at the North Gialo and NC 98 fields in the Waha Oil Co. Tatneft has resumed upstream operations after a gap of more than five years and Eni, BP and Gazprom also plan to restart exploration. \\n\\nCrude oil production in Algeria has been on the decline since peaking at 1.4 mb/d in 2007 and averaged 1.02 mb/d in 2019, the lowest since 2002. Capacity is expected to fall to 970 kb/d by the end of the forecast period. The new government, installed at the start of January, is facing an economic and political crisis triggered by falling oil and gas revenues. A new energy law, which features improved commercial terms and tax rates to attract investment, has also taken effect. For years, there has been a struggle to drum up interest from foreign firms, with companies complaining about tough commercial terms and red tape. \\n\\nProduction capacity in Gabon is set to slip to 190 kb/d by 2025, extending a decline from a peak of just below 400 kb/d in 1997. Ageing oil fields are seeing production slump due to a lack of Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |53\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\ndevelopment and long standing investors Total and Shell have sold off mature assets. Seeking to lure fresh spending, Gabon has opened a new licensing round that includes 12 shallow and 23 deep water blocks. \\n\\nEquatorial Guinea is expected to hold capacity steady after two offshore finds come online. Recent discoveries by Noble Energy and Kosmos Energy are expected to provide a brief boost before capacity dips to 120 kb/d for the remainder of the forecast period. Crude output peaked at 310 kb/d in 2004. OPEC’s smallest producer signed deals in January with companies including Noble Energy and Lukoil to develop oil exploration blocks. ExxonMobil intends to sell its holdings in the 90 kb/d Zafiro oil field as part of the disposal of USD 25 billion of global assets as it seeks to free up cash and focus on select mega-projects. \\n\\nNew discoveries and drilling programmes are expected to push production capacity in Congo to a peak of 380 kb/d in 2022-23. After sliding from 310 kb/d in 2010, output began to recover from 2017 on the back of production from deep-water fields such as Total’s Moho Nord and Eni’s Nene Marine that are helping to make up for losses at mature fields. In 2018, Congo awarded three production sharing contracts for offshore fields to Total, Kosmos and Perenco under the first phase of its latest licensing round. In the second phase, a consortium of Eni and Lukoil won two offshore blocks, while US-based Kosmos Energy won a single offshore block. Eni-Lukoil secured Marine XXXI and Marine XXIV and Kosmos snared Marine XXII. \\n\\nTable 2.2 Estimated sustainable OPEC crude production capacity* (mb/d) \\n\\n2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  2019-25 \\n\\nAlgeria  1.05  1.03  1.01  1.00  0.99  0.98  0.97  -0.08 \\n\\nAngola  1.43  1.43  1.43  1.40  1.37  1.32  1.27  -0.16 \\n\\nCongo  0.35  0.35  0.37  0.38  0.38  0.37  0.36  0.01 \\n\\nEcuador ****  0.55  0.55  0.55  0.56  0.56  0.56  0.56  0.01 \\n\\nEquatorial Guinea  0.12  0.12  0.13  0.12  0.12  0.12  0.12  0.00 \\n\\nGabon  0.22  0.22  0.21  0.21  0.20  0.20  0.19  -0.03 \\n\\nIran ***  2.10  3.80  3.80  3.80  3.80  3.80  3.80  1.70 \\n\\nIran w/sanctions  2.10  2.10  2.10  2.10  2.10  2.10  2.10  0.00 \\n\\nIraq  4.90  4.93  4.98  5.10  5.23  5.37  5.50  0.60 \\n\\nKuwait **  2.86  3.04  3.14  3.14  3.14  3.14  3.14  0.28 \\n\\nLibya  1.17  1.20  1.22  1.25  1.27  1.29  1.31  0.14 \\n\\nNigeria  1.83  1.83  1.80  1.77  1.75  1.71  1.67  -0.16 \\n\\nSaudi Arabia **  12.00  12.13  12.25  12.25  12.25  12.25  12.25  0.25 \\n\\nUAE  3.52  3.67  3.75  3.82  3.88  3.95  4.00  0.48 \\n\\nVenezuela  0.84  0.70  0.70  0.70  0.70  0.70  0.70  -0.14 \\n\\nTotal OPEC  32.94  34.99  35.34  35.49  35.63  35.75  35.84  2.90 \\n\\nOPEC /Iran sanctions  32.94  33.29  33.64  33.79  33.93  34.05  34.14  1.20   \\n\\n> *Assessed at end year. **Includes Neutral Zone starting from 2020. **In 2019, Iran at 2.1 mb/d reflects effective capacity. ****Ecuador to be included in non-OPEC in the next report.\\n\\n# OPEC condensates and NGLs \\n\\nProduction of condensate, other natural gas liquids (NGLs) and non-conventional resources is expected to increase by 211 kb/d to 5.7 mb/d by 2025 as Middle East OPEC countries make natural gas development a top priority. \\n\\nThe UAE will drive the growth as it presses on with an integrated gas strategy that aims to achieve self-sufficiency by 2030.

The scheme, due to produce 240 kb/d of NGLs and condensates, is now to be developed by Iranian contractor Petropars.

Growth is expected to ease further over the medium term unless higher oil prices unlock additional investments and resources. By 2025, total US oil production is forecast to reach nearly 20 mb/d, 2.5 mb/d higher than in 2019. The United States remains the largest contributor to non-OPEC growth in the medium term, accounting for 55% of the overall increase. Crude oil production rises 1.7 mb/d to 14 mb/d, led by higher light tight oil (LTO) output, primarily in the Permian Basin. Continued growth in natural gas production and new petrochemical capacity underpins gains of an additional 0.7 mb/d of natural gas liquids. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

As a result, the oil rig count dropped by a quarter to its lowest level in more than two years. \\n\\nEven though investments and the number of rigs drilling new wells fell fast, US oil output continued to grow as cost control and efficiency measures provided an offset. In particular, rig efficiency and productivity increased to record levels in most big shale basins. Operators have not only significantly reduced the unit costs of drilling and completing tight oil wells but are drilling more wells faster from a single location and drilling multiple wells to produce oil simultaneously from different shale layers.  \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> *Source :Rystad Energy.\\n\\nTight oil output rises to 10 mb/d, led by continued Permian expansion. \\n\\nMoreover, the average well is producing more oil and gas. Longer horizontal sections, more intensive fracturing and wider well-spacing have boosted productivity. The horizontal length of the average tight oil well drilled today is 60% greater than in 2012 and it uses three times more water and proppant. Operators are focusing activity on their most productive areas to generate larger and faster returns on investment. Across the main shale plays, 40% of wells drilled in 2012 were in these core areas; by 2019 this had increased to nearly 70%. \\n\\nWhile further efficiency and productivity improvements could be made in coming years, this will depend on technological breakthroughs and costs. It is possible that we will see a reversal in the trend over the medium term as some producers run out of core acreage and the most prolific areas in Bakken and the Eagle Ford mature. \\n\\nAn increasing number of new wells will be required to offset losses from the existing production base. Production from tight oil wells declines very rapidly after completion, often by as much as 70% within the first year. The decline is more severe for oil than for gas and natural gas liquids, resulting in increasing gas to oil ratios. A shift in investments from the Midland portion of the Permian to the gassier Delaware Basin has also played a part. Higher gas output is cutting into company profits as in some cases producers have to pay to get their gas taken away. In the last few years, several operators have seen fracture interference between existing production wells                    \\n\\n> 0246810 12 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 mb/d  US LTO production\\n> Midland Delaware Bakken Eagle Ford Niobrara Others\\n> 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 $/bbl  Wellhead breakeven prices (WTI)* Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |57\\n> IEA.

That shows up in a deceleration in per-foot productivity improvement, which has been one of the most significant factors behind the resilience of US tight oil production growth in recent years. The estimated ultimate recovery per well and per dollar spent is also tapering off. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

In the near-term, US LTO supply is likely to be hit the hardest. Producers must continuously drill new wells to sustain output and are under pressure to deliver positive cashflow. \\n\\nThis report uses a price assumption for modelling purposes of USD 60/bbl for Brent through to 2025. However, prices are highly volatile given the uncertainty surrounding the duration and impact of the epidemic and the response from OPEC+. Crude oil prices fell by roughly 25% since the start of 2020 to around USD 50/bbl for Brent in early March, with WTI USD 5/bbl lower. \\n\\nWhile WTI at USD 45/bbl is still sufficient to cover operating expenses at existing wells, for many companies prices have fallen below the threshold to increase activity. Following spending cuts of 14% in 2019, US independent oil producers  had already pledged to cut investments by another 10% in 2020. Lower prices might lead to further cost cutting for the heavily indebted shale industry. \\n\\nAccording to Rystad Energy, WTI breakeven prices for shale acreage generally lie in the range of USD 40-50/bbl with the best locations coming in below USD 20/bbl. For all wells, Rystad estimates           \\n\\n> 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 000 2009 2014 2019 kboe/well\\n> Permian\\n> EUR/well (LHS) EUR/$ (RHS)\\n> 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 2009 2014 2019 boe/$\\n> Eagle Ford\\n> 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 2009 2014 2019\\n> Bakken Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |58\\n> IEA.

Wellhead breakeven prices were on average USD 10/bbl lower. \\n\\nUS LTO price sensitivities \\n\\nThe response of shale production to different prices is critical, as it will play a key role in balancing the market over the medium term. If prices hover around USD 60/bbl, LTO output is expected to rise by 2.2 mb/d to around 9.9 mb/d in 2025. Should prices for any extended period veer away from this level, however, producers are expected to respond accordingly. As an illustration, a price of USD 80/bbl throughout our forecast period could result in output rising by as much as 4.3 mb/d over the same period. Alternatively, a price of USD 40/bbl would cause LTO output to decline from 2021 onwards. \\n\\n## Gulf of Mexico set for further gains \\n\\nWith many developments set to come online, crude oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico is expected to continue to grow over the medium term. Output rises from 1.9 mb/d in 2019 to 2.15 mb/d in 2025. In 2020, gains will primarily come from projects still in the ramp-up phase. In particular, Shell’s Appomattox project that started up ahead of schedule in May 2019 still has some way to go before reaching its 175 kb/d capacity. Increases will also come from Hess’ Stampede and Chevron’s Big Foot fields that have yet to reach plateau levels. \\n\\nLater on, Shell’s 100 kb/d Vito project will provide a substantial boost. First production is expected in 2021. Further gains will come from BP’s 140 kb/d Mad Dog Phase 2 project, scheduled to see first oil by the end of 2021. Also expected online in 2021 is BP’s Thunder Horse South Expansion phase 2 that will boost output by 50 kb/d. \\n\\nIn 2019, two significant new developments in the Gulf were sanctioned. In August, Murphy Oil greenlighted its King’s Quay project that will have a production capacity of up to 80 kb/d and is set to start up by mid-2022. Chevron gave the go-ahead for the deep-water Anchor development in December 2019 and the project will produce 75 kb/d of crude oil and 28 mcf/d of natural gas from 2024.         \\n\\n> 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 mb/d\\n> $80/bb\\n> $70/bb\\n> $60/bb\\n> $50/bb\\n> $40/bb\\n> Base Case Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |59\\n> IEA.

Even so, output for 2019 as a whole was up 140 kb/d versus 2018 with production setting a fresh record by the end of the year. As production curtailments in Alberta ease further and new pipeline and rail capacity come on stream from 2020, growth is expected to continue. Oil supply is forecast to expand by 0.5 mb/d over the 2019-25 period, although this is significantly lower than the 1.4 mb/d seen in 2013-19. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nNear-term incremental pipeline capacity to allow for higher supply but more is required. \\n\\nGrowth is mostly concentrated in the near term, with longer term projects put on hold due to concerns about price volatility linked to takeaway capacity constraintsand climate risk. In 2020, optimisation projects on a number of lines will add more than 200 kb/d of pipeline capacity and by year-end the completion of Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement will allow another 370 kb/d of oil to move to the United States. \\n\\nThe additional takeaway capacity will allow the ramp-up of recently completed projects as well as further debottlenecking and optimisation of existing facilities. Notably, Phase G of Cenovus’s Christina Lake facility will add 50 kb/d of production in 2020; Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) will bring on Kirby North in 2020; and Suncor plans to complete the 40 kb/d Meadow Creek West by 2023. Debottlenecking projects will also add capacity at ConocoPhillips’ Surmont project. \\n\\nIn the longer term, growth slows considerably. Local opposition and legal challenges have delayed major pipeline projects needed to absorb Western Canada’s production potential, and companies seem reluctant to sanction new projects until additional capacity from either Keystone XL or Trans Mountain can be brought online. Imperial Oil put on hold its Aspen project after government production curtailments were put in place. \\n\\nIn the offshore sector, production is forecast to increase by 60 kb/d from 265 kb/d in 2019 to 325 kb/d in 2025. The bulk of the increase is expected in 2020 from ExxonMobil’s Hebron field, even though the project had already reached capacity of 150 kb/d at the start of the year.

First oil is expected in 2023, with an expected peak production rate of 75 kb/d in 2025. Equinor is planning to make a decision this year on  whether to develop the deep-water Bay du Nord offshore project in which it holds a 65% stake. The project, which will target nearly 300 million barrels of oil reserves, could come online by 2025. \\n\\n# Mexican decline slows but growth target looks elusive \\n\\nDespite an anticipated boost in the near term, Mexico’s long term oil production decline is not expected to be reversed before 2025. A shift in focus towards short cycle developments onshore and in the shallow waters and away from deepwater and joint venture projects means that in the longer term, new project developments outlined so far will not produce enough to offset declines from mature fields. Based on current plans, total oil supply is seen falling by 150 kb/d over the period to 2025, to 1.8 mb/d (1.6 mb/d crude). While a marked improvement from the decline of more than 960 kb/d seen in 2013-19, output is expected to fall short of the government’s goal of lifting crude oil production to 2.6 mb/d by 2024. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nMexican decline slows, but 2024 target looks elusive. \\n\\nMexican oil production has been on a downward slope since peaking in 2004, and the largest fields Ku-Maloob-Zaap and Cantarell are expected to see further declines in the medium term. Nevertheless, increased investment is starting to pay off. Pemex announced the development of 20 priority fields as its main strategy to increase oil production in the near term, targeting output from these fields of more than 300 kb/d by 2021. Production will also be supported by the start-up of Eni’s Area 1 that includes the Amoca, Tecoalli and Mizdon fields. \\n\\nThere will also be growth from the Talos Energy-operated Zama and Hokchi Energy’s Hokchi oil fields, both discovered in 2017 after the sector was opened up to private players. In December 2019, Pemex announced it had found a huge oil deposit in Tabasco that could yield 500 mb of crude, its largest discovery since 1987. Even so, the suspension of competitive oil auctions open to private and foreign oil companies and the cancellation of auctions to pick joint venture partners for Pemex will make it difficult to grow substantially.             \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014 2019 2024 mb/d\\n> Other Producing Cantarell Ku-Maloob-Zaap New Developments Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |61\\n> IEA.

Total output will surpass 4 mb/d in 2025. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nProlific pre-salt deposits underpin sharp rise in Brazilian oil output. \\n\\nIn its updated five-year business plan that extends through 2024, Petrobras reduced its capital expenditures to USD 75.7 bn in 2020-24, down 10% from the USD 84.1 bn planned for 2019-2023. As in the previous plan, Petrobras intends to spend the bulk of its investments in the upstream, with 85% of the total earmarked for exploration and production, mainly to develop its prolific pre-salt deposits. Petrobras expects its own oil production to rise from 2.2 mb/d in 2020 to 2.9 mb/d in 2024,  not taking into account potential divestments. Significant gains will also come from IOCs that are increasing their presence, often in partnership with Petrobras. The largest increases are expected to come from Shell, Total, CNOOC and CNPC. \\n\\nTo fuel growth, Petrobras intends to deploy 13 new FPSOs in the next five years, of which seven - P-70 (Atapu), Carioca (Sepia), Guanabara (Mero-1), Almirante Barroso (Buzios-5), Sepetiba (Mero-2), Anita Garibaldi (Marlim-1) and Ana Neri (Marlim-2) – have been contracted already. The company is currently tendering for three more units – Mero-3, Itapu and Parque das Baleias – with another three FPSOs to enter operation by 2024, including Mero-4 and Sergipe-Alagoas Deepwater. \\n\\nIn early February, Petrobras announced it is fast tracking developments at the Buzios field, looking to contract for two additional FPSOs this year. Buzios-6 and Buzios-7 are expected to have a handling capacity of at least 180 kb/d each and could come online as early as 2024 and 2025, respectively. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Equinor, ExxonMobil and Galp Energia are moving ahead with their Bacalhau (previously known as Carcara) development. It was declared to be commercial late in 2019 and a 220 kb/d FPSO is reportedly being contracted for the development. This will be the largest such           \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 mb/d\\n> Offshore Other\\n> Santos basin Other\\n> Mero\\n> Iara\\n> Búzios\\n> Lula\\n> Campos basin\\n> Onshore Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |62\\n> IEA.

The consortium plans to bring onstream a second FPSO, possibly as large as the first one, with output expected between 2026 and 2028. \\n\\nEfforts are also being made to  stem output declines in the mature Campos Basin. In early January, Petrobras announced it would invest USD 8 bn over the next six years to revitalise operations in the mature Barracuda-Caratinga field. Petrobras had already said it intends to invest about USD 20 bn in the Campos Basin over the next five years, including exploration work at newly acquired blocks. Investments will be split between the Marlim, Marlim Sul, Marlim Leste, Roncador, Albacora, Albacora Leste, Tartaruga Verde and the Barracuda-Cartatinga fields, all in steep decline currently. \\n\\n# Guyana growth offsets Latin American declines \\n\\nAs for the rest of Latin America, oil supply is expected to rise by 380 kb/d to 2.2 mb/d by 2025. \\n\\nGuyana will be the key source of growth, as ExxonMobil, Hess and CNOOC plough ahead with new field developments in the Straebroek, Canje and Kaieteur Blocks offshore blocks. In early 2020, Exxon announced its  16th discovery on the Staebroek Block, raising the estimated recoverable resource to more than 8 billion barrels oil equivalent. \\n\\nThe Liza Phase 1 development achieved first oil in December 2019 and will produce up to 120 kb/d utilising the Liza Destiny FPSO. The Liza Unity FPSO, which will be employed for the second phase of the Liza development and will have a production capacity of 220 kb/d, is under construction and expected to start production by mid-2022. \\n\\nPending government approvals and project sanctioning of a third development, production from the Payara field north of the Liza discoveries could start as early as 2023, reaching an estimated 220 kb/d. The consortium has said that five FPSOs could take Guyana’s total production to 750 kb/d by 2025. \\n\\nGrowth will also come from Argentina , where significant investments are being made by Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and state-backed YPF in the Vaca Muerta shale play. Exxon last year kicked off a major long-term development of its onshore Bajo del Choique-La Invernada block in the Vaca Muerta shale play in the Neuquen province. Exxon plans to drill 90 wells over the next five years and produce 55 kboe/d. A possible second phase could see output boosted to 75 kboe/d. Total output rises 70 kb/d over the period. LTO production expands by 150 kb/d to 250 kb/d in 2025, more than offsetting declines at conventional fields. \\n\\nIn contrast, production is expected to decline in Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago on a dearth of new discoveries and new project approvals. In a push to turn the tide and attract new investments, Colombia held two oil auctions in 2019. Ecopetrol, the largest oil producer, is also planning to boost exploration and upstream capex for 2020, but is dedicating a larger share of investments to international developments (US Permian and Brazil offshore). \\n\\nIn September 2019, the government decided to maintain a moratorium on fracking. Colombia has the continent's second-highest estimated non-conventional reserves of up to 7 billion barrels (behind Argentina) but the government has not yet given the green light to exploit them because of environmental concerns. \\n\\nFollowing declines of 35 kb/d over the 2013-19 period, production in Trinidad and Tobago falls by a further 30 kb/d to 50 kb/d by 2025.

All rights reserved.\\n\\n# Mature North Sea rebounds \\n\\nIn recent years, production from the North Sea has stabilised at around 3 mb/d, which is less than half the level seen when regional output peaked in 2000. Healthy growth of 490 kb/d in the early part of the forecast period will see flows reach 3.5 mb/d, the highest since 2010, thanks largely to Norway’s giant Johan Sverdrup field, which started up in 2019. From 2024 onwards North Sea growth will be overwhelmed by steep declines in base production, although there are several identified opportunities that could be sanctioned and online before the end of the forecast period. However, for the most part, these are relatively small field tie-backs or plateau extensions. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nNorwegian projects Johan Sverdrup and Johan Castberg spur modest North Sea revival. Steep declines in base production overwhelm growth by 2025. \\n\\nNorway’s medium term growth is assured as production from Johan Sverdrup is expected to reach 660 kb/d after phase 2 comes online in 2022. Norway’s other medium term project start-ups, such as the redevelopment of the Tor field, Yme and Martin Linge, are relatively small. The exception is Equinor’s Johan Castberg field, due onstream in 2022, which will add 170 kb/d. Production is expected to peak at 2.3 mb/d in 2023 before returning to steep decline at the end of the forecast period. Overall, output is 350 kb/d higher in 2025. The potential for more growth further out depends on exploration and appraisal activity. While this was stepped up in 2019, with 57 wells drilled and 17 discoveries made, it is several years since there was a significant find in Norwegian acreage. \\n\\nWith few sources of growth for UK oil production on the table, 2020 looks likely to be the only year when production rises in the medium term. To 2025, flows are set to fall by 230 kb/d to 910 kb/d. Independent and private-equity backed firms continue to increase their footprint but there has been little focus on exploration, with only a modest pick-up in activity from the decades-low level seen in 2018, according to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA).             \\n\\n> 012345671971 1977 1983 1989 1995 2001 2007 2013 2019 2025 mb/d\\n> Denmark\\n> UK\\n> Norway Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |64\\n> IEA.

However, production did rise to a seven year high of 420 kb/d. Increased condensate output associated with huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Western Australia were largely responsible but crude from Woodside’s Greater Enfield project also contributed to total gains of 75 kb/d. The continued ramp-up and expansion of LNG projects will help Australia to grow further in 2020-21, but \\n\\nMature North Sea preparing for transition \\n\\nWith high awareness of climate concerns in Norway, Equinor has been keen to stress the steps it has taken to make new developments compatible with a lower carbon world. The Johan Sverdrup platform is supplied with electricity by underwater cables linked to the mainland and Norway’s mostly hydroelectrically powered grid, and is therefore fuelled with renewable energy as opposed to gas or diesel. According to Equinor, this puts the carbon intensity of Johan Sverdrup production at 0.7 kg CO2/bbl, around 200 times better than the global average. \\n\\nEquinor is connecting several of its existing fields to hydro and wind-generated electricity with the aim to reduce the net emissions from its operations in Norway to zero in 2050. With further targets to halve the carbon intensity of its global production, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, Equinor one of the leaders in its peer group and the company states that this will allow it to remain competitive as demand shifts to lower carbon energy. However, the company faces criticism for continuing the development of conventional oil and gas projects that are expected to produce for decades to come. \\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the OGA has also called for increased electrification of production facilities to reduce the carbon intensity of output. BP, Total and Shell are together conducting feasibility studies in the Central North Sea, but without Norway’s hydro-fuelled grid and existing power-links to the mainland this may be a more challenging economic prospect. Although the government has committed to a national emissions target of zero by 2050 and in 2019 halted shale exploration activity, there are no signs that it would like to deter other upstream investments and the United Kingdom continues to have an attractive fiscal regime. \\n\\nThe OGA has been granted funds specifically to allow it to work with the government and industry to facilitate platform electrification and has been vocal about the need for operators to use their technical experience and find innovative ways to adapt to the energy transition. Indeed, this may be even more relevant for the smaller players to prove that they are attractive investments. \\n\\nThe IEA estimates that the greenhouse (GHG) emissions from the oil and gas industry’s operations account for 15% of the global total. The IOCs have recognised the importance of reducing methane leaks as this is a very potent GHG (one tonne of methane is equivalent to 30 tonnes of CO2). While North Sea operations have relatively low methane emissions, there are potential risks of leaks from more mature infrastructure and challenges to accurately measure the scale of the issue. Again, Equinor appears to be leading the pack having strengthened procedures to detect and reduce methane emissions at its platforms. According to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, at 0.03% Equinor’s methane intensity for its upstream and midstream operations is around 10% of the industry average. It is hoped that others will follow and BP have already announced plans to install methane measurement equipment at its major oil and gas processing sites by 2023.

Overall, output will end the forecast period only 25 kb/d higher than in 2019. Exploration activity did recover last year, and the successful appraisal of Santos’ Dorado prospect may result in its approval in 2020. Dorado could add up to 100 kb/d of liquids later in the forecast period. Elsewhere in Australasia, activity levels are depressed. With no new developments tabled, New Zealand’s oil output will halve to 15 kb/d in 2025. \\n\\n# Steep declines and investment slump sees Asia drop further \\n\\nWith its ageing oil fields and investments increasingly geared towards gas, Asia accounts for the largest output declines over the medium term. Oil production, already down 780 kb/d over the 2010-19 period, is set to fall by a further 575 kb/d by 2025. The largest declines are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Thailand. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: Including non-conventional oil production, excluding biofuels.\\n\\nSteep declines at mature fields and dearth of new projects sees Asian oil output slump further. \\n\\nIndonesia ’s oil production is on a steady downward trajectory due to a lack of investment in the upstream sector. Output declined by 4% in both 2018 and 2019. At 735 kb/d in 2019 crude and condensate production fell short of the government’s target of 775 kb/d. Total oil output is forecast to drop another 165 kb/d by 2025, to 600 kb/d. Following a small boost expected in 2020, \\n\\nMalaysian crude oil production is forecast to resume declines. By 2025, total oil supply is 120 kb/d lower than in 2019. Near term growth comes from the completion of Sabah Shell Petroleum‘s phase 2 of its Gumusut-Kakap project that will increase the production of key export crude, Kimanis, by an estimated 50 kb/d. \\n\\nIndian production also failed to hit government targets in 2019, falling by 40 kb/d, or 5%, on average due to increased water cut at a number of wells. Delays in getting the KG-DWN-98 project off the ground, and a scaling back of the FPSO’s oil processing capacity from 90 kb/d to 50 kb/d, have curbed growth compared with earlier expectations. That said, state-controlled Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India (OIL) have announced plans to invest around USD 58 billion by 2023 in oil and gas exploration and production activities in a bid to boost output.         \\n\\n> 01234567892015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d  Other\\n> Australia\\n> Thailand\\n> Viet Nam\\n> Malaysia\\n> Indonesia\\n> India\\n> China Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |66\\n> IEA.

Thailand ’s oil production is expected to fall by 100 kb/d, to 325 kb/d (including ethane) while Viet Nam ’s oil output drops by 35 kb/d, to 190 kb/d. \\n\\nIn contrast, the outlook for Chinese production continues to improve as companies step up efforts to increase domestic output in order to enhance oil supply security. State-producers, CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC, which account for the bulk of China’s oil production, lifted upstream spending by 30% in 2018, to USD 45.5 bn, with a further 18% increase planned for 2019. As a result, domestic crude oil output rose by 50 kb/d last year, reversing declines in place since 2016. In the longer term, aging oil fields will cap further upside. We expect crude production to revert back to the long term decline path by the mid-2020s and in 2025 output is expected to be 280 kb/d lower than in 2019. Rising coal-to-liquids production could offset the decline however, so that total Chinese oil supply holds steady at around 3.9 mb/d through the medium-term. \\n\\n# Africa struggles to get projects off the ground \\n\\nWith the exception of Senegal, where projects are moving apace, technical problems and delays in bringing new projects online continue to derail growth plans in Africa. New projects are nevertheless expected to offset declines at mature assets with production rebounding to 2019 levels of 1.5 mb/d by 2025. \\n\\nIn Uganda , a FID on the Lake Albert oil project that is being developed by Total, CNOOC and Tullow Oil has yet again been delayed by a series of tax and other disputes. Work was suspended last August, but in December the Ugandan government announced it had reached a tax resolution with the consortium that could pave the way for a FID this year on the project that includes a crude export pipeline to the Tanzanian coast. Output of up to 230 kb/d from the Tilenga and Kingfisher fields is expected to start up in 2024. \\n\\nAn FID is also expected in 2020 for the proposed South Lokichar project in Kenya . In the first phase, Tullow Oil and its partners aim to produce 60-80 kb/d of oil that will be shipped to the port of Lamu on the Indian Ocean. The full development plan sees production reaching 100 kb/d during the second half of the decade. The consortium exported its first trial crude cargo last August from the pilot scheme already in place. Around 2 kb/d of Kenyan crude is still being trucked by road from South Lokichar to Mombasa. \\n\\nSenegal ’s first oil development, Sangomar, which received its FID in January, is expected to start up in early 2023. The offshore field, previously known as SNE, is being developed by Woodside, Cairn Energy, Far and Senegal's state-owned Petrosen. It is expected to produce up to 100 kb/d from an FPSO. \\n\\nIn contrast, Ghana ’s growth prospects have been derailed by technical problems and delays. Output is now expected to decline by 25 kb/d to 175 kb/d in 2025. In a 2019 investor update, Tullow Oil, Ghana’s largest oil producer, announced that it had been struggling with mechanical issues at its Jubilee field and a delay in completing a well at the TEN offshore field. The company significantly pared back its production guidance for the next few years. The growth outlook has also been affected by delays to Aker Energy’s proposed Pecan project after its most recent development plan proved to be unworkable. The project was targeting first oil in 2022 through a 110 kb/d FPSO. Aker is now looking to simplify the technical concept and reduce development costs of the project which holds resources of 450-550 mb.

In the longer term, production is expected to see a marginal decline if prices stay at current levels and the tax system remains unchanged. Total oil output is forecast to reach a peak of 11.9 mb/d in 2022 before going into gradual decline. Overall, Russian oil supply falls 210 kb/d by 2025, to 11.4 mb/d. Crude oil and condensates output slips from 11.25 mb/d in 2019 to 11 mb/d by the end of the forecast period. \\n\\nDespite an active OPEC+ market management policy, Russian oil production has increased in recent years. Output rose by 1.2 mb/d over the 2010-19 period and as much as 260 kb/d over the past two years, firmly establishing Russia as the world’s second largest oil producer. The near term outlook is clouded by uncertainty over the duration of the OPEC+ deal. Russia has pledged to reduce its crude oil production by 300 kb/d below October 2018 levels through March 2020. If the deal stays in place through to the end of the year, output is likely to hold steady in 2020. \\n\\nProduction is expected to bounce back if the deal ends, however. At the start of 2020, output was 155 kb/d below the all-time peak reached at the end of 2018 as companies shut in production and put on hold new greenfield developments. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

For example, further gains are expected to come from Rosneft’s Suzun, Kondinskoe, Srednebotuobinskoe (Tass-Yuryakh), Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoe greenfields as well as from East Messoyakha that it is developing with Gazpromneft. Gains will also come from the Kuyumba field that is set to reach peak production of 60 kb/d at the same time, and from Tagul that is still ramping up towards its 90 kb/d capacity target. Rosneft has brought Russkoe, a new hard-to-recover oilfield, online at the end of 2018. Production will reach 130 kb/d by the mid-2020s. \\n\\nLukoil is also focusing on hard-to-recover reserves, which receive significant tax breaks, and expects production from its Yaregskoye and Usinskoye fields to ramp up over the next few years,              \\n\\n> 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 mb/d\\n> Brownfields Greenfields Condensate Other NGLs Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |68\\n> IEA.

In West Siberia, the Imilorskoe field, also condsidered a hard-to recover oil field eligble for special tax rates, could add furhter growth. \\n\\nThe company also has a major offshore focus on the Caspian Sea, where the existing Filanovsky and Yuri Korchagin fields are increasing output as new stages of their development are brought online. Output from Korchagin rose by 21% y-o-y in 2019 and a third stage of Filanovksy was launched last November. The nearby Grayfer field could add an additional 25 kb/d from 2023. Lukoil is looking to expand gas condensate production in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District and started pilot production at the Yuzhno-Messoyakhskoye gas condensate field late last year. \\n\\nFinally, GazpromNeft continues to ramp up production at its Arctic fields that includes Prirazlomnoye, Novy Port and Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye. Output at East Messoyakha is expected to peak at 120 kb/d in the early 2020s. The use of multi-lateral horizontal wells has helped to overcome difficult geological conditions, and the economics of the field have been enhanced by export duty concessions that will run to 2024. Gazpromneft plans to bring West Messoyakha online by 2021. \\n\\nCompanies are also expected to manage the natural decline of existing fields using increasingly complex recovery techniques. Increased drilling, in particular of horizontal wells, has enabled producers to stem declines at mature fields in West Siberia. \\n\\nOil minister Novak, meanwhile, warned that oil production in Russia, which has enough reserves of crude to sustain current production for over 50 years, could decline if the tax system remains unchanged. Russian oil is taxed at a rate of around 70% of revenues, and as much as 85% for Western Siberian fields. These are are amongst the highest rates in the world. According to Novak, much of the country’s reserves cannot be developed economically under the current tax regime. Like many other oil producers, Russia depends heavily on revenues from crude oil and gas development. The Finance Ministry has repeatedly opposed lowering taxes on the oil industry. \\n\\n# Caspian producers \\n\\nIn the Caspian region, the biggest gains will come from Kazakhstan , where international consortia have launched a number of projects to shore up output. Most notably, Chevron’s Future Growth Project at Tengiz will bump up the field’s capacity by 260 kb/d to 850 kb/d in 2023. In 2019, partners in the Eni-led Karachaganak gas and condensate development took an FID on a USD 5 bn gas injection compressor project, the last of a series of investments aimed at extending the duration of the plateau phase. As for the offshore Kashagan field, which has fuelled growth in recent years, output reached a record level of 390 kb/d by end-2019, higher than the nameplate capacity of 370 kb/d. According to the Ministry of Energy, expansion projects could lead to an increase in field output to 420 kb/d in 2022 and 500 kb/d in 2027. Overall, Kazkahstan’s total oil production is forecast to rise by 100 kb/d over the forecast period to reach 2.04 mb/d in 2025. \\n\\nIn Azerbaijan , production is expected to see continued declines until 2023 as output from the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) complex falls further. ACG production, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of Azeri oil supply, averaged 535 kb/d in 2019, down from 585 kb/d in 2018 and 835 kb/d in 2010. Capacity is expected to rise when the new Azeri Central East platform comes on line in 2023. BP and its partners sanctioned the project last April, planning to spend USD 6 billion to add 100 kb/d of capacity. Azeri output is expected to rebound to 740 kb/d by 2025. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply   \\n\\n> PAGE |69\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nOil supply in Uzbekistan, meanwhile, will get a boost from a new 30 kb/d gas-to-liquids plant that will start up by the end of 2020 or early in 2021. The plant will process 3.6 billion cubic meters of gas to produce synthetic jet fuel, naphtha, LPG and Euro5 specification diesel. \\n\\n# Qatar to fuel Middle East growth \\n\\nQatar will lead net growth in the Middle East of 190 kb/d over the forecast period, thanks to further development of condensates from the North Field. Its total oil supply is due to rise to 2.1 mb/d by 2025, an increase of 140 kb/d. Qatar, the world's second largest LNG supplier after Australia, announced plans to raise its liquefaction capacity by nearly two-thirds to 126 million tonnes by 2027. That means adding six new trains to its existing 14 over time, which will also raise NGL supply. The original four-train expansion was to produce some 260 kb/d of condensate, 11 000 tons per day of LPG, and 4,000 t/d of ethane. However, a slump in international LNG prices might push back the full development. \\n\\nIn 2017, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world’s biggest gas field that it shares with Iran, where it is known as South Pars. Qatar’s crude production of around 600 kb/d is expected to stay broadly steady over the next six years. \\n\\nOman , which, as part of the OPEC+ deal agreed to reduce crude oil production, is expected to see a 50 kb/d increase in supply by 2025 split fairly evenly between crude and condensates. Condensate supply received a boost from BP’s Khazzan tight gas field, which is producing 35 kb/d of liquids. Output is expected to rise to 50 kb/d after a further phase of development, the Ghazeer project, starts up in 2021. Yemen could see output edge up by 25 kb/d to 95 kb/d by 2025. We have assumed there will be no change to supply in Syria , where conflict continues. \\n\\n# Biofuels \\n\\nGlobal conventional biofuel production in 2019 was 2.8 mb/d, up 6% on 2018. The forecast has been revised upwards since last year’s report, with production expected to grow by around 490 kb/d to reach 3.3 mb/d in 2025. Biofuels are anticipated to account for around 4.5% of road transport energy demand by the end of the forecast. This more optimistic outlook is primarily due to robust growth prospects in emerging economies in Asia, Brazil and stronger market prospects for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) 2 in the United States and Europe. \\n\\nStrengthened policy support for domestically produced biofuels in China, India and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries has been introduced as a means of offsetting some crude oil and petroleum product imports. Rising road transport fuel demand, combined with new biofuel policy initiatives, stimulates increased biofuel production and consequently Asia provides half of forecast production growth. These countries are also strengthening policy support to boost demand for nationally important agricultural commodities. \\n\\nWorld fuel ethanol production in 2019 grew almost 4% year-on-year to 2 mb/d. Over the forecast period average annual growth of 2% will see output reach just over 2.2 mb/d by 2025. Growth is principally driven by Brazil and China. Combined biodiesel and HVO production increased 13% in 2019 versus 2018 levels, to 820 kb/d. Over the next five years, average annual growth of 4% is anticipated, with production reaching around 1.1 mb/d in 2025. Market expansion is driven by     \\n\\n> 2Known as “renewable diesel” in North America. Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |70\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nsupportive policies in the United States, Brazil and some ASEAN countries. Over the forecast period HVO production grows as much as biodiesel. \\n\\nThe United States and Brazil were the largest biofuel producers in 2019. Together they are anticipated to account for almost 45% of output growth over the period to 2025, and provide around two-thirds of production at the end of the forecast period. \\n\\n> Note: Biofuel production is the sum of ethanol, biodiesel and HVO. “Ethanol” refers to fuel ethanol only; “biodiesel” refers to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biodiesel.\\n\\nUnited States and Brazil continue to dominate market. \\n\\n## Overview of key biofuel markets \\n\\nIn the United States , ethanol production decreased slightly to 1.02 mb/d in 2019. Output is forecast to broadly stabilise at this level, with 1.06 mb/d anticipated in 2025. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) 3 is the key federal policy mechanism supporting US biofuel consumption, and corn ethanol has now reached its statutory limit under the policy. Nevertheless, ongoing process improvements and technical modifications at existing plants will increase capacity to an extent, and utilisation is high. \\n\\nBlending gasoline with 10% ethanol (known as E10) is standard practice. However, a slight contraction of gasoline demand over the forecast period will moderately reduce domestic ethanol consumption. Nevertheless, increased exports are expected to keep production stable. Fuel ethanol exports reached a record 112 kb/d in 2018, before a slight reduction in 2019. The forecast assumes a resumption of growth from expanding exports, especially to Asia. \\n\\nHigher consumption of E15 4 ethanol blends has a lower impact on the forecast. Regulatory reform permitting year-round E15 sales introduced in 2019 makes it more attractive for service   \\n\\n> 3The RFS2 runs until 2022; however, because of the policy’s importance to the agriculture sector and ethanol’s octane value, IEA biofuel forecasts assume that the policy remains in place throughout the forecast period.\\n> 4Gasoline blended with 15% fuel ethanol by volume.\\n\\n0\\n\\n500 \\n\\n1 000 \\n\\n1 500 \\n\\n2 000 \\n\\n2 500 \\n\\n3 000 \\n\\n3 500 \\n\\n2019 2025 \\n\\n> kb/d\\n\\nRoW \\n\\nChina \\n\\nIndonesia \\n\\nEurope \\n\\nBrazil \\n\\nUnited \\n\\nStates 0\\n\\n50 \\n\\n100 \\n\\n150 \\n\\n200 \\n\\n250 \\n\\n300 \\n\\nEthanol Biodiesel HVO    \\n\\n> kb/d Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |71\\n> IEA.

However, only around 1% of them offer E15 nationally, and expanding supplies to the approximately 20 states where the blend is not currently available will take considerable time. \\n\\nUS biodiesel and HVO production in 2019 matched 2018’s record output of 120 kb/d. Demand is underpinned by the RFS2 and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). Domestic output was also supported by anti-dumping duties on biodiesel imports from Indonesia and Argentina that rendered them uneconomic. \\n\\nOutput is expected to increase strongly to 220 kb/d by 2025. Significant investment in HVO capacity is evident with a number of large scale projects anticipated to come online over the forecast period. Given stagnant diesel demand, production growth is driven by policies. These include demand driven by RFS2, a tightening of the transport fuel carbon intensity requirements of California’s LCFS and the re-introduction of the USD 1/gallon blenders’ tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel until 2022. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nAsian countries provide half of biofuel production growth, led by China, India and Indonesia. \\n\\nEthanol output in Brazil increased significantly in 2019. Record production of 620 kb/d represented 13% y-o-y growth, on top of the strong increase in output observed in 2018. This was achieved by mills maximising ethanol production at the expense of sugar due to low international sugar prices. In the centre-south region, which accounts for most production, a record 65% of recoverable sugars were dedicated to ethanol production during the 2018/19 harvest. This share has been maintained in 2019/20 to date. Robust hydrous ethanol demand was also a factor as a result of its price competitiveness at the pump versus gasoline, supported by lower levels of federal taxation on ethanol. \\n\\nEthanol production is anticipated to increase to around 670 kb/d by 2025. Growth is driven by the improved economics of biofuel production under the Renovabio scheme, introduced in 2020. RenovaBio introduces emissions reduction targets for fuel distributors which can be met via obtaining traded emissions reductions certificates awarded to biofuel producers.         \\n\\n> 0\\n> 20\\n> 40\\n> 60\\n> 80\\n> 100\\n> 120\\n> 140\\n> 160\\n> United States Brazil China India Indonesia\\n> Kb/d\\n> Ethanol Biodiesel and HVO Oil Market Report 2020 Supply\\n> PAGE |72\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nRenovaBio is expected to provide a supportive framework for further ethanol production capacity investment. This is anticipated from the expansion of existing sugar mills, idle mills coming back into use and greenfield investments. Ethanol production from corn feedstock is currently relatively small compared to that derived from sugar cane, but is expected to grow over the forecast period with a number of plants in development and ample domestic corn supply. \\n\\nBrazil produced a record 100 kb/d of biodiesel in 2019 – a 10% y-o-y increase – with soybean oil as the main feedstock. A good soybean harvest, combined with stronger demand resulting from the blending mandate increase to 11% during the year, spurred greater production. \\n\\nOutput growth of over 20% is forecast to 2025, with production scaling up to over 120 kb/d and consequently reducing biodiesel plant overcapacity. The primary impetus for higher output is a staged mandate increase to 15% by 2023. The next incremental increase to 12% is due in March 2020. Each step will be dependent on positive results from automotive industry testing the effects of using higher blend levels. RenovaBio may stimulate more biodiesel production from lower carbon waste oil and animal fat feedstocks, which currently account for less than a fifth of output. \\n\\nTable 2.5 Annual production in selected biofuel markets (kb/d) \\n\\nCountry/region  Fuel  2019 output \\n\\n2025 output  Forecast overview \\n\\nOECD Europe  Ethanol  85  91 \\n\\nContracting gasoline demand; stronger policy support post-2020 not anticipated; EU anti-dumping duties on US ethanol repealed; growing E10 demand in France. \\n\\nChina  Ethanol  69  161 \\n\\n12% gasoline demand growth; expanding consumption from 11 to 15 provinces; new facilities are under construction; nationwide E10 programme suspended. \\n\\nIndia  Ethanol  36  73 \\n\\n12% gasoline demand growth; record consumption in 2019, long-term 20% blending target for 2030; government loans to expand production capacity. \\n\\nOECD Europe  Biodiesel / HVO  287  285 \\n\\n6% diesel demand contraction; stronger EU policy support post-2020 not anticipated; HVO project development; ARG and IDN anti-dumping duties removed. \\n\\nIndonesia  Biodiesel  136  170 \\n\\nMove to B30 mandate in 2020, new plants coming online and underutilised capacity ramping up; lower share of output exported; trade barriers in key export markets. \\n\\nMalaysia  Biodiesel  27  40 \\n\\nTransition from B7 to B10 mandate in 2019, then B20 during forecast; 16% increase in diesel demand; plant overcapacity; uncertainty over future EU exports. \\n\\n> Note: ARG = Argentina; IDN = Indonesia.\\n\\n## HVO production surges \\n\\nHVO production is set to double from around 110 kb/d in 2019 to 220 kb/d by 2025, as policy frameworks in Europe and the United States spur higher demand. In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive for 2021-30 will stimulate waste- and residue-based HVO consumption as fuels produced from used cooking oil and animal fat feedstocks are permitted to make up 3.4% 5 of the     \\n\\n> 5The 3.4% is the share taking account of provisions within the directive that allow countries to double-count the energy content of biofuels made from UCO and animal fats towards the transport renewable energy target.

All rights reserved.\\n\\n14% of renewable energy in transport targeted for 2030, equivalent to approximately 95 kb/d of HVO. In the United States, the RFS2 and California’s LCFS are driving HVO deployment: it accounted for 5% of fuels used in compliance with the RFS2 in 2018 and 20% under the LCFS. \\n\\nThe fact that HVO is less constrained by blend limits than biodiesel, offering higher flexibility for blenders, is another factor behind growing demand. HVO is technically a “drop-in” fuel, and can be used unblended in some diesel engines and without modifications to fuelling infrastructure. The value of co-products from HVO production is also a driver of production growth. Renewable propane, naphtha, chemicals and aviation biofuels are part of an HVO plant’s product slate. \\n\\nThese factors have spurred a raft of new announcements, with several projects in an advanced stage of development. Overall this would equate to around USD 10 billion of investment in new capacity if fully delivered. However, the forecast anticipates that around 60% of these projects will be realised. Most are new refineries in Europe and the United States. The capacity of fossil fuel refineries converted to HVO production also increases because investment costs are lower and project delivery is quicker than for new-build plants. Most new plants intend to use waste and residue feedstocks for production, so mobilising supply of these feedstocks is crucial to deliver the forecast. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

Refining and Trade \\n\\n# Highlights \\n\\n• The impact of energy transitions is increasingly evident in the pattern of refined product demand growth. Transport fuels, which account for the bulk of refinery earnings, see a sharply lower pace of growth over the forecast period. Light products demand increases the most, and this is overall balanced by growth in the lighter categories of oil supply. \\n\\n• Refiners, nevertheless, continue ramping up capacity, adding another 6.2 mb/d over the next five years. This is higher than the increase in demand for refined products, estimated at 4.4 mb/d. More than 70% of capacity additions are in countries that are already net exporters of refined products. \\n\\n• With increased competition and the push for decarbonisation, the refining industry must adapt its strategies. One option is petrochemical integration. However, the scope is limited, given the expected supplies from NGL-based projects. Integrating biofuel production through co-processing of renewable diesel or the conversion into bio-refineries is becoming popular. In the meantime, refiners also have to consider near-term challenges and opportunities such as production of fuels compliant with the new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules. \\n\\n• The United States (US) becomes a net seaborne crude oil exporter and the Gulf Coast expands its role as the second largest crude export hub outside the Middle East. In the second half of the forecast period, the call on Middle East exports increases with the flat-lining of US production growth. The reliance of Asia on net oil imports from other regions reaches 81 % of demand. \\n\\n• Europe and all the regions of the southern hemisphere remain reliant on product imports from the United States, the Russian Federation (hereafter “Russia”), the Middle East and the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”). The United States overtakes Russia as the top product exporter and China surpasses India in product exports, becoming the largest supplier in Asia. \\n\\n# Global overview \\n\\nThe global refining sector experienced a rare phenomenon in 2019. For the first time in recent decades, refining throughput declined year-on-year even as oil demand continued to increase and capacity additions were at a near-record level. This was partly explained by higher maintenance and more frequent unplanned outages. Even so, refining margins dipped below 2018 levels despite lower average crude oil prices. In the United States, refiners scaled back their processing from the historical high rate of 2018 to the levels seen in 2017, when throughput was affected by hurricane Harvey. This was the most symptomatic example, but it is interesting to note the particularly wide base of declines. In 2019, the number of countries where activity fell Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade \\n\\nPAGE | 76 \\n\\n> IEA.

The fact that weaker refining activity did not support margins indicates destocking after overproduction in 2017-18, when an increase in refinery runs exceeded the growth in refined products demand. \\n\\nIEA 2020.

Global oil demand is forecast to increase by 5.7 mb/d to 2025, which is 2.3 mb/d lower than in the previous six-year period. Consequently, the pace of growth for refinery-supplied products also slows, from almost 4.8 mb/d in the previous six years to 4.4 mb/d over the forecast period, even as the gap between the headline \\n\\n020 40 60 80 100 120 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 $/b \\n\\nBrent Dated \\n\\nNorth Sea Dated \\n\\n0246810 12 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019  \\n\\n> North West Europe Cracking US Gulf Coast Coking\\n> Singapore Cracking\\n\\nMain Regional Margins \\n\\n0246810 2001-07 2007-13 2013-19 2019-25 mb/d \\n\\nTotal demand Refined product demand \\n\\n0246810 2001-07 2007-13 2013-19 2019-25 \\n\\nAdditions Closures Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade \\n\\nPAGE | 77 \\n\\n> IEA.

Oil demand growth was also significantly lower during 2008-13 (when the financial crisis was followed by a period of higher oil prices), compared to the 2001-07 period. The refining industry is used to operating in a cyclical environment, not only due to exogenously driven changes in oil demand, but also due to variations in refining capacity additions. The more pertinent question for refiners, and indeed, oil producers, is whether the expected slowdown in demand growth in the next five years is cyclical or genuinely structural. The oil demand trajectory of the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) from the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2019, the scenario most consistent with sustainable energy development path, implies oil demand peaking before 2025 and a subsequent average annual decline of 2 mb/d. In this scenario, oil use declines in all sectors, except petrochemicals.     \\n\\n> 17.5\\n> 75.7 Additives Biofuels CTL/GTL Crude Gasoline 25.9 Diesel 28.6 Kerosene 7.9 Fuel oil 6.6 Other products 10.9 Naphtha 7.2 LPG 9.4 Ethane 3.4 NGLs Fractionation\\n> 0.4\\n> 1.9\\n> 0.2\\n> 0.1\\n> 6.2\\n> 1.6\\n> 6.3\\n> 3.4\\n> 27.6\\n> 7.9\\n> 6.6\\n> 9.9\\n> 5.6\\n> 3.1\\n> Refining Condensate Direct crude burn 1.1 Processing gains\\n> 2.3\\n> 0.1\\n> 0.8\\n> 23.5 Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |78\\n> IEA.

Taking non-oil elements out of total oil demand, petrochemical feedstock use grows slightly more than transport sector demand by 2025. \\n\\n## Refining capacity developments \\n\\nFollowing near record expansions of 2 mb/d in 2019, the growth in refinery capacity slows through 2025. A number of projects were cancelled or postponed and few projects are expected to start up in 2025. Even so, 6.2 mb/d of net additions of crude distillation units (CDU) and condensate splitters are expected, 1.6 mb/d more than required to meet incremental demand for refined products. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nIn general, new capacity additions are skewed towards countries and regions that are already net exporters of refined products. Some, such as the Middle East and the United States, are also major crude oil exporters (net and gross, respectively), while India and China are the top two net crude oil importers worldwide. \\n\\nChina continues to lead, building another 1.8 mb/d of capacity, mostly from large petrochemically-integrated projects. But the Middle East is not far behind, with just under 1.7 mb/d of net additions. Africa’s 0.8 mb/d additions include the 650 kb/d Lekki plant in Nigeria, and smaller facilities in Algeria and Egypt. We have a conservative view on the timing of the 1.2 mb/d Indian joint venture refinery involving Saudi Aramco and ADNOC and think it will be launched well beyond 2025. In the meantime, several smaller projects provide an incremental 0.6 mb/d of capacity in India. Another 0.6 mb/d comes from North America, including Pemex’s greenfield Dos Bocas refinery in Mexico and ExxonMobil’s expansion project at its Beaumont, Texas, plant. \\n\\nLast year we talked about a paradigm change in refining investments as the relative abundance of light sweet crude requires simpler rather than more complex refining capacity. Upgrading capacity additions, combining units at new sites and additions at existing sites total 3.6 mb/d. While we do not have information on secondary units for some projects, notably, the Dos Bocas refinery, it is still possible to say that the ratio of upgrading capacity to CDU additions has been    \\n\\n> 9.1 6.0 6.2 2.0 1.4 0.3 0.2\\n> mb/d\\n\\nOil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade \\n\\nPAGE | 79 \\n\\n> IEA.

In 2019, some upgrading projects were cancelled; most notably the 60 kb/d coker project at Marathon’s Garyville, Louisiana refinery, where narrowing heavy/light differentials were cited as the main reason. Several Russian refiners, particularly those owned by Rosneft, indefinitely postponed coker, hydrocracker and fluid catalytic cracker additions representing a combined capacity of 250 kb/d. \\n\\nIEA 2020. All rights reserved. \\n\\nNote: Bubble size indicates net capacity change from 2019 to 2025 \\n\\nAt the same time, desulphurisation capacity additions remain relatively robust, at 4.3 mb/d, with the Middle East accounting for almost half of the total, and achieving more than 100% coverage of forecast crude distillation additions. This matches well with their refining requirements as local crude grades have some of the heaviest sulphur content. \\n\\nIEA 2020.

In the next six years refinery gasoline demand growth shrinks to just 35 kb/d on average, a far cry from 365 kb/d seen in the previous six years. Demand for refinery-supplied middle distillates (diesel and kerosene) slows from an average 430 kb/d in 2013-19 to 290 kb/d in 2019-25. These premium transport fuels that support refinery margins are most susceptible to replacement by alternative fuels and technologies such as electric vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles and LNG-fuelled trucks (see Demand ). Also, biofuels and derivatives from coal-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids plants continue taking market share from refiners. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nGasoline demand growth falls to almost nothing, when biofuels and other non oil components are netted out. \\n\\nDemand for heavier fuels, on the other hand, is expected to decline more moderately than in the past. High sulphur fuel oil is replaced by a new type of bunker fuel that will largely defy the traditional logic of fuel categorisation – occupying a space that overlaps heavy residues and lighter components from atmospheric distillation or upgrader flows (see VLSFO blending ).Light ends, such as LPG and ethane continue to lead oil demand growth, albeit somewhat more slowly. \\n\\nTable 3.2 Matching supply with demand \\n\\nDemand categories  Corresponding category in Supply \\n\\nLight ends (LPG and ethane)  NGL \\n\\nLight distillates (naphtha and gasoline)  Light tight oil and condensates \\n\\nMiddle and heavy distillates (kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, direct use of crude oil) \\n\\nOther crudes \\n\\nDevelopments in recent years showed that concerns about a mismatch between the quality of the US shale liquids output (NGLs and light tight oil [LTO]) and the demand barrel were misplaced. In the 2013-19 period, the growth in light ends demand was matched by strong growth in NGL supply. The 5.8 mb/d increase in LTO/condensate supply coincided with a 2.9 mb/d        \\n\\n> -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 mb/d\\n> Ethane LPG Naphta Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel oil Direct crude use\\n> 2013-19\\n> -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\\n> 2019-25\\n\\nOil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade \\n\\nPAGE | 81 \\n\\n> IEA.

All rights reserved. \\n\\nNevertheless, light distillate markets reached saturation in 2018-19 as LTO output shot up. Meanwhile, naphtha demand growth came to an abrupt halt and gasoline demand growth slowed sharply. The average annual gasoline crack fell below USD 10/bbl and has not recovered since. Average naphtha cracks fell from a USD 2/bbl discount to crude in 2017 to almost USD 10/bbl discount in 2019. \\n\\nIEA 2020. All rights reserved. \\n\\nA sharp slowdown of naphtha and gasoline demand in 2018 affected gasoline and naphtha cracks. \\n\\nIt is also interesting to note that the growth in middle distillates demand in 2013-19 was partly offset by declines in fuel oil demand and direct crude burn (see Figure 3.8 ), turning the middle/heavy product group into the least performing among the three. This incentivised refiners                     \\n\\n> - 1 01234562013-19 2019-25 mb/d\\n> NGL LTO and condensate Other crude\\n> Supply Change Supply Change\\n> - 1 01234562013-19 2019-25\\n> Light ends Light distillates Mid/heavy distillaltes\\n> Demand Change\\n> -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> Product Demand and LTO Supply, y-o-y\\n> Naphtha Gasoline (net of non-oil components) LTO/Condensate\\n> - 15 - 10 - 5 0510 15 20 2013 2015 2017 2019 $/b\\n> Cracks Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |82\\n> IEA.

A lower production growth rate for NGLs is a consequence of deteriorating wellhead economics as natural gas oversupply pressures prices. This may give refiners an opportunity to increase output to meet light product demand, even as NGLs supplied from fractionation units have already overtaken refinery output \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: fractionation shows volumes of ethane and LPG from NGL plants, refinery production includes LPG and naphtha.\\n\\n## Petrochemicals – a silver bullet? \\n\\nWhile the increased “call” on refinery-supplied LPG and naphtha is good news for refiners, these products are typically priced at a discount to crude oil. From a practical point of view, these are refinery by-products derived from producing premium transport fuels such as diesel, kerosene and gasoline. On the other hand, petrochemical margins usually exceed margins from transport fuels, where taxes tend to take up a large proportion of the retail price. Petrochemical base products – olefins and aromatics, are higher value goods and are not taxed in the same way as fuels. \\n\\nPetrochemical integration has become very popular with refiners, in part due to the significant operational synergies (energy and by-product flows) and in part due to expectations of an imminent peak in oil use in the transport sector as the energy transition progresses. Refiners are looking to offset potential loss in earnings from declining sales of transport fuels. \\n\\nThe benefits of the operational integration include shared infrastructure and overheads and the utilisation of by-product hydrogen from steam crackers or dehydrogenation units. Hydrogen is a key input in the hydrotreatment of products to meet increasingly stringent quality specifications. By using by-product hydrogen, in lieu of volumes generated through on-purpose steam methane reforming, refineries reduce CO2 emissions and also total energy costs.                  \\n\\n> 0246810 12\\n> 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\\n> mb/d\\n> Refinery Fractionation Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |83\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nWill refiners’ efforts to capture a share of this market eventually result in refining overcapacity spilling over into the petrochemical sector? The growth rate for petrochemicals demand remains robust and is well-correlated with economic activity (see Demand ) but NGL supply growth has provided an alternative pathway to refinery-integrated naphtha or LPG cracking. Historically, ethane crackers were not able to compete fully with naphtha crackers due to skewed yields – 80% ethylene and only 2-3% of another valuable petrochemical base product, propylene - compared to propylene yields of about 15% from naphtha crackers. Increased LPG supplies from US shale production enabled the commercialisation of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, an on-purpose propylene productio method.  \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Note: IEA calculations based on S&P Global Platts.\\n\\nThe share of integrated naphtha crackers is stable thanks to Asia, but PDH is increasing the most. \\n\\nThe parallel, but not necessarily coordinated, deployment of ethane crackers and PDH units that we forecast based on available data on projects presents a serious alternative to naphtha-based petrochemical production without compromising the yield slate. Indeed, while ethane crackers and PDH units combined account for just above 40% of petrochemical capacity today, their share of the capacity additions is close to 60%. The share of refinery-integrated naphtha crackers remains flat over the next six years, largely thanks to new integrated complexes in China, India and the Middle East, but this does not automatically imply that there is scope for refiners elsewhere to massively invest into petrochemical capacity. Globally, gasoline and naphtha account for 25% and 7% of oil-based liquids demand (excluding biofuels, CTL/GTL and additives), respectively. Petrochemical feedstock demand, however, is 12% of total oil demand, increasing to 14% in 2025 in our forecast. The scope for a shift from gasoline production to naphtha-based petrochemicals is thus limited. \\n\\nKorea provides a well-known case of a high level of petrochemical integration. A strong strategic focus resulted in the country accounting for almost one fifth of global naphtha demand in 2019. The share of naphtha in Korean oil demand is 46%, requiring substantial imports of naphtha products on top of local refinery output. In the Netherlands too, the share of naphtha demand is higher than that of gasoline and similar to the share of diesel in domestic consumption, albeit post-refinery gate blending into the gasoline pool is also a reason. Increasing naphtha’s share in       \\n\\n> 32% 27% 34% 7%\\n> Integrated / Naphtha Non integrated / Naphtha Non integrated other (LPG, Ethane) PDH\\n> Installed capacity in 2019\\n> 32% 11% 40% 17%\\n> Additions 2019-25 Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |84\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nglobal oil demand to the same level as in the Netherlands (19%) would imply global petrochemical capacity doubling from 2019 levels. There is no plausible scenario of plastics demand doubling by 2025. \\n\\nOn the other hand, there are no clear first-movers advantages in the globally-connected and margin-oriented refining and petrochemical businesses, which deal in bulk commodities. The incumbents are as much at risk from overcapacity as the newcomers. China’s build-up of capacity is primarily aimed at reducing import dependence on key petrochemical base products. This might have consequences for utilisation rates of petrochemical facilities elsewhere. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\n## HVO – responding to decarbonisation challenges \\n\\nAnother pathway for refineries to adjust to the decarbonising world is to lower the carbon intensity of their products by integrating biofuels in their operations. The two most commonly used biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel. Ethanol and oxygenates are blended into fuel used in gasoline engines. Biodiesel is FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) blended with diesel and is largely suitable for all of its premium uses, be it in road transport or heating and industrial sectors. \\n\\nEthanol and biodiesel blending into transport fuel, generally mandated, provides mostly logistical and blending synergies in fuel wholesale and distribution. In contrast, production of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which is also referred to as renewable diesel, is a more natural extension of refining activities, with the emphasis being on the processing of renewable feedstock into diesel and other products (LPG, naphtha and aviation biofuel). \\n\\nDepending on technology and type of feedstock, biofuels can be classified as “conventional” e.g. based on crop feedstocks, and “advanced” where waste and residue feedstocks are used. Most advanced biofuel production currently comes from biodiesel and HVO produced from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fats, while technologies to utilise agricultural and forestry residues and municipal solid waste are not widely commercialised. \\n\\nRefiners are increasingly considering HVO projects to respond to renewables fuel mandates and carbon intensity policies such as California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Currently, HVO output is estimated at 110 kb/d and is expected to double to 220 kb/d by 2025 (see Supply ), with most          \\n\\n> 12% 46% 7% 8% 18% 6% 3%\\n> Korea\\n> LPG Naphtha Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Fuel oil Other Products\\n> 10% 5% 27% 9% 31% 7% 11%\\n> Rest of the World\\n> 8% 19% 11% 10% 18% 19% 15%\\n> Netherlands Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |85\\n> IEA.

Thus, refiners have several options: investing in new renewable diesel units (RDU), transforming an existing hydrotreater, or co-processing with petroleum feedstock. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n\\nCo-processing is becoming increasingly popular. \\n\\nNew units have the advantage of being specifically designed for this type of challenging feedstock, but the last two options require lower capital investment, benefitting from synergies with the existing refining processes. Several new RDU projects are currently being developed by oil refiners not only for complying with future mandates, but also to gain experience in this developing industry. Neste is a case on point in the transformation from traditional refining to a portfolio more focused on sustainability via biofuels. Waste and residue raw materials represent about 80% of their feedstock for a total of 60 kb/d HVO production. \\n\\nSeveral refineries have completely shut down their petroleum feedstock processing operations and been converted to biofuel refineries. Examples include Total’s La Mede site in southern France which was previously a 160 kb/d refinery; and Eni’s 80 kb/d Venice and 100 kb/d Gela plants in Italy. The combined HVO output of these three plants is 35 kb/d. Marathon recently announced plans to convert its 19 kb/d Dickinson, North Dakota, plant to a biofuel site, while MOL is considering this option for its 44 kb/d Sisak refinery in Croatia. Co-processing of vegetable oils, usually in small proportions, is already a common practice in some European refineries. \\n\\nHydrotreatment is an essential part of refinery processing and plays a key role in conditioning fuels for end-use sectors. It involves several reactions, in the presence of hydrogen, for not only deshulpurisation, but also denitrification (removal of nitrogen compounds), deoxygenation, demetallation and aromatics and olefins saturation. Roughly a third of hydrogen consumption in refineries is met by naphtha reforming by-product, but the rest is mostly from on-purpose steam methane reforming, which is a source of CO2 emissions. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electrolysis using low carbon electricity are options to decarbonise hydrogen production. Several refineries in the United States, Canada and Europe have launched or are building CCS or electrolysis projects, but it is likely to take time before we see a more widespread use of green hydrogen in refining.            \\n\\n> 050 100 150 200 250 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 kb/d\\n> Dedicated plant Refinery conversion Co-processing Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |86\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nA dedicated hydrotreating unit inside a refinery has pros and cons vs co-processing. In both cases, special considerations are required when feeding fatty acids from different raw materials, unlike petroleum distillates. Presence of a wide range of contaminants demands an adequate pre-treatment of the feedstock. Some are easily removed through filtration and other non-expensive processes, but heavy metals, phosphorus and sodium compounds can reduce catalyst life. In addition, phosphorus contributes to rubber formation, increasing the differential pressure and limiting the feedstock flow rate. Also, high total acid number (TAN) levels cause steel corrosion. These problems are more easily managed in newly designed plants, rather than in converted units or during co-processing. \\n\\nHydrogen consumption is another key consideration for further development of HVO. For petroleum diesel fractions, the main objective of hydrotreatment is desulphurisation. The purpose of hydrotreatment of renewable feedstock is very different, however, as it contains only traces of sulphur. The target reaction is hydrogenation of fatty acids, so hydrogen is consumed as feedstock, rather than as a reagent. As such, hydrogen consumption of renewable feedstock hydrotreatment can be around 5-7 times higher compared to petroleum feedstock. For refinery-integrated projects, this requires expansion of existing hydrogen production capacity to avoid bottlenecks in the operations. \\n\\nTable 3.3 Properties of biodiesel compared to European specification diesel                      \\n\\n> EN590 diesel* FAME HVO\\n> Cetane number 51 50 -65 80 -100\\n> Oxygen (%) 011 0\\n> Density (15°C) (g/ml) Max 0.845 0.88 0.77 -0.78\\n> Distillation range (°C) 250 -360 350 -370 200 -320\\n> Sulphur (ppm) Max 10 00\\n> Storage (stability) Good Challenging Good\\n> *EN 590 is European specification diesel.\\n\\nApart from meeting mandatory biofuel standards, HVO output can help optimise diesel blending. Much like ethanol’s oxygen content boosting gasoline’s octane number and allowing blending of low-octane low-value components, HVO diesel allows to optimise on such important parameters as cetane number and stability especially compared to FAME fuels. Also, its low aromatic content means it emits lower levels of air pollutants than petroleum diesel when used in vehicles with older, less sophisticated engines and exhaust after treatment. \\n\\n## VLSFO blending \\n\\nWhile petrochemical expansion and renewable diesel production are aimed at coping with the impact of decarbonising transport sector, refiners also have to consider challenges and opportunities arising from near-term market developments. The introduction of new sulphur emission standards for bunker fuels by the IMO is the most relevant example. The new rules that limit sulphur emissions to 0.5% from 3.5% came into effect in January 2020. Very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) is one of the options for complying with the new regulations. Fuel oil traditionally refers to residues from atmospheric distillation or secondary processing units. As already highlighted above, VLSFO defies formal categorisation and may refer to different types of fuels: \\n\\n Atmospheric residue (straight-run fuel oil), 0.5% sulphur. About 2-3 mb/d is produced globally from very low sulphur crude oils (e.g. US shale, Algeria, Nigeria, Brazil, the Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade   \\n\\n> PAGE |87\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nNorth Sea, Australia, etc). However, most of this is locked in refinery processes to produce diesel, gasoline, etc. \\n\\n Desulphurised atmospheric residue. An estimated 3.5 mb/d is used as feedstock by upgrading units to produce premium transport fuels. The desulphurisation process may lower the aromatics content, which affects the fuel’s compatibility. \\n\\n Blended from various refinery streams, including the above. On-purpose blending by the refiner optimising various streams: vacuum gas oil (VGO), light cycle oil (LCO), upgrader “bottoms”, etc. The refiner is responsible for the quality and consistency. \\n\\n Blended after the refinery gate from various middle distillates and residue feedstocks. In a simplistic case, a mix of 80% gasoil and 20% fuel oil is required. In reality, it involves more diverse blendstocks. \\n\\n Blended on the basis of heavy sweet crude oil. \\n\\nOnly the first two options for VLSFO can be unequivocally categorised as fuel oil, while the rest are overlaps of various intermediate feedstocks that previously would end up either in the middle distillates or in the fuel oil pool. There have been several instances of heavy sweet crudes used as blendstock to improve viscosity and density properties. Several refiners produce VLSFO by desulphurising residual fuels. Blending, however, seems to account for the largest share of new VLSFO supply. In oil trading, gasoline blending used to be the most complex activity. Now, VLSFO blending is emerging as a complex blending business too. \\n\\nIn the past, viscosity and density were the main targets for bunker fuel blending, which aimed to also minimise the giveaway in cutter stock. Giveaway refers to situations when the overall quality of the blended fuel is higher than required by the specifications without commanding a price premium. Sulphur or viscosity giveaways are two common examples. Currently, with the 0.5% sulphur cap, other parameters are becoming increasingly relevant. The use of low value streams like slurry, petrochemical waste products, etc., while ensuring higher margins, carries the risk of undesirable behaviour of the final product. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved.\\n> Notes: CCAI is Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index; RVP is Reid Vapour Pressure, MON/RON is motor and research octane numbers.\\n\\nIn earlier forecasts it was largely expected that middle distillates would be the preferred cutters to control the sulphur content of the fuel. But the market has turned to other non-traditional blendstocks that comply with the fuel specifications at a lower price. Using low-sulphur VGO     \\n\\n> Density\\n> Viscosity\\n> VLSFO blending Gasoline blending Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |88\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nhelps formulate VLSFO with good properties, thanks to the higher aromatic nature of this stream. Indeed, VLSFO blending has supported VGO prices despite weak gasoline cracks. \\n\\nThere are typically several cutters involved in an optimised VLSFO blending. The goal is to comply with specifications at the lowest possible price, and this requires different shares of each available cutter stock. Stability and compatibility of IMO-compliant fuels was the main concern of ship operators: at the time of writing it seems to have subsided somewhat. Problematic situations are likely to arise due to the relative lack of experience of the industry in the new bunker fuel formulation. On the other hand, ensuring a reliable bunker fuel supply offers competitive advantages to the suppliers. For refineries, this is an opportunity to add blending margins to their earnings, especially with growing competition from new capacity additions and lower demand growth for premium transport fuels demand. This is why VLSFO is likely to continue as the main compliance option and further solidify its market share over the forecast period. \\n\\nEarly assessments of the impact of the new IMO’s regulations made long before their implementation often emphasised the role of diesel as a bridge fuel to fill the gap in the marine bunker market as HSFO demand collapsed. This would allow refiners time to develop a low-sulphur fuel tailored for bunker use. Over the last three years several unexpected developments in the oil market contributed to a smoother start of the regulations. US oil production, including LTO, will be higher than initially forecast in 2016, and rising exports have provided support for less complex refineries in Europe and Asia. While these grades have lower middle distillate yields than achieved by the complex processing of heavy crude oils, they contribute to IMO-compliant fuel supply by freeing up VGO previously used in gasoline production, to be directed to the VLSFO blending pool. \\n\\nTable 3.4 Pros and cons of various blendstocks         \\n\\n> Cutter stock Pros Cons\\n> Diesel Very low sulphur, with low viscosity and density\\n> Combined with other lower quality streams, may reduce giveaways\\n> High price\\n> Often paraffinic origin Compatibility risks\\n> Marine gasoil Commonly, 0.1% sulphur.

Early experience in 2020 has been relatively quiet, but we cannot be sure that this will be maintained. Diesel demand in the first quarter typically declines seasonally by 700 kb/d on average. The 2019-20 heating season in the northern hemisphere has seen higher than average temperatures against a backdrop of lower economic activity, combined with the added uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.

Given that this region also accounts for more than half of new capacity being built, utilisation rates increase only marginally, from 81.1% to 81.8%, led by China and the Middle East. In the Atlantic Basin, runs increase by only 0.7 mb/d, but there are vast differences between different regions. European throughput is set to fall by 0.7 mb/d, with utilisation rates falling to 80.5 %, while runs in North America and Africa will ramp up by 0.8 mb/d each one of them. The Former Soviet Union (FSU) is the only other region with a negative change over the outlook period. Latin America registers small growth. Refining activity in the Atlantic basin is unlikely to recover to its historical peak of 45 mb/d set in 2015, but East of Suez throughput will continue growing unabated barring peak oil demand. \\n\\nTable 3.6 Regional developments in refining capacity and throughput \\n\\n2019  2025  Change  2019  2025  2019-25  2019  2025 \\n\\nTotal capacity (mb/d)  Refinery throughput (mb/d)  Utilisation rates \\n\\nNorth America  22.7  23.4  0.7  18.9  19. 7 0.8  83.5%  84 .4%\\n\\nEurope  15.3  15.3  0.0  13.0  12. 3 -0. 7 85. 1% 80.5 %\\n\\nFSU  9.0  9.1  0.1  6.8  6.5  -0.4  76.4 % 71.4% \\n\\nChina  16.9  18.7  1.8  13.0  15.2  2.2  76.6%  81.3% \\n\\nIndia  5.2  5.8  0.6  5.1  5.5  0.4  98.0%  94.9% \\n\\nOther Asia  14.9  15.5  0.6  11.9  12.1  0.2  80.1 % 78.4% \\n\\nMiddle East  9.4  11.1  1.6  7. 7 9.0  1.3  81 .7% 81.6% \\n\\nLatin America  5.9  5.9  0.0  3.4  3.6  0.2  57.9 % 60.8% \\n\\nAfrica  3.5  4.3  0.8  2.0  2.8  0.8  56.6%  64.0% \\n\\nWorld  102.8  109.0  6.2  81.9  86.7  4.8  79.7%  79.6% \\n\\nAtlantic Basin  55.6  57.3  1.7  43.7  44.4  0.7  78.5%  77.5% \\n\\nEast of Suez  47.1  51.7  4.6  38.2  42.3  4.1  81.1%  81.8% Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade   \\n\\n> PAGE |90\\n> IEA.

Throughput is set to increase by only 0.7 mb/d in our forecast period compared to 1.2 mb/d seen last year. This follows a downward demand revision of 1 mb/d, of which about 0.8 mb/d is for refined products, in particular, gasoline and diesel. Demand for oil products, excluding biofuels, is now set to increase by 0.8 mb/d, but this is a net result of ethane and LPG demand growth (0.9 mb/d) offsetting a small decline in refined products. North America and Europe, the largest demand regions by far, are mature markets for oil-based fuels. Demand growth slows in the FSU and West Africa, but North Africa and Latin America partly rebound from the demand declines seen in the last six-year period. \\n\\nAmericas \\n\\nStagnant demand is the main reason behind the downward revision our US throughput forecast, which is now expected to increase by only 0.2 mb/d vs 2019, and stay below 2018’s historical high. With narrowing light-heavy crude differentials, US refiners are increasingly running imported secondary feedstocks through their upgrading units in search of better margins. This has a negative impact on crude distillation utilisation rates. In addition, the closure of the 330 kb/d Philadelphia refinery in 2019 after a fire is likely to be permanent. However, the top spot of the US refining in the global throughput ranking remains uncontested. The United States continues as the second largest refined product exporter, but overtakes Russia to become the top total oil products exporter, with large flows of LPG and ethane.                     \\n\\n> 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> Atlantic Basin East of Suez\\n> Refinery throughput\\n> 0246810 12 14 16 18 2004 2007 2010 2013 2016 2019 2022 2025 mb/d\\n> China US Europe India Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |91\\n> IEA.

Mexico is a home to 30% of US Gulf Coast refiners’ exports and is thus a significant outlet for them. With Mexico’s average refinery utilisation rate having dropped as low as 36% in 2019, imports from the United States cover 80% of gasoline and 65% of domestic diesel demand, respectively. The government is aiming to cut this dependence. However, this requires large and costly repairs and upgrades to ramp up to normal utilisation rates. Given the financial burden, it is unlikely that both the new project and the repairs will be completed within our forecast period. We expect some improvement in the operating rates of existing refineries. Combined with the commissioning of the new refinery, total throughput could reach 1.1 mb/d by 2025, the same as two decades ago. As domestic demand is slightly declining, overall product imports fall, but Mexico remains a net importer overall. \\n\\nCanada has only a 35 kb/d expansion project for the Come By Chance plant in Newfoundland. The planned second stage of the North West Redwater bitumen refinery has been postponed. The first stage of this refinery started up in 2018 but is yet to start processing bitumen, currently relying on synthetic crudes for feedstock. \\n\\nIn Latin America, the only capacity addition in the forecast period is the 33 kb/d extension at \\n\\nPeru ’s Talara refinery. In Brazil , Petrobras formally scrapped the 165 kb/d second phase of the Comperj refinery. In fact, the first phase is now hanging in the balance as work stopped after reaching 80% completion. Petrobras stated in December 2019 that they are in the process of selling refineries, not building them. The company plans to divest 1.1 mb/d of refining capacity. \\n\\nAt the same time, there has been a flurry of interest in mothballed refineries in and around the Caribbean. Trinidad ’s 160 kb/d site that was shut down in 2018 was sold to a company owned by the workers’ union, but the deal had not been finalised at the time of writing. Klesch Group signed a preliminary deal with the Curaçao government to operate the island’s 335 kb/d refinery. The former operator, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), stopped refining activity on the site in 2018. The 525 kb/d refinery in the US Virgin Islands, previously jointly owned by PDVSA and Hess, is expected to be turned into a 200 kb/d processing complex in a bid to capture bunker fuel margins.                \\n\\n> 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> US\\n> 00.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 11.2 1.4 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 mb/d\\n> MEXICO Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |92\\n> IEA.

We have not included these projects in our forecast. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved\\n> *Peru, Ecuador, Chile. **includes Colombia and Venezuela.\\n\\nThe Caribbean region has turned from a small surplus in 2013 to a net importer of almost 0.9 mb/d, as refining activity has dwindled. But proximity to the US Gulf Coast refining centre is a serious competitive pressure for current or new refineries. The more remote Pacific Coast and Atlantic Coast regions are less import-dependent, but the volumes are large and stable over the forecast period. \\n\\nEurope \\n\\nEuropean refining activity fared much better over the last few years than was generally expected. The region, however, is heavily dependent on external developments. Unexpectedly solid global gasoline demand growth in recent years, combined with a significant slowdown in Mexican and Caribbean activity helped European refiners not only maintain but increase utilisation rates. Our new forecast, however, is again mostly pessimistic: due to near-zero gasoline demand growth, an expected recovery in Mexican activity and the completion of a large new refinery in Nigeria. European runs are expected to fall 0.7 mb/d by 2025. Given declining demand, refined product imports increased by only 50 kb/d, but that is from an already high level of 1.9 mb/d. \\n\\nFormer Soviet Union \\n\\nIn Russia , the massive state-mandated refinery modernisation programme that started almost a decade ago is expected to largely wind down over the forecast period. However, about 250 kb/d worth of upgrade projects were cancelled or put on hold last year. Consequently, fuel oil yields decline less than previously expected. They are now forecast at about 10% in 2025, down from 12.4% in 2019. Throughput declines by 400 kb/d to 5.3 mb/d largely due to lower activity at simple refineries. During the forecast period, India overtakes Russia as the world’s third largest refiner. \\n\\nUzbekistan cancelled the 100 kb/d Jizzakh refinery project, focusing instead on upgrading existing capacity. Belarus is another source of uncertainty in our forecast. The country relied on Russian crude supply for its 560 kb/d refining sector, which was a subject of negotiations at the      \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Pacific Coast* Caribbean** Atlantic Coast mb/d Throughput\\n> 2013 2019 2025\\n> -1.2 -0.9 -0.6 -0.3 0.0 0.3 Pacific Coast* Caribbean** Atlantic Coast mb/d Product balance Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |93\\n> IEA.

For the landlocked country, it would be a challenge to secure alternative sources of supply offering the same profitability. Two thirds of refined product output is exported, however, with local needs at a more modest 150-200 kb/d. \\n\\nAfrica \\n\\nIn 2019, there were both positive and negative developments for the future of African refining. \\n\\nCameroon ’s sole 42 kb/d refinery suffered a major accident and was taken offline. Angola \\n\\ncancelled the 60 kb/d Cabinda project. Uganda ’s 60 kb/d project was officially postponed to a 2024 start-up date, but we assume it may not happen until after 2025. On the other hand, in \\n\\nNigeria , the CDU column of the 650 kb/d single-train Lekki refinery arrived on the ground, after travelling from Sinopec’s facilities in China. The refinery is forecast to be up and running by 2023. We are sceptical about Nigeria’s plans to restore and repair its three other refineries with a total capacity of 450 kb/d. In principle, the West African market, currently 0.9 mb/d net short of refined products, could absorb increased output from all of Nigeria’s refineries, to the detriment of US and European exporters, but the capital investment burden may be prohibitive. \\n\\nOverall, West African regional throughput is expected to increase by 640 kb/d in 2025, but due to demand growth, gasoline and diesel net imports decline by only 200 kb/d to 750 kb/d, with the region remaining an important outlet for refineries elsewhere in the Atlantic Basin. In North Africa, a 100 kb/d refinery in Algeria and a 60 kb/d extension in Egypt are the only two projects over the forecast period. The region’s refined product balances remain unchanged, however. Gasoline and diesel imports are still forecast to cover 45% of demand, and low sulphur fuel oil will be exported to the global bunker fuel blending pool. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved\\n> *Includes gasoline, kerosene and diesel. ** Includes the Republic of South Africa.\\n\\nNew refinery production in West Africa is partly offset by growing demand. The continent’s installed capacity remains heavily concentrated in the north. \\n\\nEast Africa, which includes the Republic of South Africa, should be discussed in the context of the East of Suez as its oil trade is carried out predominantly with countries around the Indian Ocean. The sole project expected to come online in the forecast period is a 25 kb/d mini-refinery in    \\n\\n> 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 2019 imports Output growth Demand growth 2025 imports mb/d  West Africa major products* balance\\n> 33% 16% 51% 2025 Installed capacity by region\\n> West Africa\\n> East Africa**\\n> North Africa Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |94\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nSouth Sudan . The region’s net product import requirements grow to 700 kb/d. Several plans for refineries, from Equatorial Guinea to South Africa, became public last year, but we are waiting for more details before including them in our forecast. \\n\\n# East of Suez \\n\\nEast of Suez, which comprises the Middle East and Asia, accounts for just under 80% of global refined product demand growth, or 3.4 mb/d, and throughput is expected to increase by 4 mb/d to cover incremental consumption. Expected capacity additions to 2025 are 3.3 mb/d, implying a slight improvement in overall utilisation rates from 81.1% to 81.8% in 2025. \\n\\nMiddle East \\n\\nA large-scale refinery construction and modernisation programme is ongoing in the Middle East, though increasingly concentrated in a smaller number of countries. The forecast for gross additions to capacity is essentially unchanged from our last report, at 2.3 mb/d. However, shutdowns are higher at 0.7 mb/d, as they now include an 85 kb/d refinery in the United Arab Emirates (hereafter “UAE”). Saudi Aramco’s 400 kb/d Jazan refinery start-up was pushed back and is now expected in 2020. Kuwait ’s 615 kb/d Al-Zour refinery remains the largest project in the region. Along with the start-up of the clean fuels project tying the Mina Abdulla and Mina al-Ahmadi refineries, it will double the country’s refining capacity. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved\\n\\nCapacity additions continue in a smaller number of countries. \\n\\nIndia \\n\\nAbout 0.6 mb/d of new crude distillation capacity is expected to come online in India, and runs are forecast to increase by 0.4 mb/d, with utilisation rates dropping slightly to 95%. This assumes increased downtime due to refineries moving to production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel for the country’s Bharat VI standards expected to kick off in the fiscal year of 2020. Production of higher quality fuels typically entails higher frequency of stoppages.         \\n\\n> 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 Saudi Arabia Iran Kuwait UAE Qatar Oman mb/d\\n> 2013\\n> 2019\\n> 2025 Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |95\\n> IEA. All rights reserved.\\n\\nIndia remains a net product exporter, but volumes halve during our forecast period. Capacity additions are likely to accelerate in the second half of the 2020s. The most notable project is the 1.2 mb/d Raigad refinery, a joint venture between three Indian state-owned firms, Saudi Aramco and ADNOC. Its prospects have become somewhat uncertain since the capital investment estimate swelled to USD 70 bn and it was dubbed the most expensive oil industry project ever. For Saudi Aramco, its Initial Public Offering in late 2019 means there will be more scrutiny over its participation in large projects. \\n\\nChina \\n\\nAfter a record level of 1.2 mb/d of capacity additions in 2019, the pace slows over the forecast period, with a cumulative 1.8 mb/d of new capacity. Petrochemical-oriented projects, such as Zhejiang Petrochemical’s 400 kb/d second phase and Shenghong’s 320 kb/d refinery, account for 40% of the additions. We have removed from our list independent refinery capacity expansions, totalling 270 kb/d. Sinopec’s Gulei, Zhangzhou project is now going ahead as a petrochemical-only plant, with the CDU unit postponed, which is also the case for the expansion project at the çompany’s Zhenhai site. Driven by petrochemical base product self-sufficiency goals, China’s throughput is forecast to increase by 2.2 mb/d, with average utilisation rates improving from 76.6% to 81.3%. Further improvement could come from consolidation in the small-scale independent refinery sector, especially in Shandong. While still behind the United States in terms of refining throughput, China overtakes India to become the third largest net exporter of refined products after Russia and the United States. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved\\n\\nTransport fuel exports increase while petrochemical feedstock imports continue. \\n\\nOther Asia \\n\\nThe only capacity change expected in OECD Asia over the forecast period is the shutdown of the 115 kb/d Osaka refinery in Japan . Elsewhere, three refinery projects were removed from the forecast period due to cancellation or delay: a 50 kb/d extension at Indonesia ’s Cilacap refinery, a 90 kb/d extension in Malaysia ’s Port Dickson site and a 50 kb/d expansion at the Limay refinery in the Philippines . New projects include small-scale sites in Mongolia and Malaysia and an expansion in Pakistan .     \\n\\n> -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Ethane / LPG Gasoline / Naphta Diesel / Kero mb/d\\n> Net Product Balance\\n> 2019\\n> 2025\\n> 0246810 12 14 16 18 20 2019 2025 mb/d\\n> Capacity Throughput\\n> Refining Oil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade\\n> PAGE |96\\n> IEA.

Refined products imports nevertheless increase as demand grows by 0.9 mb/d. The second phase of Chinese firm Hengyi Petrochemical’s refinery in Brunei is the largest project, adding 280 kb/d, with smaller additions in Indonesia, Viet Nam, Pakistan and Mongolia. In Malaysia , a commodity trader is building a small unit aimed at the marine bunkers market. \\n\\nJapan is still seen as the country most vulnerable to increasing competition in Asia, with refinery throughput expected to fall by 0.5 mb/d to 2025. By 2025 Japanese gasoline and diesel demand will fall behind naphtha, which sees continued solid demand from the petrochemical sector. The latter is the reason for the relative robustness of Korea ’s refining sector, where the activity forecast is more steady. \\n\\n# Crude and products trade \\n\\nTwo major parallel developments are forecast in oil trade: the United States becoming a net oil exporter and Asia driving towards 31 mb/d of net oil imports. For several months at the end of 2019 the United States registered net oil exports. We forecast the United States achieving a positive net oil balance on a sustained basis in 2021, including coverage of the oil consumption of US dependent territories. For US-50, net oil exporter status is reached in 2020. \\n\\nThe consequences of Asian demand growth are most acute in terms of its impact on oil trade logistics and security. Already in 2019 Asia imported 27 mb/d of crude oil and products, more than the OECD’s peak net imports at the start of the millennium. Excluding OECD Asia, where emergency stockholding is generally high, the rest of Asia’s imports will increase from 20 mb/d in 2019 to 24.3 mb/d in 2025. For comparison, the net oil imports of OECD Europe and North America combined were 20.4 mb/d in 2005, their historical peak. At that time, their stockholding was 3.3 bn barrels, representing 160 days of coverage for net imports. In developing Asia, China seems to have progressed most in building inventories: however, the precise level of stocks is not publicly available. Estimates range between 700 mb observed by satellites (only above-ground floating roof facilities) and about 1 bn barrels implied by oil balance calculations.

By 2025, at least a quarter of Asian imports will have to come from the Atlantic Basin: increasing voyage duration and inherently limiting flexibility when dealing with emergencies. \\n\\nIEA 2020. All rights reserved \\n\\n# Crude oil trade developments \\n\\nIncreased crude exports out of the United States dominate global crude trade developments in the first half of the forecast period. In the second half, as non-OPEC production growth flattens, the call on production and exports out of the Middle East increases.

All rights reserved.\\n\\nWith our outlook for US crude production revised slightly upward and the outlook for crude processing revised lower, US export availability is forecast to be higher in this report. The US Gulf Coast has become the second largest oil export hub after the Persian Gulf. In 2019, seaborne exports totalled 2.6 mb/d, overtaking Kuwait and Nigeria. Russia’s 5 mb/d of exports, by contrast, are spread between several outlets. The largest by volume – the Baltic Sea ports, delivered 1.5 mb/d. In 2019 the United States supplied more crude oil to seaborne markets in the Atlantic Basin than Russia. \\n\\nTaking into account landlocked Canadian crude deliveries to US refiners in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast, the export availability of US crude increases, and the United States becomes a net seaborne crude oil exporter in 2023. This means that crude oil exports out of the Gulf Coast more than offset imports into the West Coast and the US North East. These regions do not have easy access to US domestic barrels given the prohibitive shipping costs associated with Jones Act rules and will continue relying on external suppliers. \\n\\n> IEA 2020. All rights reserved\\n> Note: FSU = former Soviet Union.\\n\\nThe emergence of this new trade paradigm is commonly attributed to quality issues. US grades are lighter, while the Gulf Coast refining system has some of the most complex processing capacity in the world. However, increased exports out of the Gulf Coast were not accompanied by increased imports. Since the crude oil export ban was lifted in 2015, total imports have almost halved, and seaborne imports fell by more than half to just 1.2 mb/d. This means that the US refiners absorbed the larger share of the LTO production (currently around 8 mb/d) as only 2-3 mb/d is being regularly exported. Asia has been the largest destination for these exports, but Europe and Latin America are regular takers of US crude, too. In fact, some of the Latin American importers are net crude oil exporters themselves: e.g. Colombia and Brazil, in search of lighter and lower sulphur grades for their refining sector. The UAE also regularly imports light US crude grades for processing in condensate splitters. \\n\\nEven as the pace of growth of US production is slowing, it remains the biggest source of incremental crude supply and exports. US exports increase by another 2 mb/d, followed by Brazil, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Norway. Chinese imports grow by 2.4 mb/d while Southeast Asian nations collectively increase inflows by 1.1 mb/d.         \\n\\n> Angola Algeria Oman Kuwait Nigeria Venezuela UAE Mexico Egypt Saudi Arabia Colombia Canada Guyana Norway Libya Iraq Brazil Norway US Libya -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Africa Middle East Latin America Europe/FSU North America\\n> mb/d\\n\\nOil Market Report 2020 Refining and Trade \\n\\nPAGE | 99 \\n\\n> IEA.

Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and other Asian countries south of the equator have become large net importers, relying on very long-distance supply routes. \\n\\nEthane/LPG \\n\\nIncreased supplies of US NGLs drive incremental ethane and LPG exports towards countries with a growing appetite for light ends, mostly in Asia. The Middle East is another important source of supply growth for light molecules. The two regions together will export 600 kb/d more NGLs, far ahead of any other source.

Increasing refinery throughput would result in higher gasoline production, for which demand growth prospects have vanished. Latin America and Africa also remain large diesel importers. Exports out of the United States and Russia do not fully cover the gap. The need for supplies from Middle Eastern refineries and even Asia remains stable. \\n\\n> IEA 2020.

Russia, the main source of heavy, high sulphur fuel oil, will still export at least 400 kb/d of fuel oil in 2025, but these flows increasingly find outlets in feedstocks markets (such as the US Gulf Coast, and, potentially, Europe and China) rather than bunkers. Stable Asian import volumes come from bunker fuel requirements, and are expected to be filled with blending components for the new VLSFO from Europe, Latin America, North Africa and the United States. \\n\\nIEA 2020.

This year, the report considers topics such as the impact of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on demand; slowing supply growth in the United States and other non-OPEC countries; and the level of spare production capacity in OPEC countries to help meet demand growth. Oil 2020 looks at the interplay between the expanding US influence in global oil supply and the demand from Asia for exports from the Middle East. At the same time, global energy transitions are affecting the oil industry: companies must balance the investments needed to ensure sufficient s upplies a gainst t he n ecessity o f c utting e missions. In a decarbonising world, refiners face a big challenge from weaker transport fuel demand. \\n\\n€80 \\n\\nISBN 978-92- 64-48313-2 \\n\\nISSN 2520 -2707 \\n\\n# 9HSTCQE*eidbdc+\\n\"\n",

Last December at COP28, a deal to “transition away” from fossil fuels was reached by the parties. Among them, breaking away from oil represents a massive effort and probably the most complex challenge to undertake globally. The IPCC has warned: any new oil well pushes the world further from a +1.5°C warming mitigation path. However, **from crude to refined fuels, and in petrochemical industries including packaging and clothes manufacturing, oil is ubiquitous**. Globalisation and transport infrastructures are still deeply oil dependent. Despite some improvements and the emergence of new alternatives, **oil substitution remains puzzling**._\\n\\n_In a world where petroleum fuels 92% of the transport sector, where plastic and fibres derived from oil are everywhere and where we use oil by-products every single day, what is the future of this widely spread commodity in the context of energy transition?_\\n\\n_Through this report, **Enerdata aims to shed light on the latest**_[_**trends in the oil market**_](https://www.enerdata.net/research/forecast-enerfuture.html)_**, and the challenges associated with gradually replacing it as a primary source of energy in many sectors**. Leveraging cross-country data and insights on supply and demand side, this brief provides a snapshot of the current trends, before diving into the transition pathways with a prospective analysis designed from Enerdata-_[_POLES model._](https://www.enerdata.net/solutions/poles-model.html)\\n\\nGLOBAL OIL MARKET\\n-----------------\\n\\n##### **Much more than fuelling cars**\\n\\nOil is known to be widely used in the transport sector. It is one of the most important commodities in the world and a pillar of globalisation having revolutionised travel modes and merchandise transport. Crude oil is refined into various petroleum products for end-use. They are essential in many different sectors and value chains, not only for transportation. Oil is ubiquitous in our daily lives and the goods we consume.\\n\\n**Figure 1:**[**Global petroleum products output – 2023**](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\n[![Image 10: Global petroleum products output ](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/petroleum-products-output.png)](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [Global Energy & CO 2 Data](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\nAmong the oil products, fuels for cars, ships, or aircraft represent more than two-thirds of refinery output. T he other refined products are also crucial. They are notably used for heating and cooking (LPG), petrochemicals and plastics (naphtha), paving and roofing (bitumen), and other manufacturing activities such as textiles. For instance, around two-thirds of clothing is made from synthetic fibres, such as the well-known polyester, which is mostly derived from petroleum. But clothes are just an example among the thousands of goods containing oil derivatives.\\n\\nThe global effort required to wean our economies from oil is massive as it is present under miscellaneous forms and usages for which there are no or few substitutes.\\n\\n##### **Production side**\\n\\nIn 2023, the USA was the largest producer of crude oil and NGL by far, with 7,000 Mbl. The country’s production increased by a staggering 11% year-on-year, exploiting abundant shale oil reserves on top of the conventional ones.\\n\\nBack in the early 2010s, Saudi Arabia and Russia were the largest producers with a production ranging from 3 800 Mbl to 4 300 Mbl per year. However, the USA accelerated the production drastically throughout the years by almost tripling the output from 2010.\\n\\n**Figure 2:**[**Largest crude oil and NGL producers – 2023**](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\n![Image 11: Largest crude oil and NGL producers](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/production-2023.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [Global Energy & CO 2 Data](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\nOil is a crucial resource for Middle Eastern countries which rely heavily on oil rents to sustain economic growth. The region represents 31% of [global oil production](https://yearbook.enerdata.net/crude-oil/world-production-statistics.html) with 5 nations ranking among the ten largest producers. Data from the World Bank (2021)estimated that oil rents account for 43% of the GDP in Iraq, 28% in Kuwait, 24% in Saudi Arabia, 18% in Iran, and 16% in the UAE. It reveals a crucial need for economic diversification in the Middle East to cope with energy transition stakes.\\n\\nAlongside Russia, the USA, and Middle Eastern countries, Canada, China, and Brazil are also massive oil producers. Latin America and Africa are home to large oil fields, but the national productions are not sizeable to those of North America and Middle East.\\n\\nA large share of global oil trade is controlled by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The production of the member states 1 combined represents 60% of the global supply. A large share of this production is exported, unlike the production in China or the USA being mostly consumed domestically. A larger group, the OPEC+, was founded in 2016 to include additional oil-producing countries such as Russia or Mexico.\\n\\nThe organisation has a strong influence in controlling the global oil market, deciding on the number of barrels produced by the members, which directly influences the price.\\n\\n##### **Demand side**\\n\\nApart from the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic, oil demand kept growing every year since 1990. Over the past 30 years, final consumption increased by 57%. The distribution of demand among sectors didn’t significantly evolve, nonetheless.\\n\\n**Figure 3:**[**Global final consumption of oil per sector**](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\n![Image 12: Final consumption of oil per sector](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/consumption-per-sector.png)\\n\\nSource: [Enerdata](http://www.enerdata.net/), [Global Energy & CO 2 Data](https://www.enerdata.net/research/energy-market-data-co2-emissions-database.html)\\n\\nIn 2023, final consumption of oil recovered to its pre-pandemic level after a 9.4% drop recorded in 2020. Overall, the transport sector accounts for 61% of total consumption, of which 47% goes to road transport. Industry represents 7%; residential, tertiary, and agriculture 11%; while non-energy uses account for the remaining 21%.\\n\\nOil represents almost all the energy consumed in the transport sector (92%). There is also a large demand for space heating in buildings and dwellings, and for various industrial processes.\\n\\nThe evolution of global demand for oil will massively depend on the activity and structural changes in the transport sector. An emphasis on the [decarbonisation](https://www.enerdata.net/decarbonisation/) of the sector is presented later in this report.\\n\\nAt the country level, unsurprisingly, the USA and China are the largest oil consumers by far, followed by India, Japan, and Russia. It shows a tight correlation between GDP and oil demand.\\n\\n##### **Inelasticity of demand and price sensitivity**\\n\\nThe demand for oil is quite inelastic to its price, as the historical trends have shown. The effects of price volatility and external shocks on oil consumption were much smaller than for other commodities.\\n\\n**Figure 4: Brent spot price**\\n\\n![Image 13: Brent spot price](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/brent-spot-price.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [EnerMonthly](https://www.enerdata.net/research/monthly-oil-gas-coal-electricity-data.html)\\n\\nBrent (high-quality crude oil)price is a good reference for oil price worldwide. The monthly average data shows the volatility of oil prices over the past 15 years and their sensitivity to external shocks. OPEC strategic decisions, geopolitical tensions, and country policies on reserves exploitation are factors influencing the trading price. Monthly Brent spot price ranged up to more than $120/bl following the 2008 financial crisis and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and down to $23/bl due to an oversupply at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdowns. In the coming years, the spot price for oil is expected to stabilise around $70-75/bl.\\n\\nThe pricing mechanisms will be different, nonetheless. As refined oil products feed 92% of global transports, trade and mobility still cannot occur without oil. Hence, as goods and passengers flow rise, the consumption of oil increases regardless of the price to sustain the extended demand. Historically, the price has been mostly driven by the level of supply. However, we can expect a more demand-driven price in the future as consumption starts to plateau or decrease in the longer term.\\n\\nSince both supply and demand for oil are not very responsive to price changes, fluctuations can have a large impact on end-user’s purchasing power as well as on producing countries’ revenue. Furthermore, changes in oil price often impact the rest of the economy.\\n\\nTRANSITIONING AWAY FROM OIL\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe IPCC has warned that no more additional reserves should be exploited. Any new oil well moves the world further away from a +1.5 °C warming limitation path. Moreover, “limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets.” Experts estimate that about 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. To limit global warming down to 1.5°C, significantly more reserves must remain unburned.\\n\\nFor the first time ever, at COP28 in December 2023, the parties reached on a landmark agreement to move away from all fossil fuels, including oil. Even though this agreement is still far from what is needed to maintain global warming below 2°C, it signals an acceleration of the global effort in transition.\\n\\n_The charts and figures presented in this section are derived from **Enerdata-**_[_**POLES model**_](https://www.enerdata.net/solutions/poles-model.html)_2 based on three scenarios: EnerBase, EnerBlue, EnerGreen. Explanatory documentation on scenarios definition can be found in appendix._\\n\\n##### **Future market: Oversupply and global peak demand by 2030?**\\n\\nOver the medium term, major international agencies and energy market experts anticipate a peak demand for oil between 2028 to 2030. From a global view, the oil demand is expected to plateau before gradually decreasing at the beginning of the 2030s. However, we observe strong regional disparities in forecasted consumption patterns.\\n\\nKey sectors like shipping, aviation, freight, and petrochemicals are lagging in switching to alternative fuels. Hence, large areas of oil demand remain firmly entrenched.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the supply side, it is very likely that the market will be oversupplied. The OPEC+ is sticking to high demand forecasts for the next two years. Upstream oil and gas investments continued to increase in 2023, surpassing $US 500bn. This situation could drag the price down.\\n\\nAdditionally, new well drilling is still expanding especially in the Middle East where the economies massively rely on oil rents.\\n\\n##### **Structural and regional disparities – Economic growth influence on consumption patterns and Asia’s surging demand**\\n\\nDeveloping economies are expected to see a rising demand for a longer period. As depicted in Figure 5, the demand in non-OECD countries is expected to grow at least until 2035 with the current state of policies. While the EnerBase scenario (business as usual)forecasts a continuously growing demand, the EnerBlue scenario (aligned with updated countries NDCs)sets the peak in 2034 for non-OECD countries. However, due to fast economic growth and energy affordability matters, final consumption of oil will remain high in developing economies. Over the longer term, it is expected to remain an important primary source of energy in many countries, even in the EnerGreen scenario (aligned with the Paris Agreement).\\n\\n**Figure 5:**[**Final oil consumption forecasts**](https://www.enerdata.net/research/forecast-enerfuture.html)**- OECD vs non-OECD comparison**\\n\\n![Image 14: Final consumption of oil](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/Final-consumption-oil.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [EnerFuture](https://www.enerdata.net/research/forecast-enerfuture.html)\\n\\nIn OECD countries, final demand will start declining in the three scenarios. In 2023, a slight 1% drop was observed. This was notably due to the current conjuncture with sluggish growth, to efficiency improvements and a slow switch to other fuels such as e-fuels which can be used in various sectors and for which the production is slowly growing with renewables development. In OECD countries, it is very likely that demand already peaked just before the 2008 financial crisis and will now decline gradually. The magnitude of the decline will depend on the policies implemented and the level of investments involved to reduce oil consumption.\\n\\nAsia is by far the region with the fastest growth in oil demand. China, India, and Southeast Asian emerging economies such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, are driving up the demand. The region represents more than 1/3 of global final oil consumption, and this share is expected to climb to one-half in both scenarios displayed in Figure 6. As energy demand is increasing to sustain economic growth in Asia, the transport and industry sectors are absorbing larger volumes of oil. Undoubtedly, the capacity and pace of Asian countries to control and reduce oil demand in the coming two decades will determine the global transition path.\\n\\n**Figure 6: Final oil consumption per region**\\n\\n![Image 15: Final consumption of oil per region](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/Final-consumption-oil-per-region.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [EnerFuture](https://www.enerdata.net/research/forecast-enerfuture.html)\\n\\nDifferent consumption paths are anticipated. Final consumption of oil is expected to grow in Africa to support the rise in population and economic development. Middle East and Latin America are likely to experience a rather steady pattern in oil consumption over the next 25 years, depending on whether stringent policies are implemented or not.\\n\\nNorth America and Europe have historically been by far the largest consumers of oil during the 20 th century and the early 2000s. However, if the stated policies to reduce oil use are thoroughly applied, we can expect a drastic drop in consumption by 2050. Currently, despite efficiency gains and the ongoing electrification of the transport sector, consumption remains high, tending to plateau rather than decrease. The USA remains the largest consumer of oil with a final consumption of 703 Mt in 2023.\\n\\n##### **How to reduce oil consumption and emissions in the transport sector?**\\n\\nThe transport sector is the least diversified in terms of energy end use. 92% of the final consumption is filled by oil products. Oil is a crucial commodity for global trade as it fuels shipping, aviation, and merchandise trucks. Personal cars and motorbikes fleets are also constantly growing to serve population’s travel needs. Globally, the transport sector absorbs roughly 60% of oil consumption. Of this share, 47% is attributable to road transport. Hence, because of this oil dependency, the energy transition of the sector is puzzling, and it remains difficult to abate. However, the sector boasts fast innovation and new technologies readiness is evolving rapidly. As cleaner technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs)are becoming cheaper and more reliable, the demand for oil will tend to decrease in the long run.\\n\\nEnerdata’s Wedges tool assesses the levers for emissions abatement up to 2050. The figure below represents the contribution of various levers to shift from one scenario to another.\\n\\n**Figure 7: Transport sector – Global emission decreasing levers**\\n\\n![Image 16: Transport sector – Global emission decreasing levers](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/transport-sector-global-emission.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, EnerFuture -[Wedges tool](https://www.enerdata.net/research/lever-impact-tool-co2-emissions.html)\\n\\nIn both cases, electrification accounts for about two-thirds of the abatement efforts. A reduction in activity and passenger volume along with efficiency gains will also have a crucial role to play in reducing oil consumption and emissions subsequently. The development of biofuels and e-fuels is not to be neglected either as they are gaining significant market shares.\\n\\n*   **Electrification**\\n\\nAmong the solutions, [electric vehicles (EVs)are at the centre of governments](https://www.enerdata.net/publications/executive-briefing/electric-vehicles-trends.html) and manufacturers interests. EV sales have seen exponential growth from less than 1% market share 10 years ago to 14% of global car sales in 2022. Currently, China holds the largest market for EVs by far, being the number one manufacturer and having the largest fleet on its roads. While the USA and Scandinavian countries were early adopters, [China’s market](https://www.enerdata.net/estore/energy-market/china/) grew exponentially now representing 60% of global EV purchases and 35% of exports. China is also home to 80% of the Li-ion batteries manufactured worldwide which are crucial components of EVs. However, lithium’s scarcity will be a major issue over the medium and long term.\\n\\nManufacturers are also putting growing emphasis on developing electric trucks and buses. A lot of big cities around the world have recently significantly increased their electric public transportation offering.\\n\\n*   **Activity and modal shift**\\n\\nReducing activity and encouraging modal shift are also critical pillars to decarbonise the transport sector. In incentivising modal shifts and behavioural changes, governments have a key role to play. The development of public transportation infrastructures such as railways will play a pivotal role in developing countries, but also in the most advanced economies. In general, urban planning and reducing the average distance to all necessary infrastructures can help cutting the travel times and traffic. Behavioural changes from final consumers should also be encouraged. This could be accelerated by fiscal, and prices incentives on fuels, facilitating access to public transport (subsidies, larger networks)or even developing biking facilities and car sharing where it is feasible for small travel distances.\\n\\n*   **Technology-based solutions with efficiency and clean fuels**\\n\\nShipping and aviation are more challenging to decarbonise, and the improvements will come from technology-based solutions, coupled with slower growth in freight. However, it is very unlikely that we will see a reduction of flight volumes. But innovation in engine types can boost efficiency improvements for aircrafts, ships, and vehicles. To pursue an ambitious transition across sectors, changes in supply chain and logistics are expected. Globally, investments are growing to encourage the development of low-carbon fuels such as biofuels or hydrogen. These solutions boast a large potential but cannot be implemented on a large scale as it stands. Notably, carbon-free hydrogen production remains very limited.\\n\\n##### **CO 2 emissions pathways and environmental impacts**\\n\\nIn 2023, oil combustion was responsible for 31% of global CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion, after that of coal and mineral solids (47%). However, decreasing oil consumption is more challenging since substitutes for coal are more developed and affordable, especially in the power sector. Based on EnerBlue scenario aligned with the current NDC’s, CO 2 emissions from oil combustion will hence decrease at a lower speed. Around 2035, oil emissions could be greater than the ones from coal.\\n\\n**Figure 8: CO 2 emissions from oil combustion**\\n\\n![Image 17: CO2 emissions from oil combustion](https://d1owejb4br3l12.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/inline-images/co2-emissions-from-oil-combustion.png)\\n\\nSource: Enerdata, [EnerFuture](https://www.enerdata.net/research/forecast-enerfuture.html)\\n\\nHypothetically, if all NDC’s and currently stated targets are thoroughly met, CO 2 emissions from oil should be 40% lower by 2050 compared to the 2023 level (45% less than the BAU scenario mark in 2050). In the most ambitious scenario leading to a well below 2°C warming, emissions from oil combustion must be cut by 67% compared to the BAU trajectory.\\n\\nOn top of the global warming effects, oil and other fossil fuels burning is responsible for serious global health issues and environmental disasters. As a whole, fossil fuels are indirectly responsible for millions of deaths per year. WHO estimates that about 7 million deaths per year are attributable to outdoor and household ambient air pollution. Oil and fossil fuels in general are not the only sources of ambient air pollutants, but they contribute massively to the death toll. China and India record more than 60% of these deaths with big urban areas facing extremely high levels of air pollution which is the first cause of premature deaths.\\n\\nExploration and extraction of oil deposits is also harmful to the environment by disrupting the animal habitats and biodiversity. In the worst cases, accidents like oil spills in the sea are devastating with large ecosystems destruction and long-lasting pollution impacts.\\n\\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\\n-------------\\n\\n*   Oil is much more than just a car fuel. It has been the catalyst of globalisation and remains a pillar of trade to this day. In majority of countries, daily life is flooded with unsuspected oil by-products.\\n*   Crude oil exports is the main source of economic growth in the Middle East, where many countries sit on massive reserves and generate wealth and development by exploiting them. Despite the necessity to reduce oil drilling, the USA has recently accelerated their production substantially becoming the first global producer by far.\\n*   The transport sector accounts for 61% of final oil consumption, 47% going to road transports. Oil is also an important source of energy for space heating and miscellaneous industrial processes in some countries. The largest economies absorb a very high share of global consumption.\\n*   The spot price of oil is sensitive to external shocks and geopolitics. Historically, the price of oil has been more supply driven as the demand is quite inelastic due to the lack of substitutes.\\n*   There are strong disparities in consumption patterns between advanced and emerging economies. Asia is the region with fastest growing demand for oil. It is very unlikely to see the demand decreasing in Asia, Middle East and Africa in the near future. In the scenario aligned with NDCs, the consumption in these regions should plateau, while North America and Europe to a lesser extent will have to drastically reduce consumption.\\n*   In the transport sector, several[decarbonisation levers](https://www.enerdata.net/decarbonisation/)to reduce emissions from oil combustion are clearly identified. Widespread electrification of road transport stands as the most impactful, notably with EV market growth. Modal shift and activity slowdown has also an important role to play. Technology-based solutions to foster efficiency and clean fuels can also help bridging the gap.\\n*   All sectors combined; oil combustion represented 31% of CO 2 emissions in 2023 (11GtCO 2). To meet the pledges of the Paris Agreement, CO 2 emissions from oil need to decrease by 60 to 70%. As of now, if NDCs are met, it would lead to a 40% drop, still insufficient to cope with the commitments.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n----------\\n\\n*   IPCC, _AR6 Synthesis Report_, March 2023\\n*   Cherif, Reda, Fuad Hasanov, and Madi Sarsenbayev (2024), “Call of Duty: Industrial Policy for the Post-Oil Era,” IMF Working Paper 24/74\\n*   World Bank indicators\\n*   Karn Vohra, Alina Vodonos, Joel Schwartz, Eloise A.

      "\n",
      "Collect comparative analyses and future scenarios for oil demand across multiple regions—including OECD, non-OECD, Asia, Americas, and Europe—from various authoritative forecasts. Capture expert projections that align both with global climate goals (e.g., IPCC-aligned pathways) and business-as-usual trajectories.

      "# Research Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Comparative Regional Oil Demand Projections and Scenarios\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Global Demand Plateau and Regional Disparities**  \n",
      "  Multiple credible agencies project global oil demand growth slowing substantially through the late 2020s, plateauing near 105–106 mb/d around 2028–2030. However, regional distinctions are notable:  \n",
      "  - **OECD** countries show steady declines or flat demand, led by efficiency gains, electrification, and structural economic trends.  \n",
      "  - **Non-OECD Asia**, particularly India and Southeast Asia, continues as the principal driver of incremental demand through 2030, with China’s demand growth moderating substantially and nearing plateau.  \n",
      "  - **Middle East** and **Africa** see moderate growth, driven by population growth, urbanization, and rising prosperity; yet energy transition policies are impacting demand in some nations (e.g., Saudi Arabia's power sector fuel switching).  \n",
      "  - **Americas** (outside US and Canada) see slight demand growth, but Mexico experiences long-term declines due mainly to underinvestment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scenario Types and Variability**  \n",
      "  - **Reference / Business-As-Usual Cases** show continued demand growth into the mid-century, with OPEC projecting steady increases beyond 115 mb/d by 2045. Some emerging markets' high population and economic growth underpin this scenario.  \n",
      "  - **Evolving Policies / Stated Policy Scenarios** (e.g., IEA STEPS) incorporate announced energy and climate policies, forecast peak demand near 2028–2030 followed by plateaus or moderate declines.  \n",
      "  - **Ambitious Climate / Net Zero Scenarios** aiming to limit warming to 1.5–2°C project large-scale demand reductions, with global oil use falling toward 25–35 mb/d by 2050. These pathways depend heavily on technology adoption, policy implementation, and shifts in energy consumption behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Key Drivers and Sectoral Shifts**  \n",
      "  - **Transport Sector**, consuming ~60% of global oil today, is shifting sharply due to EV adoption; substitution effects cause peak road fuels demand prior to 2030.  \n",
      "  - **Petrochemicals Sector** remains a major growth driver, particularly in Asia, requiring increased naphtha, LPG, and ethane.  \n",
      "  - **Aviation and Shipping** fuels grow modestly but face decarbonization challenges; fuel efficiencies and biofuel deployment moderate growth.  \n",
      "  - **Power Generation** in oil-dependent regions (notably Saudi Arabia, Iraq) is seeing significant fuel switching to natural gas and renewables, cutting oil demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Upstream and Refining Implications**  \n",
      "  - Upstream industry is adapting with increased focus on NGLs and condensates to match petrochemical demand.  \n",
      "  - Refiners face slowing demand growth for transportation fuels and must contend with rising non-refined liquids and biofuels. This spurs shifts in product slates and pressures on refinery utilization, especially in mature OECD markets with declining demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Future Disruptions Affecting Oil Demand\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Geopolitical Risks**  \n",
      "  - Sanctions on major producers (Russia, Iran, Venezuela) have reshaped supply and trade flows, especially affecting crude and product exports to traditional markets.  \n",
      "  - Trade policies, including tariffs and trade uncertainties (e.g., US-China frictions), impact supply chains and demand forecasts.  \n",
      "  - Regional conflicts and political instability continue to pose risks to producing countries and global markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Technological Innovation**  \n",
      "  - Rapid growth in EVs, especially in China and increasingly in OECD countries, is altering demand patterns. The pace of EV adoption, price parity, infrastructure, and policy support are critical factors.  \n",
      "  - Public transit expansions and modal shifts (notably in China’s high-speed rail growth) reduce demand for oil-based transport fuels.  \n",
      "  - Efficiency improvements across vehicle fleets, aviation, and maritime vessels lower oil intensity, influencing overall consumption.  \n",
      "  - Emerging technologies (like AI-associated increased electricity demand) may indirectly increase energy demand but could influence fuel consumption shifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Policy Shifts**  \n",
      "  - Global and regional climate policies targeting emissions reductions and energy transitions shape oil demand trajectories and industry investment strategies.  \n",
      "  - Mandates for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels add complexity and substitution into conventional oil demand.  \n",
      "  - National strategies for energy security and diversified energy portfolios affect both production and consumption outlooks, possibly slowing or hastening peak demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Stakeholder Perspectives\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Governments**  \n",
      "  - Developed nations promote aggressive decarbonization policies, vehicle electrification targets, biofuel mandates, and energy efficiency standards.  \n",
      "  - Emerging economies balance growth ambitions with gradual energy transitions, often relying on continued oil consumption for industrialization and mobility growth.  \n",
      "  - Oil-producing countries emphasize supply security, investment in upstream and petrochemicals, and economic diversification due to fossil fuel revenue dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Industry**    \n",
      "  - Oil majors demonstrate cautious optimism with balanced strategies to sustain supply while expanding low-carbon investments; some scale back crude capacity expansions, focusing on NGLs and gas.  \n",
      "  - National oil companies in Middle East and other regions continue ambitious supply capacity expansions aligned with market opportunities and transition challenges.  \n",
      "  - Refiners explore integration with petrochemicals and renewable fuels to adapt to shifting demand and regulatory environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Environmental Groups**  \n",
      "  - Advocate for accelerated transitions away from oil aligned with IPCC pathways, emphasizing potential stranded assets and the necessity to limit additional fossil fuel infrastructure.  \n",
      "  - Warn that continued investments in upstream and refining capacity may conflict with global warming mitigation goals if demand does not decline swiftly.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Global oil demand is projected by authoritative agencies to approach a plateau near 105–106 million barrels per day by the late 2020s, with regional divergences marked by declines in advanced economies and growth in emerging markets, especially Asia. Multiple scenarios span from slow growth and plateauing under current policies to sharp declines consistent with ambitious climate targets. Critical factors shaping future demand include rapid EV adoption, technological efficiency gains, structural economic changes, petrochemicals growth, and energy transitions in power generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future disruptions from geopolitical tensions, evolving trade policies, technological advances, and government strategies will significantly affect these trajectories. Stakeholder perspectives reveal a complex and often contradictory landscape balancing energy needs, climate goals, and economic interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "For policymakers and businesses, preparing for a broad range of futures comprising both sustained demand growth in developing regions alongside structural declines in developed markets is essential. Transition strategies, energy diversification, and investment realignment must consider these multi-layered risks and opportunities to navigate the evolving global oil landscape effectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "- Global oil demand is projected to plateau near 105–106 million barrels per day (mb/d) by the late 2020s, followed by moderate growth or plateauing depending on scenario assumptions.  \n",
      "- Demand growth is concentrated primarily in emerging economies, especially India and parts of Asia and Africa, while OECD countries exhibit flat or declining consumption due to efficiency gains and electrification.  \n",
      "- Key demand growth sectors include petrochemicals, aviation, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), which help offset declines in road transport fuels driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption.  \n",
      "- Divergent scenarios range from continued demand growth exceeding 115 mb/d by 2045 (OPEC’s outlook) to sharp declines consistent with ambitious climate goals projecting demand falling below 30 mb/d by 2050.  \n",
      "- Technological innovations, policy frameworks, geopolitical risks, and evolving stakeholder strategies create significant uncertainties and alternative pathways in oil demand evolution.  \n",
      "- The upstream sector is adapting to shifting market conditions with increased focus on NGLs and petrochemical feedstocks, while refiners face challenges adjusting to changing fuel demand patterns and regulations.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The future trajectory of global oil consumption is a critical concern for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and environmental advocates due to its profound implications for energy security, economic development, and climate change mitigation. Despite extensive diversification of energy sources, oil continues to dominate the global energy matrix, particularly in transport and petrochemical sectors. The forthcoming two decades encapsulate a transitional period characterized by competing influences: growing demand from expanding economies on one hand, and accelerated energy transition efforts on the other. This report synthesizes authoritative projections, country-level dynamics, sectoral drivers, and emerging disruptions shaping the outlook for global oil demand through 2045.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the interplay of these complex factors is essential for adequately preparing supply chains, investing strategically in upstream and refining capacities, and formulating coherent policy frameworks that reconcile developmental aspirations with climate commitments.\n",

      "### 4. Technological and Policy Influences\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption**: The dominant influence reducing demand for road transport fuels, particularly effective in OECD markets. Slower adoption in developing countries constrains near-term demand shifts.  \n",
      "- **Fuel Efficiency Improvements**: Continued incremental reductions in oil intensity per kilometer traveled in ICE vehicles globally.  \n",
      "- **Public Transport & Modal Shifts**: Infrastructure expansion, notably China’s high-speed rail network, reduces demand for petroleum-based transport fuels.  \n",
      "- **Climate Policies and Regulations**: Fuel economy standards, biofuel blending mandates, carbon pricing, and EV incentives are accelerating transitions in advanced economies. However, policy ambition and enforcement vary widely globally.  \n",
      "- **Upstream Production and Refining Adaptations**: Emphasis is shifting towards natural gas liquids and petrochemical feedstocks, with refiners facing challenges managing declining gasoline/diesel volumes and growing biofuel blending requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Geopolitical and Market Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sanctions and Trade Disruptions**: Constraints on Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan crude supplies reshape global trade patterns and add supply-side uncertainty.  \n",
      "- **Political Instability**: Conflicts in key producing regions risk supply disruptions and price volatility.  \n",
      "- **Technological Breakthroughs or Barriers**: Advances in battery technology or hydrogen fuel could accelerate demand reduction, while infrastructure bottlenecks or affordability issues in emerging markets may delay transitions.  \n",
      "- **Macroeconomic Volatility**: Global recessions, inflation, or rapid growth spur shifts in oil demand trajectories.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "Authoritative projections from IEA, OPEC, ExxonMobil, McKinsey, and national agencies form the principal corpus of quantitative forecasts, supplemented by academic analyses on energy transitions, technological innovation diffusion, and policy impact evaluations. The theoretical underpinning is grounded in energy economics models balancing supply-demand, technology substitution, and policy-induced behavioral change.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology & Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Data synthesis occurs across historical consumption records, futures market analysis, scenario modeling (integrated assessment models, system dynamics), and sectoral projections. Quantitative data is harmonized using consistent units (mb/d) and timelines extending to mid-century.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario divergence primarily originates from assumptions regarding EV adoption rates, emerging market growth, and policy implementation efficacy. Limitations include uncertainty around geopolitical developments and disruptive technological innovations. The heterogeneity in regional development paths necessitates a nuanced, multi-scenario approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Research Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "Continued monitoring of EV market penetration, biofuel technological advances, and sector-specific decarbonization (e.g., aviation, shipping) is recommended. More granular country-level analyses incorporating socioeconomic variables and behavioral economics would refine demand estimations. The evolving role of hydrogen and synthetic fuels merits further investigation.\n",

Prentiss, PhD ; Sarah A. Sydlowski, AuD, PhD, MBA; Camille C. Dunn, PhD, CCC-A The indications for cochlear implantation have expanded over time due to evidence demonstrating identiﬁcation and implanta-tion of appropriate cochlear implant (CI) candidates lead to signiﬁcant improvements in speech recognition and quality of life (QoL). However, clinical practice is variable, with some providers using outdated criteria and others exceeding current labeled indications. As a results, only a fraction of those persons who could beneﬁt from CI technology receive it. This document sum-marizes the current evidence for determining appropriate referrals for adults with bilateral hearing loss into CI centers for for-mal evaluation by stressing the importance of treating each ear individually and a “revised 60/60 rule”. By mirroring contemporary clinical practice and available evidence, these recommendations will also provide a standardized testing protocol for CI candidates using a team-based approach that prioritizes individualized patient care. This manuscript was developed by the Adult Cochlear Implantation Candidacy Task Force of the American Cochlear Implant Alliance using review of the existing literature and clinical consensus.\\nKey Words: adult, candidacy, cochlear implant, evidence, protocol, recommendation.\\nLevel of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 00:1–14, 2023 BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, improvements in cochlear implant (CI) technology, increased awareness of the technology, and changes in candidacy criteria have led to a rapid growth of evidence in the literature regard-ing the beneﬁt of CI in adults. As such, recommendations for CI candidacy and referral continue to evolve. For instance, unlike historical CI recipients with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), CI candi-dates may now have an audiogram that mirrors or over-laps that seen in a hearing aid (HA) candidate and may have hearing in the contralateral ear up to and including normal hearing. Yet, the low utilization of CIs suggests hearing health care providers unfamiliar with current candidacy criteria may be relying on older, stricter criteria for referring potential CI candidates.\\nTo assist in the standardization of practice, CI man-ufacturers have relied upon device labeling from national healthcare governing bodies (i.e., Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). However, labeling has not kept pace with clinical practice. Many commercial payers use FDA labeling to inform their coverage policies, while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a coverage determination policy that dictates payment for CI services. As a result, some patients who may beneﬁt from CI technology yet fall outside of FDA labeling and/or CMS candidacy criteria are prevented from pursuing the technology. The inconsistency among clinical best prac-tice, labeling, and coverage determination policies can create wide variability in practice methods and may lead to the inconsistent provision of CI services on a national, regional, and even a local level. Using established evi-dence, the recommendations summarized in this manu-script will serve to standardize the approach and testing protocol for determining adult candidacy for a CI and highlight the importance of a multi-disciplinary team-based approach for individualized patient care.\\nUNDERUTILIZATION OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION An estimated 466 million persons worldwide live with disabling hearing loss (>6.1% of the world’s popula-tion).\\nOver 40 million people in the United States (US) alone suffer from disabling hearing loss (4.6%).1,2 In persons 12-years-and-older, the prevalence of bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss is estimated to be approx-imately two million1 making hearing loss the third most prevalent chronic health condition in the US.1–3 With the advent of the ﬁrst multi-channel CI system in 1985, guidelines requiring bilateral severe-to-profound SNHL to qualify for CI became the standard of care.

However, as of 2015, 170,252 US adults have been implanted out of an estimated 1,337,144 traditional audiometric CI candidates for a utilization rate of 12.7%.4 Moreover, fewer than 1 million devices have been implanted worldwide.5 The under-penetration of CIs among adult candi-dates is multifactorial and may in part be explained by poor awareness among clinicians and consumers alike.\\nUnfamiliarity with current candidacy criteria, lack of awareness of referral processes and clear referral path-ways to a CI center, and ﬁnancial incentives to sell hear-ing instruments may all contribute.6,7 In addition, hearing healthcare providers currently performing adult CI evaluations demonstrate considerable variability in their testing methodologies and in the deﬁnition of a “good candidate”, leading to inconsistent referrals.8 Last, patients unaware of CI technology, or those unfamiliar with candidacy criteria, may lack the impetus to discuss their options for hearing rehabilitation with their pri-mary care physician, and vice versa. Collectively, these factors likely result in missed opportunities for persons with hearing impairment to be considered for CI.9 As technology has improved and outcomes data have been analyzed, candidacy has gradually expanded to include patients with increasing amounts of residual acoustic hearing and higher aided speech recognition scores (Table I). Evidence now demonstrates FDA device labeling is not always consistent with current clinical practice. An increasing number of patients with hearing loss who fall outside of labeling guidelines are receiving CIs10 and often demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt.11 For example, increasing numbers of patients with asymmetric SNHL (ASNHL) are undergoing CI in their poorer hear-ing ear and demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt in both the implanted ear only condition and when using the CI and the contralateral HA together (bimodal, binaural condition).11–14 In addition, adults with unilateral severe-to-profound SNHL (USNHL) in the poorer ear and thresholds better than or equal to 20 dB HL in the unaf-fected ear (single-sided deafness; SSD) are now undergo-ing CI, and the results have been positive.15–18 Recipients demonstrate improved speech understanding in noise, improved sound source localization, reduction in tinnitus, improved QoL, and increased quality of hearing compared with other available technologies for SSD such as bone conduction implants and contralateral routing of signal HAs.19–24 Furthermore, using a CI in one ear does not alter or decrease performance on the contralateral side, even in cases of normal acoustic hearing.25,26 There have been two versions of a recommended Minimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB)27 and a third is currently in development. Although both versions recom-mend inclusion of a variety of test conditions (ear-speciﬁc and bilaterally aided; sentences in quiet and both ﬁxed and pseudo-adaptive noise, and monosyllabic words), the suggested materials have evolved over time. Speciﬁcally, HINT sentences were replaced by AzBio Sentences28 which were shown to be more ecologically valid.29 How-ever, the MSTB never speciﬁcally suggested how to use the recommended materials to determine CI candidacy.\\nAs the criteria for CI continue to broaden, the materials and methods used to test potential CI candidates remain highly variable and open to interpretation, even for tradi-tional, bilaterally deafened candidates.8 This variability has led to inconsistencies between testing centers making comparison of objective outcomes between patients more difﬁcult and may impair the successful prognostication of postoperative outcomes.30 In addition to objective measures, such as speech recognition scores and severity of hearing loss, determin-ing whether a patient is a CI candidate relies on a cen-ter’s familiarity with outcomes, expanding criteria, and comfort recommending implantation for those outside of FDA indications. Although a few authors have published evidence-based criteria for recommending a CI,31 there is limited guidance regarding how other factors such as cog-nitive ability, willingness to participate in an aural reha-bilitation program, duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation use among others should be used in the can-didacy process.\\nBy developing and implementing standardized rec-ommendations for assessing and conﬁrming CI candidacy, uniformity in testing protocols will be improved, the num-ber of potential CI recipients referred for testing will be increased, and consistency between those considered CI candidates amongst centers will be enhanced. Ultimately this standardization will lead to increased penetration of CI technology to those who could most beneﬁt.\\nMETHODS The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based rec-ommendations for CI candidacy identiﬁcation and referrals based on a comprehensive review of the literature. The recom-mendations encompassed in this article were developed following a predetermined methodological approach which included: (1) determining the need for a set of formal recommendations regarding adult cochlear implant candidacy and navigation of the CI referral pathway by the American Cochlear Implant Alli-ance (ACI Alliance) Board of Directors (BOD); (2) the formation of a team of subject matter experts in the ﬁeld to serve as co-authors and the designation of a lead author; (3) numerous teleconferences to establish the rationale and methodology for development of the recommendations; (4) performing a compre-hensive literature review assisted by medical librarians identify-ing the most up-to-date and state-of-the-art manuscripts on the topics of CI candidacy and referral guidelines; (5) the formation of the recommendations and the creation of an evidence-based pathway as guided by assimilation of the data based on the liter-ature review; (6) a period of review and public comment by the ACI Alliance BOD followed by a unanimous vote of endorsement.\\nThe comprehensive literature review was conducted with the help of medical librarians using a combination of keywords related to cochlear implants from multiple databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Dyna Med, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The articles were reviewed by the authors based on relevance and strength of evidence. The relevant articles were grouped into subtopics (i.e., aided speech recognition testing, can-didacy referral recommendations), and the recommendations were formulated based upon discussion, analysis, and data syn-thesis by all authors.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 3 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Several authors have published parameters to help determine the appropriateness of an adult CI referral and predict the likelihood the candidate will qualify. Gubbels et al. used audiometric ﬁndings to identify patients who are likely to meet CI candidacy fol-lowing formal testing.32 Speciﬁcally, patients with low frequency (250, 500, 1000 Hz) thresholds greater than 75 dB HL and/or a monosyllabic word recognition test score of <40% have a greater than 80% probability of meeting CMS criteria at the time of publication (i.e., <40% sentence recognition score bilaterally in the best-aided condition). When using only a monosyllabic word score <32%, 86% of the patients met CMS criteria.\\nIn patients with private insurance, the accuracy of the model remained strong (>80%) if the monosyllabic word recognition test score was <45%.\\nZwolan et al. performed a similar analysis in which audiometric data were used to predict patients who would qualify for CI under the same CMS criteria.33 When only those patients who met traditional CI indications (i.e., consistent with Medicare coverage guidelines of <40% bilateral sentence recognition score at the time of study publication) were considered, 95% had a preopera-tive pure-tone-average (PTA) in their better hearing ear of 60 dB HL or greater and 92% had an unaided monosyl-labic word score of 60% or lower. When applied retrospec-tively to a large sample of adult CI candidates, this “60/60 guideline” yielded a 96% sensitivity rate (i.e., candidates met both criteria) and a 65% speciﬁcity rate (i.e., non-candidates did not meet the 60/60 criteria).\\nAlthough the Zwolan paper uses a 60/60 guideline in the better hearing ear as a guideline for referral, due to FDA approval for cochlear implantation in cases of asym-metrical hearing loss and single-sided deafness, a “revised 60/60 guideline” is recommended where post-lingually deafened adults are referred for CI evaluations when one or both ears demonstrate a monosyllabic word score that is less than or equal to 60% correct and the unaided PTA (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) is greater than or equal to 60 dB HL. It is important clinicians recognize use of this guideline will only capture the most clear-cut CI candidates and may overlook candidates who still meet FDA criteria with steeply sloping hearing loss.\\nUsing objective audiological data will help hearing health professionals make high-yield and appropriate CI evaluation referrals. However, it is important to recognize that other studies demonstrate a poor correlation between unaided speech recognition scores and eventual CI candidacy.34 Therefore, if a patient demonstrates lim-ited beneﬁt from appropriately ﬁt hearing aids, it is important to consider referral for a formal CI evaluation regardless of the performance on any single test or group of testing measures.\\nIn summary, hearing health professionals should use the revised 60/60 guideline and refer any patient with an unaided PTA of 60 dB HL or greater and an unaided word score of 60% or less in one or both ears for formal CI evaluation. Importantly, those patients falling outside of the revised 60/60 guideline or those falling outside of tra-ditional CI labeling who do not receive adequate beneﬁt from their current technology (i.e., unilateral SNHL, asymmetric SNHL, low frequency thresholds in the nor-mal to mild range) should also be referred for a formal CI evaluation. Although other information will be reviewed by the CI team prior to candidacy determination, using audiometric parameters such as these ensures a greater number of potential CI candidates will undergo consider-ation. If the patient is deemed a non-candidate following formal CI candidacy evaluation, the referring hearing health professional should monitor the patient’s perfor-mance and re-refer with worsening performance or ongo-ing hearing difﬁculties.\\nCOCHLEAR IMPLANT CANDIDACY CONSIDERATIONS The adult CI candidacy evaluation should involve a multi-disciplinary team with experience treating CI patients. Typically, a CI team includes a CI surgeon(s) and audiologist(s) specializing in CI. Based on the com-plexity of the candidate’s case, the pre-, peri-, and/or post-operative needs of the candidate, and/or the customs of a particular CI center, additional team members may include a rehabilitation specialist (auditory-based thera-pist), a neuro-radiologist, psychologists/neuropsycholo-gists, social worker(s), previously implanted peers, and family members/caregivers.\\nIn addition to audiometric thresholds and aided sen-tence recognition in quiet,8,34 other information must be obtained during the hearing health history including ear-speciﬁc aided speech recognition using monosyllabic words and sentences in noise, etiology and duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation, patient’s occupation and/or social hearing needs, demographics (i.e., social support, age, hearing needs such as occupation), decre-ment in hearing speciﬁc and/or overall quality of life (QoL), motivation, and underlying medical factors.\\nAlthough speciﬁc recommendations based on these vari-ables may differ between individual clinics, this holistic approach towards the CI candidate has been shown to be beneﬁcial as part of healthy aging in CI recipi-ents35 (Fig. 1).\\nMultiple hearing health variables have been shown to correlate with CI outcomes including duration of deafness,36–41 HA usage,42 age at implantation,43 and eti-ology of hearing loss.36,39,42 There is evidence that addi-tional demographic variables may also be determinants of Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 4 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License future performance following CI. Tang and colleagues44 showed factors including cohabitation with a spouse or family member(s), familiarity with technology, emotional intelligence, and adherence to postoperative aural reha-bilitation programs can inﬂuence speech outcomes follow-ing CI. Therefore, during the CI evaluation process it is critical to discuss factors such as resources available to the CI candidate and family, a family’s willingness to pro-vide a strong support system, a commitment to post-implantation (re)habilitation, the proximity of the patient to the CI audiologist and/or qualiﬁed (re)habilitation pro-vider, and the willingness and ability of the patient to wear the device.\\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND HEARING NEEDS Although a diagnostic audiogram provides objective information, it does not accurately represent the patient’s functional status as a result of their hearing loss. Speciﬁ-cally, it does not reﬂect the impact the hearing loss has on the patient in their everyday life (i.e., auditory fatigue, cognitive load, etc.) resulting from routine communication disabilities. It is well known that severe-to-profound hearing loss can have signiﬁcant consequences on one’s mental health, social inclusivity, and overall QoL.45 Research demonstrates the advantages CIs have over HAs on the recipient’s QoL in multiple domains including psychosocial health, functional health, and social inclu-sion.46,47 Despite the superiority of CI over HAs in these domains and others, CI penetration in the US has remained stagnant.9 Some evidence even suggests that the duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss prior to CI surgery is increasing, further exacerbating the delete-rious effects on the patient’s QoL.48 Although a CI may not be the optimal approach for every patient who qualiﬁes audiometrically, understanding each person’s hearing needs, communication goals, and QoL detriment are essential in providing additional insight for counsel-ing on realistic expectations. Furthermore, each candi-date must demonstrate a motivation for and commitment to the entire CI process.\\nAUDIOLOGIC EVALUATION Hearing History Obtaining an accurate and comprehensive hearing health history is critical to identifying appropriate CI candidates and understanding factors that may inﬂuence outcomes post-operatively. Information regarding the eti-ology of hearing loss (if known), rate of hearing loss pro-gression (supplemented by prior audiometric testing where available), history of ampliﬁcation, otologic history (i.e., prior operations and/or pathology), and post-implant expectations must be obtained during the clinic evalua-tion. In addition, age at onset of hearing loss and its rela-tionship to language acquisition must be queried as these factors may help predict postoperative outcomes and/or device use compliance.49,50 Speciﬁcally, adult candidates with pre-lingual onset of deafness demonstrate large inter-individual performance variability and levels of sat-isfaction and may be at increased risk for device non-use.51,52 Careful attention to duration of deafness is essential when discussing realistic expectations with the candidate.\\nDuration of deafness can be difﬁcult to accurately assess in some patients. An understanding of the estimated amount of time that the inner ear and auditory cortex has been without meaningful stimulation is critical as it is an important predictor of post-operative objective suc-cess.\\nLack of stimulation may be due to severe-to-profound hearing loss, lack of adequate ampliﬁcation, and/or failure to engage in auditory-rich environments.\\nAs discussed above, longer durations of post-lingual deaf-ness are associated with poorer outcomes after CI.36–41 However, successful outcomes following CI in cases of prolonged durations of deafness (>30 years) have been reported.53 Therefore, duration of deafness in bilaterally deafened adults with a post-lingual onset should not be an absolute contraindication for CI, but rather an impor-tant consideration in setting appropriate post-implantation expectations.\\nIn addition to age of onset and duration of deafness, the duration and consistency of ampliﬁcation use in impaired ears must be determined. Even with consistent ampliﬁcation, long-term severe-to-profound hearing loss can lead to auditory deprivation and may impact out-comes following CI.40,41,54 Critically, the ﬁt and settings of current ampliﬁcation must be veriﬁed by the CI audiol-ogist as many potential CI candidates arrive with inap-propriately ﬁt HAs at the time of the evaluation.8 The etiology of the candidate’s hearing loss should be obtained and documented. CI outcomes can vary widely among recipients based on the etiology of hearing loss and must be reviewed with the patient.55–59 Fig. 1.

It is important to understand how the hearing loss impairs or affects the candidate’s ability to work, communicate with friends and family, or interact socially. It is helpful to ask patient-speciﬁc, closed-ended questions that clarify the impact of their hearing loss (i.e., “Can you use a telephone with one or both ears?”, “Can you watch television without subtitles?”, “Can you go out to dinner with friends and keep up with the con-versation?”, “Do you feel your HAs provide sufﬁcient ben-eﬁt?”).\\nMany clinics are using validated screening questionnaires such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Test (HHIE-S)60 to better understand the impact of the candidate’s hearing loss.\\nThis should be repeated post-operatively and shared with the patient by discussing areas of beneﬁt and areas that the patient could beneﬁt from additional rehabilitation.\\nDiagnostic Unaided Audiologic Evaluation A diagnostic audiogram is required as part of CI can-didacy assessment. Objective assessment of the ear under consideration for CI as well as the contralateral ear is important for managing post-operative expecta-tions for residual hearing,61 determining electrode array selection,62–64 determining the optimal surgical approach,65 consideration for the use of intraoperative tools such as electrocochleography (ECochG),66 and future ampliﬁcation of the implanted or non-implanted ear. Results of the diagnostic audiogram must be used together with the other components of the CI evalua-tion discussed below as part of a holistic candidacy approach (see above) (Fig. 1).\\nConsistent with the Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation, a standard set of mea-sures must be performed and documented for each patient.67 Pre-operative air conduction (AC) pure tone thresholds including 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz are performed via insert earphones for each ear. Bone conduction (BC) pure tone thresholds including 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz are performed for each ear. High frequency AC thresholds (2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) are often in the severe-to-profound range and may not be measurable using standard audiometry.\\nThese are assigned the value of 120 dB for documentation purposes.\\nSigniﬁcant residual low-frequency hearing in either ear (but especially in the ear-to-be-implanted) should not serve as an exclusion for CI candidacy. When low fre-quency thresholds (125, 250, and 500 Hz) are in the normal-to-moderately-severe range, hearing preservation is possible following CI. Electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) using an acoustic component with a CI ear-level sound processor should be considered and discussed if functional hearing preservation is achieved. Functional hearing is deﬁned as hearing in the low frequency thresholds that can be adequately ampliﬁed (i.e., meeting targets on real-ear measurements). Patients using acous-tic plus electric hearing demonstrate improved speech perception outcomes,68 speech understanding in noise,69–72 binaural cues such as summation and squelch,73 sound source localization,70,74 melody recogni-tion and music appreciation,69,75,76 and perceived quality of speech.77 Other objective measures such as tympanometry and acoustic reﬂex thresholds are performed when clinically indicated to screen for the presence of middle ear dysfunc-tion (i.e., middle ear atelectasis, chronic serous otitis, acute otitis media, etc.).78 Although not a contraindica-tion to CI surgery, middle ear dysfunction may delay the implantation process and/or affect the decision regarding which ear to implant.\\nUnaided Speech Recognition Testing As previously discussed, unaided speech recognition testing has historically served as a guide for CI referral.\\nSigniﬁcant variability exists in the testing methodologies (i.e., presentation level, recorded vs. monitored live voice, number of stimuli). Without standardization, the reliabil-ity of using unaided testing to identify CI candidates is diminished and the ability to compare results between practices is mitigated. The recommendation for best prac-tice is to use recorded speech measures. When a patient is non-English-speaking, recommendation for CI evalua-tion may be made based on pure tone audiometry and reported ampliﬁcation beneﬁt.\\nHearing Aid Fitting and Evaluation CI candidacy evaluations must be performed using appropriately ﬁtted and veriﬁed HAs. The term ‘appro-priately ﬁtted and veriﬁed’ refers to the use of real-ear or simulated real-ear measures conducted in a test box or on-ear to conﬁrm the devices meet prescriptive targets for sufﬁcient audibility (i.e., DSL adult, NAL-NL1).79,80 Veriﬁcation can be performed on the patient’s personal hearing instruments or clinic-owned instruments programmed to the patient’s most recent hearing test.81 For CI candidates with underﬁt or poorly ﬁt HAs (e.g., +/\\u0001 >5 dB from the prescriptive targets), the audiol-ogist will make recommendations regarding appropriate adjustments. Functional aided thresholds to determine audibility with the HA(s) can be included but are not essential and should not be the only veriﬁcation method used.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Historically, sentence recognition testing has been the standard for aided speech measures in CI candidacy testing (Table I). However, Sladen and colleagues82 sug-gest sentence recognition scores less reﬂect how well a person can detect and process spectral and temporal com-ponents of speech, and more about how well one can use “top-down processing” to “ﬁll in missing pieces”. Top-down processing can also be altered by cognitive Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 6 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Furthermore, Sladen et al.82 showed a trend for improved performance on CNC word testing when less restrictive criteria (<40% CNC) are used for candidacy qualiﬁcation rather than more restric-tive criteria (<30% CNC).87 Data from Dunn et al.88 dem-onstrate in patients with bilateral deafness who undergo implantation in their worse ear, using a CNC score of ≤50% in the ear to be implanted had a 99.7% sensitivity for identifying candidates who ultimately qualiﬁed based on previous CMS criteria (≤40% sentence recognition testing). Pre to Postoperative CNC word score compari-sons in the implanted ear demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement for those who scored up to 50% preopera-tively. Previous CI clinical trials investigating EAS have used a best-aided CNC score of ≤60% in the ear to be implanted for candidacy inclusion, and a CNC word score of ≤80% in the contralateral ear.72,89–91 These data and those from Sladen et al.82 suggest monosyllabic word recognition testing is more ecological than sentence testing and is as sensitive in predicting CI candidates. Moreover, sentence recognitions tasks are not useful for tracking CI performance outcomes over time due to the large numbers of CI users who achieve ceiling performance early during their post-operative course (60% of users scored >80% by 3 months post-CI). Con-versely, CNC scores improved signiﬁcantly at each of the time periods between surgery and 12-months post-CI with no patients scoring over 80% by the 12-month interval.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Recommendations Aided speech recognition testing should be conducted following recommended clinical guidelines outlined in the Minimum Speech Test Battery27 and Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation67 to ensure standardization across centers. To test, a speaker is situ-ated approximately 39 inches (1 meter) from the ﬂoor and the center of the listener’s head. Best aided speech recog-nition testing is deﬁned as the speech perception score in individual ear(s) using optimized hearing aid(s) on a monosyllabic word test (Consonant-nucleus-consonant, CNC).92 The target presentation level for stimuli is 60 dB A.93 When unaided hearing thresholds are 60 dB HL or better in the non-test ear, either plugging and mufﬁng or masking using speech-shaped noise is per-formed. Any patient who scores ≤50% on CNC in the poorer hearing ear should be considered for CI88 unless contraindicated by hearing history, etiology, or other per-tinent factors gathered during the CI evaluation. The CNC word score in the contralateral ear should not be considered when determining candidacy using this test.\\nImportantly, the clinical trials investigating CI for USNHL did not stipulate the CNC score in the contralateral ear.\\nIt is important to note our recommendation is to use CNC word testing to determine CI candidacy. Because CNC word scores are not used for device labeling or insurance criteria, best aided connected speech testing (best aided deﬁned as speech recognition testing in the individual ear[s] using optimized hearing aid[s]) should be performed using AzBio sentences86 to determine if a patient qualiﬁes for coverage for their CI. To date, no con-sensus exists on the SNR recommended for testing, and varies between clinics.8 Our recommendation is to test the ear to be implanted in the best aided condition using AzBio sentences in noise starting with a + 10 dB SNR using a 10-talker babble (AzBio Sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 55 dB A). To further eval-uate hearing status and to meet insurance qualiﬁcation requirements, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences presented in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (sentences in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as needed (Table II).\\nAlthough clinically signiﬁcant improvements in speech perception in noise can be achieved after implan-tation for patients qualifying for CI in noise conditions listed above, improvements tend to be smaller as SNR becomes more adverse.94,95 Speciﬁcally, persons qualify-ing for CI in only the +5 dB SNR condition can derive sig-niﬁcant beneﬁt from their device, but objective outcomes are more variable.96–98 These data provide useful counsel-ing tools for patients considering CI, but consideration of listening needs and goals should be discussed with each candidate on an individualized basis. Varying the SNR represents real-life listening situations29,96,99 and can be beneﬁcial for determining the SNR at which substantial difﬁculty is noted. Finally, testing AzBio Sentences in the person’s everyday listening condition is recommended for postoperative comparison to the person’s then everyday TABLE II.\\nMinimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB).\\nStimuli Competing Signal Aided Listening Condition Appropriate Speech Recognition Measures Left Right Bilateral Monosyllabic words in quiet (60 dBA) X X Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) Sentences in quiet (60 dBA) X X AzBio Sentences Sentences in noise (65 dBA) Multi-talker speech babble +5 to +10 dB signal to noise ratio X X X AzBio Sentences in Noise; BKB-Sentences in Noise Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 7 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

In addition, numerous authors have published on the relationship between cochlear implantation and cognitive status in patients over the age of 65.103–105 Cognitive evaluations such as the mini mental status exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), tests of verbally based stimuli and responses (i.e., digit span, Stroop), and comparable visu-ally based tests such as the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test have been evaluated. While these tests may be help-ful in assessing CI candidates and in tracking changes in cognition from pre- to post-CI, cognitive testing is not required prior to CI, and there are no recommendations for its inclusion during CI evaluation in this manuscript.\\nCertain considerations must be given to circumstances unique to the aging person. These include possible degen-eration of the central auditory system, declining cognitive status, diminished central receptive or expressive lan-guage function, and coexisting medical, ﬁne motor, and psychosocial disorders. Although none of these issues are absolute contraindications to CI, they should be discussed with the candidate and their support system (friends, family, caregivers) during the evaluation process as they may impact both expectations and outcomes.103,106,107 The medical history should include a thorough medi-cal assessment of the candidate’s comorbidities and car-diovascular health. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kid-ney failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, and coronary artery disease can safely undergo CI surgery. However, communication with the primary care physician or specialist is necessary to obtain surgical clearance and perioperative recommen-dations, which may include conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia.108–110 The evaluation must also include an otologic and neurotologic history and physical examination including microscopic otoscopy including an assessment of current and previous vestibular function.\\nUp to 35% of adults over age 40 have vestibular dysfunc-tion.111,112 Formal vestibular testing prior to CI has been advocated by some to help mitigate the risk of bilateral vestibular hypofunction following CI.113 This practice is not uniformly applied and is not mandatory.114 Further-more, no consensus exists regarding who to test or which test(s) to perform. Pre-operative vestibular testing should therefore be performed at the discretion of the implant team and/or when warranted by the patient’s history.\\nLike vestibular disturbance, the otologic history should also query for the presence of tinnitus. Although some data support the suppression of tinnitus following CI,115,116 the perception of tinnitus can persist following CI and reasonable expectations should be included as part of counseling.\\nImaging There is debate regarding the optimal imaging modality to assess cochlear, middle ear, and mastoid anatomy prior to CI surgery. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have both been used. Although the data suggest preoperative imaging rarely affects surgical decision making,117 imaging ordered in preparation for CI surgery remains at the discretion of the surgeon. Like any diag-nostic tool, cost/beneﬁt analysis and risk assessment must be considered in each case.\\nEar Selection The decision of which ear to implant is nuanced and creating a formulaic approach leading to speciﬁc recom-mendations is not possible. Often the decision is based on objective CI testing, but other factors can contribute such as patient preference, medical evaluation, preoperative imaging, duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, ampliﬁcation history, and audiometric ﬁndings.42,118,119 Although the poorer hearing ear was routinely selected in the past, dogmatic methodology should not take prece-dence in all cases over these other factors.118,120,121 This less rigid approach may lead to a recommendation for implantation of the better hearing ear in some cases when it also meets candidacy. For instance, when the examination indicates signiﬁcant pathology in one ear, implantation of the uninvolved ear (which may be the better hearing ear) is often indicated. However, in cases with an unrevealing history, normal examination and imaging, and symmetric hearing thresholds, the poorer performing ear on CI candidacy testing is routinely selected for CI.\\nVaccinations It is important that the vaccination history of CI can-didates is reviewed by the CI team. The Centers for Dis-ease Control (CDC) recommends all adult CI candidates (≥19 years old) be immunized against pneumococcal men-ingitis. The Task Force recommendation is to follow CDC guidelines prior to (and subsequent to when relevant) cochlear implantation and these guidelines are summa-rized in Table III. Vaccination recommendations may dif-fer between patients based on age, medical history, and/or previous vaccinations. Additional details regarding vaccination recommendations in CI patients can be found on the CDC website.122,123 Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 9 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License COUNSELING AND THERAPY Prior to surgery, the CI team must attempt to under-stand the patient’s goals and expectations as well as those of the caregiver(s) and others involved in the candi-date’s support system. Data suggest a patient’s expecta-tions before CI may inﬂuence their postoperative QoL after surgery, with those who report lower performance expectations showing higher postoperative QoL.124 Importantly, preoperative expectations do not appear to impact post-CI speech recognition scores.125 Although there is no validated measure to assess expectations prior to CI surgery, many CI centers have developed their own pre-operative CI questionnaire that is administered to and discussed with the candidate and their support sys-tem during the evaluation process.\\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing the real-world beneﬁts and improvements in QOL following cochlear implantation have been popularized to complement the objective information gained from speech-centered out-come measures. Examples of these PROMs include Speech, Spatial and Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ),126 and a version of the Cochlear Implant Quality of Life Proﬁle (CIQOL-35 or CIQOL-10).127 The CIQOL-35 has recently been validated and is more psychometrically sound and comprehensive than these other tests for assessing QOL in adult CI users.128 Although preoperative CIQOL-35 scores are not correlated with objective outcomes following CI and are not used for candidacy determination, collecting these data using a standardized instrument will allow large-scale QOL studies in the future. Therefore, the authors suggest the CIQOL-35 be administered pre-operatively and at 3- and 12-months post-CI. CI satisfaction has been shown to corre-late with self-assessed improvements in hearing disability, auditory perception, speech perception, and ease of commu-nication.\\nHowever, satisfaction following CI is not exclusively related to objective determinants and may also be related to positive self-esteem, less severe symptoms of depression, and the use of humor.129 Furthermore, measur-ing subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural reha-bilitation and initiate changes in CI programming to be used in various real-life listening situations.\\nAural Rehabilitation During the CI evaluation process, it is important for the hearing health professional to discuss the importance of post-operative rehabilitation following CI. The candidate’s motivation and support system to participate in rehabilita-tion services following implantation should be assessed. As more is learned about the patient’s goals, an individualized listening therapy plan can be developed and could include referrals to additional specialists (e.g., speech language pathologist). Despite evidence suggesting aural rehabilitation training exercises improve outcomes in CI recipients,130,131 formal aural rehabilitation training programs not often incorporated as part of the follow-up care. Aural rehabilita-tion can occur through the CI clinic, guided by a speech pathologist or audiologist. For centers without these ser-vices, patients can be given the appropriate materials to use at home. For those patients with computer and inter-net access, self-directed computer-based training should be encouraged as research demonstrates that doing so results in improved speech recognition and CI-related QoL.132 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Insurance Coverage It is important to recognize that ‘candidacy’ and ‘coverage’ are not synonymous. As previously discussed, TABLE III.\\nPneumococcal Meningitis Vaccination Recommendations for Adult CI Candidates and Adults Who Have Previously Received a CI.\\nPneumococcal Meningitis Vaccine 19–64 years with no previous vaccinations/unknown vaccination history Single dose PCV20 OR Single dose PCV15 followed by single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later ≥65 years Single dose PCV20 OR Single dose PCV15 followed by single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later *The incremental public health beneﬁts of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated.\\n≥1 dose of PPSV23 but no PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20 Single dose of PCV15 or PCV20 at least 1 year after last PPSV23 dose *When PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23.\\nPrevious dose of PCV13 or PCV15 but not PPSV23 Single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after dose of PCV13 or PCV15 *The incremental public health beneﬁts of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License clinical best practice dictates many candidates fall out-side of FDA-labeled indications and CMS coverage poli-cies. Although National Coverage Determination (NCD) policies published by CMS specify rigid guidelines for unaided audiometric thresholds and aided speech recog-nition testing, it is important to recognize these deﬁni-tions may be more stringent than clinical best practice. In addition, because each state administers its own Medic-aid program, differences exist in CI coverage for adults 21 years and older. As outcomes have improved and can-didacy criteria continue to broaden beyond payer guide-lines, policies and associated determination of candidacy serve to confuse the issue of candidacy versus coverage, which may restrict appropriate education and access.\\nOff-Label Considerations Off-label use of a medical device is the application of the device for a purpose not included as an indication in the FDA-approved device labeling. Clinicians often rec-ommend CI for patients falling outside of FDA-approved criteria when the advantages outweigh the disadvan-tages. Over 75% of CI surgeons in the US self-report that they perform “off-label” CI surgery.10 Off-label implanta-tion requires the clinician be well informed about the product, its use on “ﬁrm scientiﬁc rationale and sound medical evidence”, keep the patient’s best interests at the forefront of the decision-making process, and use best knowledge and judgment.\\nSUMMARY/GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CI CANDIDATES 1. Any patient with hearing loss who gains limited bene-ﬁt from their current HA(s) and desires improvement in hearing should be referred for a CI evaluation.\\nReferrals for borderline candidates, even if the candi-date does not quality, provides an opportunity for counseling and documents a baseline to monitor for future hearing loss progression.\\n2. CI should not be considered a “last resort”. Candi-dates should not wait for “something better”. CI is currently the most effective option for the manage-ment of sensorineural hearing loss not optimally managed by HAs.\\n3. The presence of residual acoustic hearing should not deter referral for CI candidacy evaluation. Residual hearing is not a contraindication for CI surgery, and if maintained following CI can lead to better speech understanding in noise, appreciation of music, and improved sound quality among other beneﬁts. In addition, EAS listening strategies can be implemented post-operatively.\\n4. Ear-speciﬁc CI candidacy must be considered as many studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt of CI in cases of UHL/SSD and AHL.\\n5. A “revised 60/60” criteria can be used as a clinical benchmark for referral for a CI evaluation whereby each ear is considered individually for CI rather than using the better ear as the reference point. If a patient has a PTA ≥60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤60% in the worse hearing ear the patient should be referred for CI evaluation. It should be remembered patients fall-ing outside the “traditional” 60/60 criteria or the “revised” 60/60 criteria may still qualify for CI and should not be excluded from CI evaluation.\\n6. Patient-speciﬁc factors must be considered in identi-fying appropriate CI candidates and can be helpful in counseling prior to surgery. These factors include demographic information, etiology of deafness, dura-tion of hearing loss, HA history, and the candidate’s physical/mental/emotional support system. Although these factors deserve consideration during the evaluation process, they are rarely absolute contrain-dications for surgery.\\n7. CI candidacy testing begins with CNC monosyllabic word testing in each ear using optimized hearing aids. Candidacy is recommended by a score of ≤50% in the ear-to-be implanted, regardless of performance in the contralateral ear. AzBio sentence recognition testing is then performed in the ear to be implanted and used to determine qualiﬁcation for insurance cov-erage. “Best aided” should be interpreted as the score for the ear considered for CI ﬁtted optimized hear-ing aids.\\n8. To determine if a candidate qualiﬁes for insurer’s cov-erage for the CI surgery and device, best aided con-nected speech testing should be performed in the ear to be implanted using AzBio sentences played with a 10-talker babble in +10 dB SNR. To further evaluate hearing status and qualiﬁcation of insurer’s require-ments, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences obtained in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (AzBio in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as appropriate.\\n9. Appropriate recommendations for ﬁtting hearing technology in the contralateral, non-implanted ear, should be discussed to allow for optimization of bin-aural hearing, use of compatible accessories, etc.\\n10. Hearing related disability can be assessed using a variety of QOL instruments. While optional and unrelated to behavioral outcomes post-CI, measuring subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural rehabilitation and initiate changes in CI program-ming based on various real-life listening situations.\\nThe CIQOL-35 is a validated questionnaire speciﬁc to CI patients, and administration is suggested pre-implantation and at 3-months and 12-months post-CI. The CIQOL-35 can be administrated annually thereafter where appropriate to ensure the patient is progressing and meeting stated goals.\\n11. Patients not meeting current FDA labeling and CMS requirements should still be considered for a CI. Evidence-based medicine should guide clinical decision making by the multidisciplinary CI team.\\nConsideration of insurance coverage should be included during counseling as a supplement to clini-cal recommendations but should not be used as deter-rent for referral for a CI evaluation or for CI candidacy.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 11 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Implementation of an aural rehabilitation program must be encouraged as it is essential to maximize outcomes following CI.\\n13. There is no “bad” CI referral. Even if a patient does not initially qualify, the evaluation process can be educational for the patient, can provide a baseline for comparison in the future, and may result in optimiza-tion of HA technology and/or the provision of assistive listening devices.\\nCONCLUSION Untreated and undertreated hearing loss can have negative effects on quality of life. Any patient unable to beneﬁt from, or who perceives dissatisfaction with ampli-ﬁcation should be referred for a formal CI evaluation.\\nCurrently, adult CI candidacy determination involves consideration of both medical and audiological criteria.\\nAppropriate identiﬁcation of CI candidates has been shown to lead to positive outcomes in multiple objective and subjective domains. Given the success of CI technol-ogy as a treatment for disabling hearing loss, it is impera-tive to expand access for all appropriate candidates.\\nThese evidence-based recommendations outline a stan-dardized method for the identiﬁcation of potential CI can-didates, and for the pre- and post-operative evaluation of objective and subjective outcomes.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT DMZ serves on the Surgical Advisory Boards for MED-EL Corporation and Advanced Bionics Corporation, is course director and faculty for Institute for Cochlear Implant Training and is a consultant for Cochlear Corpo-ration.

Prentiss, PhD ; Sarah A. Sydlowski, AuD, PhD, MBA; Camille C. Dunn, PhD, CCC-A The indications for cochlear implantation have expanded over time due to evidence demonstrating identiﬁcation and implanta-tion of appropriate cochlear implant (CI) candidates lead to signiﬁcant improvements in speech recognition and quality of life (QoL). However, clinical practice is variable, with some providers using outdated criteria and others exceeding current labeled indications. As a results, only a fraction of those persons who could beneﬁt from CI technology receive it. This document sum-marizes the current evidence for determining appropriate referrals for adults with bilateral hearing loss into CI centers for for-mal evaluation by stressing the importance of treating each ear individually and a “revised 60/60 rule”. By mirroring contemporary clinical practice and available evidence, these recommendations will also provide a standardized testing protocol for CI candidates using a team-based approach that prioritizes individualized patient care. This manuscript was developed by the Adult Cochlear Implantation Candidacy Task Force of the American Cochlear Implant Alliance using review of the existing literature and clinical consensus.\\nKey Words: adult, candidacy, cochlear implant, evidence, protocol, recommendation.\\nLevel of Evidence: N/A Laryngoscope, 00:1–14, 2023 BACKGROUND Over the last several decades, improvements in cochlear implant (CI) technology, increased awareness of the technology, and changes in candidacy criteria have led to a rapid growth of evidence in the literature regard-ing the beneﬁt of CI in adults. As such, recommendations for CI candidacy and referral continue to evolve. For instance, unlike historical CI recipients with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), CI candi-dates may now have an audiogram that mirrors or over-laps that seen in a hearing aid (HA) candidate and may have hearing in the contralateral ear up to and including normal hearing. Yet, the low utilization of CIs suggests hearing health care providers unfamiliar with current candidacy criteria may be relying on older, stricter criteria for referring potential CI candidates.\\nTo assist in the standardization of practice, CI man-ufacturers have relied upon device labeling from national healthcare governing bodies (i.e., Food and Drug Administration (FDA)). However, labeling has not kept pace with clinical practice. Many commercial payers use FDA labeling to inform their coverage policies, while the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a coverage determination policy that dictates payment for CI services. As a result, some patients who may beneﬁt from CI technology yet fall outside of FDA labeling and/or CMS candidacy criteria are prevented from pursuing the technology. The inconsistency among clinical best prac-tice, labeling, and coverage determination policies can create wide variability in practice methods and may lead to the inconsistent provision of CI services on a national, regional, and even a local level. Using established evi-dence, the recommendations summarized in this manu-script will serve to standardize the approach and testing protocol for determining adult candidacy for a CI and highlight the importance of a multi-disciplinary team-based approach for individualized patient care.\\nUNDERUTILIZATION OF COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION An estimated 466 million persons worldwide live with disabling hearing loss (>6.1% of the world’s popula-tion).\\nOver 40 million people in the United States (US) alone suffer from disabling hearing loss (4.6%).1,2 In persons 12-years-and-older, the prevalence of bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss is estimated to be approx-imately two million1 making hearing loss the third most prevalent chronic health condition in the US.1–3 With the advent of the ﬁrst multi-channel CI system in 1985, guidelines requiring bilateral severe-to-profound SNHL to qualify for CI became the standard of care.

However, as of 2015, 170,252 US adults have been implanted out of an estimated 1,337,144 traditional audiometric CI candidates for a utilization rate of 12.7%.4 Moreover, fewer than 1 million devices have been implanted worldwide.5 The under-penetration of CIs among adult candi-dates is multifactorial and may in part be explained by poor awareness among clinicians and consumers alike.\\nUnfamiliarity with current candidacy criteria, lack of awareness of referral processes and clear referral path-ways to a CI center, and ﬁnancial incentives to sell hear-ing instruments may all contribute.6,7 In addition, hearing healthcare providers currently performing adult CI evaluations demonstrate considerable variability in their testing methodologies and in the deﬁnition of a “good candidate”, leading to inconsistent referrals.8 Last, patients unaware of CI technology, or those unfamiliar with candidacy criteria, may lack the impetus to discuss their options for hearing rehabilitation with their pri-mary care physician, and vice versa. Collectively, these factors likely result in missed opportunities for persons with hearing impairment to be considered for CI.9 As technology has improved and outcomes data have been analyzed, candidacy has gradually expanded to include patients with increasing amounts of residual acoustic hearing and higher aided speech recognition scores (Table I). Evidence now demonstrates FDA device labeling is not always consistent with current clinical practice. An increasing number of patients with hearing loss who fall outside of labeling guidelines are receiving CIs10 and often demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt.11 For example, increasing numbers of patients with asymmetric SNHL (ASNHL) are undergoing CI in their poorer hear-ing ear and demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt in both the implanted ear only condition and when using the CI and the contralateral HA together (bimodal, binaural condition).11–14 In addition, adults with unilateral severe-to-profound SNHL (USNHL) in the poorer ear and thresholds better than or equal to 20 dB HL in the unaf-fected ear (single-sided deafness; SSD) are now undergo-ing CI, and the results have been positive.15–18 Recipients demonstrate improved speech understanding in noise, improved sound source localization, reduction in tinnitus, improved QoL, and increased quality of hearing compared with other available technologies for SSD such as bone conduction implants and contralateral routing of signal HAs.19–24 Furthermore, using a CI in one ear does not alter or decrease performance on the contralateral side, even in cases of normal acoustic hearing.25,26 There have been two versions of a recommended Minimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB)27 and a third is currently in development. Although both versions recom-mend inclusion of a variety of test conditions (ear-speciﬁc and bilaterally aided; sentences in quiet and both ﬁxed and pseudo-adaptive noise, and monosyllabic words), the suggested materials have evolved over time. Speciﬁcally, HINT sentences were replaced by AzBio Sentences28 which were shown to be more ecologically valid.29 How-ever, the MSTB never speciﬁcally suggested how to use the recommended materials to determine CI candidacy.\\nAs the criteria for CI continue to broaden, the materials and methods used to test potential CI candidates remain highly variable and open to interpretation, even for tradi-tional, bilaterally deafened candidates.8 This variability has led to inconsistencies between testing centers making comparison of objective outcomes between patients more difﬁcult and may impair the successful prognostication of postoperative outcomes.30 In addition to objective measures, such as speech recognition scores and severity of hearing loss, determin-ing whether a patient is a CI candidate relies on a cen-ter’s familiarity with outcomes, expanding criteria, and comfort recommending implantation for those outside of FDA indications. Although a few authors have published evidence-based criteria for recommending a CI,31 there is limited guidance regarding how other factors such as cog-nitive ability, willingness to participate in an aural reha-bilitation program, duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation use among others should be used in the can-didacy process.\\nBy developing and implementing standardized rec-ommendations for assessing and conﬁrming CI candidacy, uniformity in testing protocols will be improved, the num-ber of potential CI recipients referred for testing will be increased, and consistency between those considered CI candidates amongst centers will be enhanced. Ultimately this standardization will lead to increased penetration of CI technology to those who could most beneﬁt.\\nMETHODS The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based rec-ommendations for CI candidacy identiﬁcation and referrals based on a comprehensive review of the literature. The recom-mendations encompassed in this article were developed following a predetermined methodological approach which included: (1) determining the need for a set of formal recommendations regarding adult cochlear implant candidacy and navigation of the CI referral pathway by the American Cochlear Implant Alli-ance (ACI Alliance) Board of Directors (BOD); (2) the formation of a team of subject matter experts in the ﬁeld to serve as co-authors and the designation of a lead author; (3) numerous teleconferences to establish the rationale and methodology for development of the recommendations; (4) performing a compre-hensive literature review assisted by medical librarians identify-ing the most up-to-date and state-of-the-art manuscripts on the topics of CI candidacy and referral guidelines; (5) the formation of the recommendations and the creation of an evidence-based pathway as guided by assimilation of the data based on the liter-ature review; (6) a period of review and public comment by the ACI Alliance BOD followed by a unanimous vote of endorsement.\\nThe comprehensive literature review was conducted with the help of medical librarians using a combination of keywords related to cochlear implants from multiple databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Dyna Med, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The articles were reviewed by the authors based on relevance and strength of evidence. The relevant articles were grouped into subtopics (i.e., aided speech recognition testing, can-didacy referral recommendations), and the recommendations were formulated based upon discussion, analysis, and data syn-thesis by all authors.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 3 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Several authors have published parameters to help determine the appropriateness of an adult CI referral and predict the likelihood the candidate will qualify. Gubbels et al. used audiometric ﬁndings to identify patients who are likely to meet CI candidacy fol-lowing formal testing.32 Speciﬁcally, patients with low frequency (250, 500, 1000 Hz) thresholds greater than 75 dB HL and/or a monosyllabic word recognition test score of <40% have a greater than 80% probability of meeting CMS criteria at the time of publication (i.e., <40% sentence recognition score bilaterally in the best-aided condition). When using only a monosyllabic word score <32%, 86% of the patients met CMS criteria.\\nIn patients with private insurance, the accuracy of the model remained strong (>80%) if the monosyllabic word recognition test score was <45%.\\nZwolan et al. performed a similar analysis in which audiometric data were used to predict patients who would qualify for CI under the same CMS criteria.33 When only those patients who met traditional CI indications (i.e., consistent with Medicare coverage guidelines of <40% bilateral sentence recognition score at the time of study publication) were considered, 95% had a preopera-tive pure-tone-average (PTA) in their better hearing ear of 60 dB HL or greater and 92% had an unaided monosyl-labic word score of 60% or lower. When applied retrospec-tively to a large sample of adult CI candidates, this “60/60 guideline” yielded a 96% sensitivity rate (i.e., candidates met both criteria) and a 65% speciﬁcity rate (i.e., non-candidates did not meet the 60/60 criteria).\\nAlthough the Zwolan paper uses a 60/60 guideline in the better hearing ear as a guideline for referral, due to FDA approval for cochlear implantation in cases of asym-metrical hearing loss and single-sided deafness, a “revised 60/60 guideline” is recommended where post-lingually deafened adults are referred for CI evaluations when one or both ears demonstrate a monosyllabic word score that is less than or equal to 60% correct and the unaided PTA (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) is greater than or equal to 60 dB HL. It is important clinicians recognize use of this guideline will only capture the most clear-cut CI candidates and may overlook candidates who still meet FDA criteria with steeply sloping hearing loss.\\nUsing objective audiological data will help hearing health professionals make high-yield and appropriate CI evaluation referrals. However, it is important to recognize that other studies demonstrate a poor correlation between unaided speech recognition scores and eventual CI candidacy.34 Therefore, if a patient demonstrates lim-ited beneﬁt from appropriately ﬁt hearing aids, it is important to consider referral for a formal CI evaluation regardless of the performance on any single test or group of testing measures.\\nIn summary, hearing health professionals should use the revised 60/60 guideline and refer any patient with an unaided PTA of 60 dB HL or greater and an unaided word score of 60% or less in one or both ears for formal CI evaluation. Importantly, those patients falling outside of the revised 60/60 guideline or those falling outside of tra-ditional CI labeling who do not receive adequate beneﬁt from their current technology (i.e., unilateral SNHL, asymmetric SNHL, low frequency thresholds in the nor-mal to mild range) should also be referred for a formal CI evaluation. Although other information will be reviewed by the CI team prior to candidacy determination, using audiometric parameters such as these ensures a greater number of potential CI candidates will undergo consider-ation. If the patient is deemed a non-candidate following formal CI candidacy evaluation, the referring hearing health professional should monitor the patient’s perfor-mance and re-refer with worsening performance or ongo-ing hearing difﬁculties.\\nCOCHLEAR IMPLANT CANDIDACY CONSIDERATIONS The adult CI candidacy evaluation should involve a multi-disciplinary team with experience treating CI patients. Typically, a CI team includes a CI surgeon(s) and audiologist(s) specializing in CI. Based on the com-plexity of the candidate’s case, the pre-, peri-, and/or post-operative needs of the candidate, and/or the customs of a particular CI center, additional team members may include a rehabilitation specialist (auditory-based thera-pist), a neuro-radiologist, psychologists/neuropsycholo-gists, social worker(s), previously implanted peers, and family members/caregivers.\\nIn addition to audiometric thresholds and aided sen-tence recognition in quiet,8,34 other information must be obtained during the hearing health history including ear-speciﬁc aided speech recognition using monosyllabic words and sentences in noise, etiology and duration of hearing loss, history of ampliﬁcation, patient’s occupation and/or social hearing needs, demographics (i.e., social support, age, hearing needs such as occupation), decre-ment in hearing speciﬁc and/or overall quality of life (QoL), motivation, and underlying medical factors.\\nAlthough speciﬁc recommendations based on these vari-ables may differ between individual clinics, this holistic approach towards the CI candidate has been shown to be beneﬁcial as part of healthy aging in CI recipi-ents35 (Fig. 1).\\nMultiple hearing health variables have been shown to correlate with CI outcomes including duration of deafness,36–41 HA usage,42 age at implantation,43 and eti-ology of hearing loss.36,39,42 There is evidence that addi-tional demographic variables may also be determinants of Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 4 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

Tang and colleagues44 showed factors including cohabitation with a spouse or family member(s), familiarity with technology, emotional intelligence, and adherence to postoperative aural reha-bilitation programs can inﬂuence speech outcomes follow-ing CI. Therefore, during the CI evaluation process it is critical to discuss factors such as resources available to the CI candidate and family, a family’s willingness to pro-vide a strong support system, a commitment to post-implantation (re)habilitation, the proximity of the patient to the CI audiologist and/or qualiﬁed (re)habilitation pro-vider, and the willingness and ability of the patient to wear the device.\\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND HEARING NEEDS Although a diagnostic audiogram provides objective information, it does not accurately represent the patient’s functional status as a result of their hearing loss. Speciﬁ-cally, it does not reﬂect the impact the hearing loss has on the patient in their everyday life (i.e., auditory fatigue, cognitive load, etc.) resulting from routine communication disabilities. It is well known that severe-to-profound hearing loss can have signiﬁcant consequences on one’s mental health, social inclusivity, and overall QoL.45 Research demonstrates the advantages CIs have over HAs on the recipient’s QoL in multiple domains including psychosocial health, functional health, and social inclu-sion.46,47 Despite the superiority of CI over HAs in these domains and others, CI penetration in the US has remained stagnant.9 Some evidence even suggests that the duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss prior to CI surgery is increasing, further exacerbating the delete-rious effects on the patient’s QoL.48 Although a CI may not be the optimal approach for every patient who qualiﬁes audiometrically, understanding each person’s hearing needs, communication goals, and QoL detriment are essential in providing additional insight for counsel-ing on realistic expectations. Furthermore, each candi-date must demonstrate a motivation for and commitment to the entire CI process.\\nAUDIOLOGIC EVALUATION Hearing History Obtaining an accurate and comprehensive hearing health history is critical to identifying appropriate CI candidates and understanding factors that may inﬂuence outcomes post-operatively. Information regarding the eti-ology of hearing loss (if known), rate of hearing loss pro-gression (supplemented by prior audiometric testing where available), history of ampliﬁcation, otologic history (i.e., prior operations and/or pathology), and post-implant expectations must be obtained during the clinic evalua-tion. In addition, age at onset of hearing loss and its rela-tionship to language acquisition must be queried as these factors may help predict postoperative outcomes and/or device use compliance.49,50 Speciﬁcally, adult candidates with pre-lingual onset of deafness demonstrate large inter-individual performance variability and levels of sat-isfaction and may be at increased risk for device non-use.51,52 Careful attention to duration of deafness is essential when discussing realistic expectations with the candidate.\\nDuration of deafness can be difﬁcult to accurately assess in some patients. An understanding of the estimated amount of time that the inner ear and auditory cortex has been without meaningful stimulation is critical as it is an important predictor of post-operative objective suc-cess.\\nLack of stimulation may be due to severe-to-profound hearing loss, lack of adequate ampliﬁcation, and/or failure to engage in auditory-rich environments.\\nAs discussed above, longer durations of post-lingual deaf-ness are associated with poorer outcomes after CI.36–41 However, successful outcomes following CI in cases of prolonged durations of deafness (>30 years) have been reported.53 Therefore, duration of deafness in bilaterally deafened adults with a post-lingual onset should not be an absolute contraindication for CI, but rather an impor-tant consideration in setting appropriate post-implantation expectations.\\nIn addition to age of onset and duration of deafness, the duration and consistency of ampliﬁcation use in impaired ears must be determined. Even with consistent ampliﬁcation, long-term severe-to-profound hearing loss can lead to auditory deprivation and may impact out-comes following CI.40,41,54 Critically, the ﬁt and settings of current ampliﬁcation must be veriﬁed by the CI audiol-ogist as many potential CI candidates arrive with inap-propriately ﬁt HAs at the time of the evaluation.8 The etiology of the candidate’s hearing loss should be obtained and documented. CI outcomes can vary widely among recipients based on the etiology of hearing loss and must be reviewed with the patient.55–59 Fig. 1.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Although very few etiologies of deafness are contraindica-tions to CI surgery, they may impact expected outcomes and must be considered when discussing realistic expec-tations with the patient.\\nDuring the hearing health history, the CI candidate should be asked to share the impact the hearing loss has on their daily life. It is important to understand how the hearing loss impairs or affects the candidate’s ability to work, communicate with friends and family, or interact socially. It is helpful to ask patient-speciﬁc, closed-ended questions that clarify the impact of their hearing loss (i.e., “Can you use a telephone with one or both ears?”, “Can you watch television without subtitles?”, “Can you go out to dinner with friends and keep up with the con-versation?”, “Do you feel your HAs provide sufﬁcient ben-eﬁt?”).\\nMany clinics are using validated screening questionnaires such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Test (HHIE-S)60 to better understand the impact of the candidate’s hearing loss.\\nThis should be repeated post-operatively and shared with the patient by discussing areas of beneﬁt and areas that the patient could beneﬁt from additional rehabilitation.\\nDiagnostic Unaided Audiologic Evaluation A diagnostic audiogram is required as part of CI can-didacy assessment. Objective assessment of the ear under consideration for CI as well as the contralateral ear is important for managing post-operative expecta-tions for residual hearing,61 determining electrode array selection,62–64 determining the optimal surgical approach,65 consideration for the use of intraoperative tools such as electrocochleography (ECochG),66 and future ampliﬁcation of the implanted or non-implanted ear. Results of the diagnostic audiogram must be used together with the other components of the CI evalua-tion discussed below as part of a holistic candidacy approach (see above) (Fig. 1).\\nConsistent with the Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation, a standard set of mea-sures must be performed and documented for each patient.67 Pre-operative air conduction (AC) pure tone thresholds including 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz are performed via insert earphones for each ear. Bone conduction (BC) pure tone thresholds including 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz are performed for each ear. High frequency AC thresholds (2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz) are often in the severe-to-profound range and may not be measurable using standard audiometry.\\nThese are assigned the value of 120 dB for documentation purposes.\\nSigniﬁcant residual low-frequency hearing in either ear (but especially in the ear-to-be-implanted) should not serve as an exclusion for CI candidacy. When low fre-quency thresholds (125, 250, and 500 Hz) are in the normal-to-moderately-severe range, hearing preservation is possible following CI. Electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) using an acoustic component with a CI ear-level sound processor should be considered and discussed if functional hearing preservation is achieved. Functional hearing is deﬁned as hearing in the low frequency thresholds that can be adequately ampliﬁed (i.e., meeting targets on real-ear measurements). Patients using acous-tic plus electric hearing demonstrate improved speech perception outcomes,68 speech understanding in noise,69–72 binaural cues such as summation and squelch,73 sound source localization,70,74 melody recogni-tion and music appreciation,69,75,76 and perceived quality of speech.77 Other objective measures such as tympanometry and acoustic reﬂex thresholds are performed when clinically indicated to screen for the presence of middle ear dysfunc-tion (i.e., middle ear atelectasis, chronic serous otitis, acute otitis media, etc.).78 Although not a contraindica-tion to CI surgery, middle ear dysfunction may delay the implantation process and/or affect the decision regarding which ear to implant.\\nUnaided Speech Recognition Testing As previously discussed, unaided speech recognition testing has historically served as a guide for CI referral.\\nSigniﬁcant variability exists in the testing methodologies (i.e., presentation level, recorded vs. monitored live voice, number of stimuli). Without standardization, the reliabil-ity of using unaided testing to identify CI candidates is diminished and the ability to compare results between practices is mitigated. The recommendation for best prac-tice is to use recorded speech measures. When a patient is non-English-speaking, recommendation for CI evalua-tion may be made based on pure tone audiometry and reported ampliﬁcation beneﬁt.\\nHearing Aid Fitting and Evaluation CI candidacy evaluations must be performed using appropriately ﬁtted and veriﬁed HAs. The term ‘appro-priately ﬁtted and veriﬁed’ refers to the use of real-ear or simulated real-ear measures conducted in a test box or on-ear to conﬁrm the devices meet prescriptive targets for sufﬁcient audibility (i.e., DSL adult, NAL-NL1).79,80 Veriﬁcation can be performed on the patient’s personal hearing instruments or clinic-owned instruments programmed to the patient’s most recent hearing test.81 For CI candidates with underﬁt or poorly ﬁt HAs (e.g., +/\\u0001 >5 dB from the prescriptive targets), the audiol-ogist will make recommendations regarding appropriate adjustments. Functional aided thresholds to determine audibility with the HA(s) can be included but are not essential and should not be the only veriﬁcation method used.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Historically, sentence recognition testing has been the standard for aided speech measures in CI candidacy testing (Table I). However, Sladen and colleagues82 sug-gest sentence recognition scores less reﬂect how well a person can detect and process spectral and temporal com-ponents of speech, and more about how well one can use “top-down processing” to “ﬁll in missing pieces”. Top-down processing can also be altered by cognitive Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 6 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License resources.83,84 Previous studies show that post-lingually deafened adults score much higher on sentence testing than on word testing during CI evaluation.85,86 Previous work demonstrates when monosyllabic word recognition scores are used for CI candidacy qualiﬁ-cation, performance outcomes show signiﬁcant improve-ment from pre- to post-CI. Furthermore, Sladen et al.82 showed a trend for improved performance on CNC word testing when less restrictive criteria (<40% CNC) are used for candidacy qualiﬁcation rather than more restric-tive criteria (<30% CNC).87 Data from Dunn et al.88 dem-onstrate in patients with bilateral deafness who undergo implantation in their worse ear, using a CNC score of ≤50% in the ear to be implanted had a 99.7% sensitivity for identifying candidates who ultimately qualiﬁed based on previous CMS criteria (≤40% sentence recognition testing). Pre to Postoperative CNC word score compari-sons in the implanted ear demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement for those who scored up to 50% preopera-tively. Previous CI clinical trials investigating EAS have used a best-aided CNC score of ≤60% in the ear to be implanted for candidacy inclusion, and a CNC word score of ≤80% in the contralateral ear.72,89–91 These data and those from Sladen et al.82 suggest monosyllabic word recognition testing is more ecological than sentence testing and is as sensitive in predicting CI candidates. Moreover, sentence recognitions tasks are not useful for tracking CI performance outcomes over time due to the large numbers of CI users who achieve ceiling performance early during their post-operative course (60% of users scored >80% by 3 months post-CI). Con-versely, CNC scores improved signiﬁcantly at each of the time periods between surgery and 12-months post-CI with no patients scoring over 80% by the 12-month interval.\\nAided Speech Recognition Testing Recommendations Aided speech recognition testing should be conducted following recommended clinical guidelines outlined in the Minimum Speech Test Battery27 and Minimum Reporting Standards for Adult Cochlear Implantation67 to ensure standardization across centers. To test, a speaker is situ-ated approximately 39 inches (1 meter) from the ﬂoor and the center of the listener’s head. Best aided speech recog-nition testing is deﬁned as the speech perception score in individual ear(s) using optimized hearing aid(s) on a monosyllabic word test (Consonant-nucleus-consonant, CNC).92 The target presentation level for stimuli is 60 dB A.93 When unaided hearing thresholds are 60 dB HL or better in the non-test ear, either plugging and mufﬁng or masking using speech-shaped noise is per-formed. Any patient who scores ≤50% on CNC in the poorer hearing ear should be considered for CI88 unless contraindicated by hearing history, etiology, or other per-tinent factors gathered during the CI evaluation. The CNC word score in the contralateral ear should not be considered when determining candidacy using this test.\\nImportantly, the clinical trials investigating CI for USNHL did not stipulate the CNC score in the contralateral ear.\\nIt is important to note our recommendation is to use CNC word testing to determine CI candidacy. Because CNC word scores are not used for device labeling or insurance criteria, best aided connected speech testing (best aided deﬁned as speech recognition testing in the individual ear[s] using optimized hearing aid[s]) should be performed using AzBio sentences86 to determine if a patient qualiﬁes for coverage for their CI. To date, no con-sensus exists on the SNR recommended for testing, and varies between clinics.8 Our recommendation is to test the ear to be implanted in the best aided condition using AzBio sentences in noise starting with a + 10 dB SNR using a 10-talker babble (AzBio Sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 55 dB A). To further eval-uate hearing status and to meet insurance qualiﬁcation requirements, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences presented in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (sentences in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as needed (Table II).\\nAlthough clinically signiﬁcant improvements in speech perception in noise can be achieved after implan-tation for patients qualifying for CI in noise conditions listed above, improvements tend to be smaller as SNR becomes more adverse.94,95 Speciﬁcally, persons qualify-ing for CI in only the +5 dB SNR condition can derive sig-niﬁcant beneﬁt from their device, but objective outcomes are more variable.96–98 These data provide useful counsel-ing tools for patients considering CI, but consideration of listening needs and goals should be discussed with each candidate on an individualized basis. Varying the SNR represents real-life listening situations29,96,99 and can be beneﬁcial for determining the SNR at which substantial difﬁculty is noted. Finally, testing AzBio Sentences in the person’s everyday listening condition is recommended for postoperative comparison to the person’s then everyday TABLE II.\\nMinimum Speech Test Battery (MSTB).\\nStimuli Competing Signal Aided Listening Condition Appropriate Speech Recognition Measures Left Right Bilateral Monosyllabic words in quiet (60 dBA) X X Consonant Nucleus Consonant (CNC) Sentences in quiet (60 dBA) X X AzBio Sentences Sentences in noise (65 dBA) Multi-talker speech babble +5 to +10 dB signal to noise ratio X X X AzBio Sentences in Noise; BKB-Sentences in Noise Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 7 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023].

In addition, numerous authors have published on the relationship between cochlear implantation and cognitive status in patients over the age of 65.103–105 Cognitive evaluations such as the mini mental status exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), tests of verbally based stimuli and responses (i.e., digit span, Stroop), and comparable visu-ally based tests such as the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test have been evaluated. While these tests may be help-ful in assessing CI candidates and in tracking changes in cognition from pre- to post-CI, cognitive testing is not required prior to CI, and there are no recommendations for its inclusion during CI evaluation in this manuscript.\\nCertain considerations must be given to circumstances unique to the aging person. These include possible degen-eration of the central auditory system, declining cognitive status, diminished central receptive or expressive lan-guage function, and coexisting medical, ﬁne motor, and psychosocial disorders. Although none of these issues are absolute contraindications to CI, they should be discussed with the candidate and their support system (friends, family, caregivers) during the evaluation process as they may impact both expectations and outcomes.103,106,107 The medical history should include a thorough medi-cal assessment of the candidate’s comorbidities and car-diovascular health. Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kid-ney failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, and coronary artery disease can safely undergo CI surgery. However, communication with the primary care physician or specialist is necessary to obtain surgical clearance and perioperative recommen-dations, which may include conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia.108–110 The evaluation must also include an otologic and neurotologic history and physical examination including microscopic otoscopy including an assessment of current and previous vestibular function.\\nUp to 35% of adults over age 40 have vestibular dysfunc-tion.111,112 Formal vestibular testing prior to CI has been advocated by some to help mitigate the risk of bilateral vestibular hypofunction following CI.113 This practice is not uniformly applied and is not mandatory.114 Further-more, no consensus exists regarding who to test or which test(s) to perform. Pre-operative vestibular testing should therefore be performed at the discretion of the implant team and/or when warranted by the patient’s history.\\nLike vestibular disturbance, the otologic history should also query for the presence of tinnitus. Although some data support the suppression of tinnitus following CI,115,116 the perception of tinnitus can persist following CI and reasonable expectations should be included as part of counseling.\\nImaging There is debate regarding the optimal imaging modality to assess cochlear, middle ear, and mastoid anatomy prior to CI surgery. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have both been used. Although the data suggest preoperative imaging rarely affects surgical decision making,117 imaging ordered in preparation for CI surgery remains at the discretion of the surgeon. Like any diag-nostic tool, cost/beneﬁt analysis and risk assessment must be considered in each case.\\nEar Selection The decision of which ear to implant is nuanced and creating a formulaic approach leading to speciﬁc recom-mendations is not possible. Often the decision is based on objective CI testing, but other factors can contribute such as patient preference, medical evaluation, preoperative imaging, duration of severe-to-profound hearing loss, ampliﬁcation history, and audiometric ﬁndings.42,118,119 Although the poorer hearing ear was routinely selected in the past, dogmatic methodology should not take prece-dence in all cases over these other factors.118,120,121 This less rigid approach may lead to a recommendation for implantation of the better hearing ear in some cases when it also meets candidacy. For instance, when the examination indicates signiﬁcant pathology in one ear, implantation of the uninvolved ear (which may be the better hearing ear) is often indicated. However, in cases with an unrevealing history, normal examination and imaging, and symmetric hearing thresholds, the poorer performing ear on CI candidacy testing is routinely selected for CI.\\nVaccinations It is important that the vaccination history of CI can-didates is reviewed by the CI team. The Centers for Dis-ease Control (CDC) recommends all adult CI candidates (≥19 years old) be immunized against pneumococcal men-ingitis. The Task Force recommendation is to follow CDC guidelines prior to (and subsequent to when relevant) cochlear implantation and these guidelines are summa-rized in Table III. Vaccination recommendations may dif-fer between patients based on age, medical history, and/or previous vaccinations. Additional details regarding vaccination recommendations in CI patients can be found on the CDC website.122,123 Laryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 9 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License COUNSELING AND THERAPY Prior to surgery, the CI team must attempt to under-stand the patient’s goals and expectations as well as those of the caregiver(s) and others involved in the candi-date’s support system. Data suggest a patient’s expecta-tions before CI may inﬂuence their postoperative QoL after surgery, with those who report lower performance expectations showing higher postoperative QoL.124 Importantly, preoperative expectations do not appear to impact post-CI speech recognition scores.125 Although there is no validated measure to assess expectations prior to CI surgery, many CI centers have developed their own pre-operative CI questionnaire that is administered to and discussed with the candidate and their support sys-tem during the evaluation process.\\nPatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing the real-world beneﬁts and improvements in QOL following cochlear implantation have been popularized to complement the objective information gained from speech-centered out-come measures. Examples of these PROMs include Speech, Spatial and Qualities Questionnaire (SSQ),126 and a version of the Cochlear Implant Quality of Life Proﬁle (CIQOL-35 or CIQOL-10).127 The CIQOL-35 has recently been validated and is more psychometrically sound and comprehensive than these other tests for assessing QOL in adult CI users.128 Although preoperative CIQOL-35 scores are not correlated with objective outcomes following CI and are not used for candidacy determination, collecting these data using a standardized instrument will allow large-scale QOL studies in the future. Therefore, the authors suggest the CIQOL-35 be administered pre-operatively and at 3- and 12-months post-CI. CI satisfaction has been shown to corre-late with self-assessed improvements in hearing disability, auditory perception, speech perception, and ease of commu-nication.\\nHowever, satisfaction following CI is not exclusively related to objective determinants and may also be related to positive self-esteem, less severe symptoms of depression, and the use of humor.129 Furthermore, measur-ing subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural reha-bilitation and initiate changes in CI programming to be used in various real-life listening situations.\\nAural Rehabilitation During the CI evaluation process, it is important for the hearing health professional to discuss the importance of post-operative rehabilitation following CI. The candidate’s motivation and support system to participate in rehabilita-tion services following implantation should be assessed. As more is learned about the patient’s goals, an individualized listening therapy plan can be developed and could include referrals to additional specialists (e.g., speech language pathologist). Despite evidence suggesting aural rehabilitation training exercises improve outcomes in CI recipients,130,131 formal aural rehabilitation training programs not often incorporated as part of the follow-up care. Aural rehabilita-tion can occur through the CI clinic, guided by a speech pathologist or audiologist. For centers without these ser-vices, patients can be given the appropriate materials to use at home. For those patients with computer and inter-net access, self-directed computer-based training should be encouraged as research demonstrates that doing so results in improved speech recognition and CI-related QoL.132 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Insurance Coverage It is important to recognize that ‘candidacy’ and ‘coverage’ are not synonymous. As previously discussed, TABLE III.\\nPneumococcal Meningitis Vaccination Recommendations for Adult CI Candidates and Adults Who Have Previously Received a CI.\\nPneumococcal Meningitis Vaccine 19–64 years with no previous vaccinations/unknown vaccination history Single dose PCV20 OR Single dose PCV15 followed by single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later ≥65 years Single dose PCV20 OR Single dose PCV15 followed by single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later *The incremental public health beneﬁts of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated.\\n≥1 dose of PPSV23 but no PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20 Single dose of PCV15 or PCV20 at least 1 year after last PPSV23 dose *When PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23.\\nPrevious dose of PCV13 or PCV15 but not PPSV23 Single dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after dose of PCV13 or PCV15 *The incremental public health beneﬁts of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License clinical best practice dictates many candidates fall out-side of FDA-labeled indications and CMS coverage poli-cies. Although National Coverage Determination (NCD) policies published by CMS specify rigid guidelines for unaided audiometric thresholds and aided speech recog-nition testing, it is important to recognize these deﬁni-tions may be more stringent than clinical best practice. In addition, because each state administers its own Medic-aid program, differences exist in CI coverage for adults 21 years and older. As outcomes have improved and can-didacy criteria continue to broaden beyond payer guide-lines, policies and associated determination of candidacy serve to confuse the issue of candidacy versus coverage, which may restrict appropriate education and access.\\nOff-Label Considerations Off-label use of a medical device is the application of the device for a purpose not included as an indication in the FDA-approved device labeling. Clinicians often rec-ommend CI for patients falling outside of FDA-approved criteria when the advantages outweigh the disadvan-tages. Over 75% of CI surgeons in the US self-report that they perform “off-label” CI surgery.10 Off-label implanta-tion requires the clinician be well informed about the product, its use on “ﬁrm scientiﬁc rationale and sound medical evidence”, keep the patient’s best interests at the forefront of the decision-making process, and use best knowledge and judgment.\\nSUMMARY/GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CI CANDIDATES 1. Any patient with hearing loss who gains limited bene-ﬁt from their current HA(s) and desires improvement in hearing should be referred for a CI evaluation.\\nReferrals for borderline candidates, even if the candi-date does not quality, provides an opportunity for counseling and documents a baseline to monitor for future hearing loss progression.\\n2. CI should not be considered a “last resort”. Candi-dates should not wait for “something better”. CI is currently the most effective option for the manage-ment of sensorineural hearing loss not optimally managed by HAs.\\n3. The presence of residual acoustic hearing should not deter referral for CI candidacy evaluation. Residual hearing is not a contraindication for CI surgery, and if maintained following CI can lead to better speech understanding in noise, appreciation of music, and improved sound quality among other beneﬁts. In addition, EAS listening strategies can be implemented post-operatively.\\n4. Ear-speciﬁc CI candidacy must be considered as many studies have demonstrated the beneﬁt of CI in cases of UHL/SSD and AHL.\\n5. A “revised 60/60” criteria can be used as a clinical benchmark for referral for a CI evaluation whereby each ear is considered individually for CI rather than using the better ear as the reference point. If a patient has a PTA ≥60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤60% in the worse hearing ear the patient should be referred for CI evaluation. It should be remembered patients fall-ing outside the “traditional” 60/60 criteria or the “revised” 60/60 criteria may still qualify for CI and should not be excluded from CI evaluation.\\n6. Patient-speciﬁc factors must be considered in identi-fying appropriate CI candidates and can be helpful in counseling prior to surgery. These factors include demographic information, etiology of deafness, dura-tion of hearing loss, HA history, and the candidate’s physical/mental/emotional support system. Although these factors deserve consideration during the evaluation process, they are rarely absolute contrain-dications for surgery.\\n7. CI candidacy testing begins with CNC monosyllabic word testing in each ear using optimized hearing aids. Candidacy is recommended by a score of ≤50% in the ear-to-be implanted, regardless of performance in the contralateral ear. AzBio sentence recognition testing is then performed in the ear to be implanted and used to determine qualiﬁcation for insurance cov-erage. “Best aided” should be interpreted as the score for the ear considered for CI ﬁtted optimized hear-ing aids.\\n8. To determine if a candidate qualiﬁes for insurer’s cov-erage for the CI surgery and device, best aided con-nected speech testing should be performed in the ear to be implanted using AzBio sentences played with a 10-talker babble in +10 dB SNR. To further evaluate hearing status and qualiﬁcation of insurer’s require-ments, the clinician should consider decreasing the adversity (sentences obtained in quiet at 60 dB A) or increasing the adversity (AzBio in +5 dB SNR with sentences presented at 65 dB A and noise presented at 60 dB A) of the listening condition as appropriate.\\n9. Appropriate recommendations for ﬁtting hearing technology in the contralateral, non-implanted ear, should be discussed to allow for optimization of bin-aural hearing, use of compatible accessories, etc.\\n10. Hearing related disability can be assessed using a variety of QOL instruments. While optional and unrelated to behavioral outcomes post-CI, measuring subjective beneﬁt can guide counseling and aural rehabilitation and initiate changes in CI program-ming based on various real-life listening situations.\\nThe CIQOL-35 is a validated questionnaire speciﬁc to CI patients, and administration is suggested pre-implantation and at 3-months and 12-months post-CI. The CIQOL-35 can be administrated annually thereafter where appropriate to ensure the patient is progressing and meeting stated goals.\\n11. Patients not meeting current FDA labeling and CMS requirements should still be considered for a CI. Evidence-based medicine should guide clinical decision making by the multidisciplinary CI team.\\nConsideration of insurance coverage should be included during counseling as a supplement to clini-cal recommendations but should not be used as deter-rent for referral for a CI evaluation or for CI candidacy.\\nLaryngoscope 00: 2023 Zeitler et al.: Recommendations for CI Candidacy in Adults 11 15314995, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.30879, Wiley Online Library on [03/11/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 12. Implementation of an aural rehabilitation program must be encouraged as it is essential to maximize outcomes following CI.\\n13. There is no “bad” CI referral. Even if a patient does not initially qualify, the evaluation process can be educational for the patient, can provide a baseline for comparison in the future, and may result in optimiza-tion of HA technology and/or the provision of assistive listening devices.\\nCONCLUSION Untreated and undertreated hearing loss can have negative effects on quality of life. Any patient unable to beneﬁt from, or who perceives dissatisfaction with ampli-ﬁcation should be referred for a formal CI evaluation.\\nCurrently, adult CI candidacy determination involves consideration of both medical and audiological criteria.\\nAppropriate identiﬁcation of CI candidates has been shown to lead to positive outcomes in multiple objective and subjective domains. Given the success of CI technol-ogy as a treatment for disabling hearing loss, it is impera-tive to expand access for all appropriate candidates.\\nThese evidence-based recommendations outline a stan-dardized method for the identiﬁcation of potential CI can-didates, and for the pre- and post-operative evaluation of objective and subjective outcomes.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT DMZ serves on the Surgical Advisory Boards for MED-EL Corporation and Advanced Bionics Corporation, is course director and faculty for Institute for Cochlear Implant Training and is a consultant for Cochlear Corpo-ration.

Secondary cholesteatomas may develop as a result of cochlear implant surgery. Primarily acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss or cochlear implant in children. The occurrence of congenital cholesteatoma during cochlear implant surgery has never been reported before, partly because all patients are preoperatively submitted to imaging studies which can theoretically exclude the disease.\\n\\n### Case presentation\\n\\nWe have reported a rare case of congenital cholesteatoma, found during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child. The child underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months of age, before the first cochlear implant surgery, which excluded middle ear pathology. The mass was removed as an intact pearl, without visible or microscopic violation of the cholesteatoma capsule. All the areas where middle ear structures were touching the cholesteatoma were vaporized with a laser and the cochlear implant was inserted uneventfully. Further follow-up excluded residual disease.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nWe believe that primary, single stage placement of a cochlear implant (CI) with simultaneous removal of the congenital cholesteatoma can be performed safely. However, to prevent recurrence, the capsule of the cholesteatoma must not be damaged and complete laser ablation of the surface, where suspicious epithelial cells could remain, is recommended. In our opinion, cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation should be staged if these conditions are not met, and/or the disease is at a more advanced stage. It is suspected, that the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in pediatric CI candidates is much higher that in average pediatric population.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Congenital cholesteatoma, Cochlear implantation, Cochlear implant candidacy, Laser surgery\\n\\nBackground\\n----------\\n\\nCholesteatoma is an uncommon condition that has been rarely associated with cochlear implantation. Primary acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or CI in children. In case of secondary acquired cholesteatomas – they can develop as the result of cochlear implant surgery due to a breach of the posterior wall of the ear canal from drilling the posterior tympanotomy [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR1)]. The identification of congenital cholesteatoma during CI surgery is unlikely because of thorough pre-operative imaging studies, most commonly involving high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and MRI of the temporal bone, which can theoretically exclude congenital cholesteatoma. The incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in the overall population is 0.00012% and 1–3% of childhood cholesteatomas are congenital [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR3)]. Chung et al. reported that congenital cholesteatoma was identified in 2 out of 794 pediatric CI patients during their pre-operative evaluations for CI (incidence, 0.25%) [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. The authors suggest that the incidence was much higher than expected of this rare condition.\\n\\nCongenital cholesteatoma was initially described by Cawthorne and Griffith [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR5)]. In 1965, Derlacki and Clemis defined congenital cholesteatoma as an embryologic residue of epithelial tissue behind a normal tympanic membrane in the absence of a history of infection or ear surgery [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)]. Levenson added that the presence of uncomplicated acute otitis media does not exclude congenital cholesteatoma [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR7)].\\n\\nCongenital cholesteatoma usually grows slowly as a spherical-shaped keratin-filled cyst in the middle ear with a long asymptomatic period. When early detected, they are located deep to the antero-superior part of the tympanic membrane in two-thirds of the cases. The diagnosis is made at an average age of 4.5 years with a male to female ratio of 1:3. There are two types of congenital cholesteatoma, defined according to their location in the middle ear. The first is an isolated pearl located deep to the anterior part of the eardrum, which is believed to result from arrested epidermal formation at 10 weeks’ gestational age. It is suggested that these formations atrophy at approximately 33 weeks of gestational age, or are evacuated through the Eustachian tube. Failure of this mechanism results in this type of congenital cholesteatoma [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR8)]. The second type is located in the posterior part of the middle ear and causes more rapid ossicular destruction and hearing impairment. The origin of this type is thought to be amniotic fluid cells that migrate in the neonate [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR9)]. The theory of congenital cholesteatoma origin assumes that the pathology is present before birth and the diagnosis is most often made by a combination of otoscopy and HRCT. In a completely aerated tympanic cavity absent of any associated soft tissue, HRCT has a high negative predictive value when excluding cholesteatoma [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR10)]. Microsurgical excision is the accepted treatment and associated laser vaporization of contact points has been shown to limit the rate of recurrence [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR11)]. We present a case of congenital cholesteatoma found this time not during diagnostic procedure before CI, but during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child in spite of prior imaging studies.\\n\\nCase presentation\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe patient was a female child diagnosed with bilateral SNHL of genetic origin at the age of 8 months. Genetic testing identified a deletion - 35delG in gene GJB2. The patient failed the newborn hearing screen at birth with subsequent diagnostic auditory brainstem responses demonstrating bilateral, severe to profound SNHL. The child initially received hearing aids but presented significant speech delay despite conventional amplification. Referred for consideration for CI, the patient underwent thorough diagnostic testing by a multidisciplinary team as well as imaging evaluation with HRCT and MRI. HRCT of the temporal bones was performed with a standard protocol using a bone algorithm with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm and collimation of 0.3 mm.\\n\\nPreoperative 1.5 Tesla MRI (Fig.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig1)) and HRCT (Fig.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig2)) studies showed implantable inner ear spaces, present cochlear nerves, and no suggestion of additional middle ear pathology. A decision was made to implant the right ear and surgery was performed when the child reached 1 year of age. The surgery on this side was uneventful and without complications or findings of associated middle ear diseases. At the same time, the left ear was equipped with an updated hearing aid. The Integration Scale of Development was used to assess the development of hearing and speech, which is our routine protocol for children between 1 and 4 years of age. The results showed that the child achieved excellent speech and language outcomes comparable to age-appropriate normal hearing subjects. The patient was subsequently evaluated for sequential implantation of the left ear, showing unremarkable otoscopy and a normal tympanic membrane. Normal appearance of the tympanic membrane was also confirmed during otomicroscopy intraoperatively at the time of the second CI surgery. The second implantation was performed two years after the first CI surgery when the child was 3 years old. In our clinic, in cases of sequential implantation, we do not routinely re-image the temporal bones if the first examination showed no pathology. The second CI surgery was performed as per our routine protocol using a posterior tympanotomy approach to the round window and promontory. After opening the facial recess, an approximately 3-mm pearl-appearing cholesteatoma was identified between the facial ridge, incudostapedial joint, and cochleariform process (Fig.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig3)). To remove the pathology en bloc, the ossicles were disarticulated and the cholesteatoma was removed together with the incus. All tissues contacting the cholesteatoma were vaporized superficially with a diode laser at a setting of 2 W with single short pulses of 0.05 s (Fig.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig4)) delivered through a 0.6-mm fiber. In surgery for isolated cholesteatoma pearls, we routinely use a laser to minimize the risk of recurrence.

The opacification turned out to be connective tissue used for obliteration of posterior tympanotomy during the CI surgery.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n----------\\n\\nImaging before cochlear implantation is used to confirm the presence of an implantable inner ear space and intact cochlear nerve, as well as to provide important information about the surgical anatomy of the ear [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR12)]. Both MRI and HRCT can potentially diagnose a pathologic mass such as cholesteatoma in the middle ear space. HRCT has excellent sub-millimeter spatial resolution, which provides accurate delineation of even very small cholesteatomas, as long as there is a well-aerated middle ear cavity. HRCT in this setting offers high sensitivity and excellent negative predictive value [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR13)]. In our case, the conditions for evaluation of the middle ear were excellent. The middle ear was completely free of effusion (Fig.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#Fig2)), however HRCT has poor specificity because the nature of the soft tissue density cannot be differentiated.\\n\\nMRI using the conventional sequences (T1-weighted image, T2-weighted image, post-contrast T1-weighted image) provides additional information enabling distinguishment of different pathologic entities, as well as accurate diagnosis of primary and residual/recurrent cholesteatomas. Even higher diagnostic specificity is achieved with diffusion-weighted (DW) echo-planar imaging, delayed post-contrast imaging, DW-non-echo-planar imaging, and DWI-PROPELLER techniques. We used a 1.5 Tesla MRI with conventional sequences in our patient, following our routine protocol, which was focused primarily on assessing the anatomical implant feasibility in young children. However, even with conventional protocols, a pathological mass greater than 2 mm in size and surrounded by air can be identified on the T2-weighted sequence. In conventional MRI, the diagnosis of sub-millimeter anatomical structures is also possible provided that there is good signal contrast between the structure and its surroundings, as in our case. For temporal bone diagnosis in clinical practice, we use a 1.5 Tesla MRI. With the development of new models, MRI at 3 Tesla or higher is becoming more common and widely available. The main advantage is shorter acquisition time but because of artifacts specific to this anatomic region, diffusion-weighted sequence acquisition is paradoxically longer, which increases the risk of motion artifacts, especially in children, making interpretation more difficult, even for experienced radiologists [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR14)].\\n\\nExcept for paper of Chung et al., to date, there has been no literature published on the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma found prior to implantation [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. The authors found this incidence (0,25%) much higher than expected of this rare condition in general population (0.00012%). It is surprisingly common, given the absence of any cases of primarily acquired cholesteatoma in the reported group of patients, which is considerably more common in the pediatric population. Our case, as well as both reported by Chung et al. of congenital cholesteatoma patients, most likely had an inherited form of hearing loss and, as they suggested, genetic contribution to the presence of congenital cholesteatoma cannot be excluded [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. A correlation between the formation of congenital cholesteatoma and abnormal cochleovestibular anatomy and SNHL have also been reported by Propst et al. and Jackler et al. [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR15), [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR16)].\\n\\nIt has been suggested that if congenital cholesteatoma is found during diagnostic procedures for CI, the cholesteatoma should be removed and implantation delayed to the second stage [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)]. In our patient, we made the decision to remove the cholesteatoma and insert an implant in a one-stage procedure because the disease was removed as an intact pearl, without visible or microscopic violation of the cholesteatoma capsule, and the areas of contact between the cholesteatoma and middle ear structures were vaporized with a laser. The risk of recurrence was very unlikely. Such a protocol has been used in our clinic for several years in numerous ear operations, in cases of limited congenital cholesteatoma and small cholesteatoma pearls found during second-look procedures. We consider the procedure safe and do not hesitate to proceed with ossicular reconstruction in such cases. What is more, revision surgery is also not planned in such situations.\\n\\nAlthough the laser is not universally utilized in the treatment of cholesteatoma, Hamilton concludes that the appropriate use of the laser during cholesteatoma surgery facilitates significantly the complete removal of the disease and presents no extra risk to the vital structures within the temporal bone [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR11)]. Also James et al. stated that current technological advances such as laser and middle ear endoscopy contribute to better outcomes in the treatment of cholesteatoma [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR17)]. As it has been mentioned we routinely use laser during cholesteatoma surgery in our clinic.\\n\\nIt has long been recognized that a second-look procedure in cases of congenital cholesteatoma is required less often than in acquired pediatric cholesteatoma [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR18)]. James et al. suggested that when the cholesteatoma cyst is removed intact, complete eradication can be almost guaranteed, and recommended a second-look procedure when cholesteatoma extends into hidden regions such as the mastoid, or with concerns about the completeness of matrix removal [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR17)]. We also follow this strategy. In our case, the cholesteatoma did not extend into hidden spaces; it was a closed capsule and we had no concerns about incomplete removal. It should be emphasized that the decision to proceed with CI requires careful consideration on a case-by-case basis. Particularly with a larger congenital cholesteatoma, a damaged capsule, or widespread pathology, delaying CI is the most reasonable and safest option [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR4)].\\n\\nAccording to Derlacki and Clemis’ criteria the patient’s cholesteatoma met the definition of a congenital cholesteatoma - it was totally asymptomatic and behind an intact tympanic membrane [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)]. Cholesteatoma was not seen at otoscopy before the first and second surgery. Before the first surgery it was most probably so small that it was not within the limits of visibility even for CT and MRI. The cholesteatoma was not seen at otoscopy at the second surgery either because it was located medially to the long crus of the incus and the handle of the malleus. Middle ear pathology located in the posterior mesotympanum is practically invisible until it touches the tympanic membrane and can be easily overlooked.\\n\\nThe growth rate of this particular cholesteatoma had to be relatively dynamic.\\n\\nThe original size of the cholesteatoma is important. According to the first theory of origination of congenital cholesteatoma, the diameter of the epidermoid formations frequently found in human fetuses that proceed to congenital cholesteatoma if not absorbed or evacuated through the Eustachian tube, is already known. Huang et al. reviewed 49 fetuses, ranging from 12 weeks to full term. In 16 they found epidermoid formation, which was always located at the anterosuperior edge of the eardrum [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR19)]. The width and height of the epidermoid formations was 60.82 ± 5.68 microns and 45.87 ± 6.82 microns, respectively. In our case, the cholesteatoma was located in the posterior mesotympanum, and met the second theory of origination, which says that amniotic fluid cells migrate through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and then form the cholesteatoma. In this case, the cholesteatoma might have arisen from a single cell, or group of cells, also microns in diameter.\\n\\nAssuming a linear growth for congenital cholesteatoma, James et al. calculated that closed cholesteatoma cysts enlarge by approximately 1 mm in diameter per year, based on CT measurements ([[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR20)] James). We can assume in our case that the growth was linear because it was a closed round capsule; therefore, in the first year of life, theoretically, the cholesteatoma would have been approximately 1 mm in diameter, enlarging to approximately 3 mm in diameter at 3 years of age. A 1-mm pearl would be visible by imaging studies and the negative predictive value of CT in such a case is excellent [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR6)].\\n\\nThe explanation for the lack of identification of the cholesteatoma on the initial HRCT is that the pathology was too small to be visualized. The most likely it was a very small sub-millimeter “sleeper” congenital cholesteatoma with no growth between birth and the first year, but with subsequent rapid growth between 1 and 3 years of life.\\n\\nBilateral cochlear implantation in young children is increasingly common in clinical practice. Among the benefits of bilateral cochlear implantation is the restoration of some of the advantages of binaural hearing such as localization, improved listening in noise, directional hearing, binaural summation, and squelch. Typically, young hearing-impaired children are being provided with two implants either at the same time (simultaneous implantation) or at different times in early childhood as in our case (sequential implantation) [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/#CR21)]. Our local public funding policy enables children to receive initially unilateral cochlear implant due to economic limitations. In our clinic, excluding the post meningitis deafness, when bilateral implants are put simultaneously, the CI candidates are implanted unilaterally as quickly as possible, starting from the age of 12 months. Only when we are able to provide all candidates with one implant and meet the economic limitations, do we consider giving another implant to prior pediatric CI users.\\n\\nExamining the findings in this patient, the obvious question arises whether to perform another imaging study which could preclude the existing, newly formed cholesteatoma before the subsequent CI surgery, and how much time should elapse between the first and second implantation, to perform such a study most effectively?\\n\\nWe believe that the rarity of our particular case does not justify the additional cost and burden of repeating the standard HRCT and/or MRI in so young children. Also, our case presented with limited pathology that was controlled by a single-stage procedure. We emphasize the importance of continued follow-up and advise considering staging in either known disease or more extensive disease as a reasonable and safe option.\\n\\nConclusions\\n-----------\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of an incidental finding of congenital cholesteatoma during CI surgery despite presurgical imaging studies. Primary excision en bloc with the removal of associated ossicular elements and laser surface ablation is the recommended treatment for limited congenital cholesteatoma. Primary placement of an implant during cholesteatoma removal is warranted as long as there is insignificant risk of recurrence, provided that no damage of the capsule has occurred and complete and safe surface contact of epithelial laser ablation was observed. There should be a low threshold for staging the implant if any of these conditions are not met, and/or the disease is found to be more extensive. Follow-up should include regular microscopic ear examination and HRCT.\\n\\nThere is suspicion that the incidence of congenital cholesteatoma in pediatric CI candidates is much higher than in normal pediatric population (4).\\n\\n### Consent\\n\\nThe written consent was obtained from the patient’s parents to publish the details of their child’s case.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n----------------\\n\\nWe thank language editor Kumiko Shimogami from Edanz Group Global Ltd who has made significant revision of the manuscript.

Secondary cholesteatomas may develop as a result of cochlear implant surgery. Primarily acquired cholesteatoma is not typically associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss or cochlear implant in children. The occurrence of congenital cholesteatoma during cochlear implant surgery has never been reported before, partly because all patients are preoperatively submitted to imaging studies which can theoretically exclude the disease.\\n\\n### Case presentation\\n\\nWe have reported a rare case of congenital cholesteatoma, found during sequential second side cochlear implantation in a 3-year-old child.

      "# Review of Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria Including Post-Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Patients\n",
      "\n",
      "## Problem Statement\n",
      "\n",
      "Collect comprehensive, up-to-date clinical guidelines and studies on cochlear implant (CI) candidacy with emphasis on patients who have undergone middle ear surgeries such as tympanoplasties or have a history of cholesteatoma. Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Research Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\n",
      "\n",
      "- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- CI candidacy should be considered on an ear-specific basis rather than using the better ear as the reference point, with emphasis on speech recognition scores (≤ 50% on CNC word test in the ear to be implanted) and aided speech recognition testing (e.g., AzBio sentences in noise).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hearing preservation is possible and residual low-frequency hearing should not be a contraindication; electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) should be considered in these cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A multidisciplinary evaluation involving audiologists, CI surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and support systems is critical for tailored candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Factors such as duration of deafness, etiology, amplification use, cognitive status, motivation, and social support impact outcomes and should be considered in candidacy assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Imaging (high-resolution CT and MRI) is used to assess cochlear and middle ear anatomy prior to implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis is recommended for all adult CI candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Off-label implants beyond FDA labeling are common and should be considered when clinical evidence supports benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Candidacy in Patients with Prior Tympanoplasty or Middle Ear Pathology\n",
      "\n",
      "- Middle ear pathology and prior surgeries (e.g., tympanoplasty) are not absolute contraindications but may affect timing and ear selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Middle ear must be free of active infection and dry before implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Integrity of the cochlear lumen and cochlear nerve is essential, assessed by imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Disruptions of the ossicular chain and conductive components need to be differentiated from sensorineural losses; mixed losses can affect candidacy and hearing aid benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma\n",
      "\n",
      "- Patients with a history of cholesteatoma require careful assessment before CI.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Active, infected, or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma must be ruled out; the ear should be dry with no evidence of active disease prior to implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The cochlear lumen and nerve must be intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Imaging (HRCT and MRI) is essential for preoperative evaluation and exclusion of recurrent disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously if the cholesteatoma is limited and the capsule is intact, with use of laser vaporization to reduce recurrence risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In cases where the cholesteatoma is extensive, capsule integrity is lost, or recurrence risk is high, staging the procedure (removal first, implant later) is recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A reported case describes discovery of congenital cholesteatoma found incidentally during sequential cochlear implantation in a child despite prior imaging, highlighting the possibility of occult disease in this population.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examination, is important to detect residual or recurrent disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness. For patients with prior middle ear surgeries like tympanoplasty and history of cholesteatoma, candidacy assessment requires careful multidisciplinary evaluation with attention to middle ear status. The ear should be free of infection and active disease, with confirmed cochlear and nerve integrity. Ossicular chain interruptions and conductive hearing loss components should be identified and differentiated as they influence candidacy decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is feasible if disease is eradicated and no residual pathology remains. Simultaneous cochlear implantation and cholesteatoma removal can be performed safely when the disease is limited and the cholesteatoma capsule intact with laser ablation to reduce recurrence.

Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\\n\\n## Research Findings\\n\\n### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\\n\\n- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\\n\\n- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\\n\\n- CI candidacy should be considered on an ear-specific basis rather than using the better ear as the reference point, with emphasis on speech recognition scores (≤ 50% on CNC word test in the ear to be implanted) and aided speech recognition testing (e.g., AzBio sentences in noise).\\n\\n- Hearing preservation is possible and residual low-frequency hearing should not be a contraindication; electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) should be considered in these cases.\\n\\n- A multidisciplinary evaluation involving audiologists, CI surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and support systems is critical for tailored candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\\n\\n- Factors such as duration of deafness, etiology, amplification use, cognitive status, motivation, and social support impact outcomes and should be considered in candidacy assessment.\\n\\n- Imaging (high-resolution CT and MRI) is used to assess cochlear and middle ear anatomy prior to implantation.\\n\\n- Vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis is recommended for all adult CI candidates.\\n\\n- Off-label implants beyond FDA labeling are common and should be considered when clinical evidence supports benefit.\\n\\n### Candidacy in Patients with Prior Tympanoplasty or Middle Ear Pathology\\n\\n- Middle ear pathology and prior surgeries (e.g., tympanoplasty) are not absolute contraindications but may affect timing and ear selection.\\n\\n- Middle ear must be free of active infection and dry before implantation.\\n\\n- Integrity of the cochlear lumen and cochlear nerve is essential, assessed by imaging.\\n\\n- Disruptions of the ossicular chain and conductive components need to be differentiated from sensorineural losses; mixed losses can affect candidacy and hearing aid benefit.\\n\\n### Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma\\n\\n- Patients with a history of cholesteatoma require careful assessment before CI.\\n\\n- Active, infected, or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma must be ruled out; the ear should be dry with no evidence of active disease prior to implantation.\\n\\n- The cochlear lumen and nerve must be intact.\\n\\n- Imaging (HRCT and MRI) is essential for preoperative evaluation and exclusion of recurrent disease.\\n\\n- Cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously if the cholesteatoma is limited and the capsule is intact, with use of laser vaporization to reduce recurrence risk.\\n\\n- In cases where the cholesteatoma is extensive, capsule integrity is lost, or recurrence risk is high, staging the procedure (removal first, implant later) is recommended.\\n\\n- A reported case describes discovery of congenital cholesteatoma found incidentally during sequential cochlear implantation in a child despite prior imaging, highlighting the possibility of occult disease in this population.\\n\\n- Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examination, is important to detect residual or recurrent disease.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness. For patients with prior middle ear surgeries like tympanoplasty and history of cholesteatoma, candidacy assessment requires careful multidisciplinary evaluation with attention to middle ear status. The ear should be free of infection and active disease, with confirmed cochlear and nerve integrity. Ossicular chain interruptions and conductive hearing loss components should be identified and differentiated as they influence candidacy decisions.\\n\\nIn cases of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is feasible if disease is eradicated and no residual pathology remains. Simultaneous cochlear implantation and cholesteatoma removal can be performed safely when the disease is limited and the cholesteatoma capsule intact with laser ablation to reduce recurrence. Otherwise, staged surgery is warranted. Thorough imaging preoperatively and close postoperative follow-up are essential.\\n\\nThese evidence-based criteria and clinical considerations should guide candidacy evaluations and surgical planning in this complex patient subset to optimize outcomes.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [American Cochlear Implant Alliance Task Force: Recommendations for Determining Cochlear Implant Candidacy in Adults (Laryngoscope, 2023)](https://www.audiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Laryngoscope-2023-Zeitler-American-Cochlear-Implant-Alliance-Task-Force-Recommendations-for-Determining-Cochlear.pdf)\\n\\n- [Cochlear implant and congenital cholesteatoma (Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/)\\n\\n- [Management of Cholesteatoma - Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024 Article)](https://www.oto.theclinics.com/article/S0030-6665(24)00111-7/fulltext)\\n\\n- [Clinical Practice Guideline: Cochlear Implants - American Speech-Language-Hearing Association](https://www.audiology.org/practice-guideline/clinical-practice-guideline-cochlear-implants/)\\n\\n- [Medicare Expands Cochlear Implant Candidacy Guidelines](https://neurotucson.com/medicare-expands-cochlear-implant-candidacy-guidelines/)\\n\\n## Images\\n\\n![Cochlear Implant: Audiogram showing hearing thresholds](https://entmanitoba.com/sites/default/files/styles/half_width/public/2023-05/Picture3.png?itok=SlspHvBu)\\n\\n![Graphic representing cochlear implant candidacy criteria for post-tympanoplasty cholesteatoma patients](https://assets.cochlear.com/api/public/content/1597f74884b249aeac497056925020fb?v=e6bcfa12)\\n</finding>\\n\\n# Current Task\\n\\n## Title\\n\\nInvestigate Surgical Considerations and Risks for Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nCompile information on surgical techniques and challenges associated with cochlear implantation in ears previously operated for cholesteatoma and ossicular damage.

The fitting of a cochlear implant is an innovative technique that totally changed therapeutic strategy of both congenital and acquired sensorineural hearing loss. With this device, as long as the cochlear nerve has kept its integrity, patients with acquired hearing loss have a considerable chance of improving or restoring verbal communication, and infants with congenital hearing loss subsequently may show very good linguistic development. Even though profound bilateral hearing loss is complicated with some pathology, basic requirement for the candidate of cochlear implantation stays the same.\\n\\n### 12.1 Indications\\n\\n### General Indications for Cochlear Implantation\\n\\nProfound (or total) bilateral hearing loss with little or insufficient benefits from conventional hearing aids in the presence of the following:\\n\\n*   Good health condition.\\n\\n*   Motivation to hear (adults).\\n\\n*   Support from the family (children).\\n\\nIn same particular case of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is required either in the same stage, or as a second-stage procedure to restore hearing. In contrast to cochlear implantation in normal middle ear in which the electrode array is inserted through posterior tympanotomy, the surgeon should take risk of recurrent disease into consideration. Canal wall down and radical cavities after cholesteatoma surgery force surgeon to place the lead of electrode array close to the surface if the cavity is maintained. Therefore, different strategy to avoid complications needs to be applied.\\n\\n### Indications of Cochlear Implantation with Subtotal Petrosectomy in Cholesteatoma Surgery\\n\\nProfound (or total) bilateral hearing loss with little or insufficient benefits from conventional hearing aids in the presence of the following:\\n\\n*   Middle ear cholesteatoma.\\n\\n*   Radical or canal wall down cavity with/without inflammation.\\n\\n*   Petrous bone cholesteatoma with preserved cochlea and cochlear nerve.\\n\\nRecurrence of cholesteatoma in the implanted ear or shallow placement of electrode array in the open cavity gives risks of extrusion of the cochlear implant. If the ear gets infection, the risks of breakdown of the retroauricular skin covering the internal unit and even meningitis arise. Combination of cochlear implantation with subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration significantly reduce such danger, since the procedure separates the cavity from external environment and eliminates possibility of recurrent disease. In some cases of petrous bone cholesteatoma, cholesteatoma is removed with translabyrinthine approach. The labyrinthectomy leads to postoperative ossification and/or fibrosis of the cochlea, making cochlear implantation in future impossible. If the surgeon preserves the cochlea, an electrode array may be inserted in the same stage depending on its necessity.\\n\\nAn electrode is inserted into the scala tympani of the cochlea through either the round window or a cochleostomy created in the promontory. We prefer to use round window approach whenever possible, just because it is more natural anatomically. However, in case of cholesteatoma, the round window is often obliterated with ossification, and need of drilling on the area of the round window is frequently encountered. In addition, the basal turn of the cochlea may be ossified due to inflammatory process, requiring further drilling of the cochlea. To create a cochleostomy in appropriate position in such complicated situations, full anatomical knowledge of the middle ear and inner ear is required.\\n\\nThe surgeon should recognize that insertion of the electrode is just the start of cochlear implantation. Cochlear implantation is a system of therapy that comprises not only surgery but also postoperative fitting and rehabilitation that require a range of other professional skills and teamworking with audiologists, speech therapists, and electrophysiologists. Currently, devices produced by four companies are available in the market. Each device has its own advantages over others, but the indication for any particular patient is not known fully, especially cases with cholesteatoma. Experience with this new device is accumulating, and further studies are required.\\n\\n### 12.2 Contraindications\\n\\nRelative contraindications arise in the presence of active purulent infection with multiresistant microorganisms or tuberculosis. The procedure can be staged when the risk of postoperative infection is considered to be high. In such cases, subtotal petrosectomy with total eradication of the infection under antibiotic coverage is performed in the first stage. After 3 to 6 months when there is no sign of infection, the obliterated cavity is reopened to perform cochlear implantation. The same strategy is applied to cholesteatoma when the surgeon is suspicious of complete removal.\\n\\nThe required surgical steps are shown in cases described below. In contrast to other middle ear procedures, the surgery requires hair shaving and usually facial nerve monitoring.\\n\\n### _Case 12.1 (Right Ear): Cochlear Implantation in Acquired Cholesteatoma_\\n\\nSee ![Image 1: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.1](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f001), ![Image 2: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.2](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f002), ![Image 3: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.3](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f003), ![Image 4: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.4](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f004), ![Image 5: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.5](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f005), ![Image 6: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.6](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f006), ![Image 7: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.7](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f007), ![Image 8: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.8](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f008), ![Image 9: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.9](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f009), ![Image 10: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.10](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f010), ![Image 11: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.11](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f011), ![Image 12: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.12](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f012), ![Image 13: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.13](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f013), ![Image 14: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.14](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f014), ![Image 15: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.15](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f015), ![Image 16: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.16](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f016), ![Image 17: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.17](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f017), ![Image 18: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.18](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f018), ![Image 19: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.19](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f019), ![Image 20: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.20](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f020), ![Image 21: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.21](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f021), ![Image 22: ▶](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/25b6.svg)[Fig. 12.22](https://entokey.com/12-cochlear-implantation-in-cholesteatoma-surgery/#c012_f022).\\n\\n![Image 23](https://i0.wp.com/entokey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-1055-b-006-160283_c012_f001.jpg?w=960)\\n\\n**Fig. 12.1** A case of cholesteatoma with profound hearing loss in both ears.

As the aeration of the middle ear is associated with hearing outcome, we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing after the BOT may be better compared to CWU and CWD without obliteration.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nThis is a retrospective cohort study on all adult patients who underwent the BOT, CWU without obliteration or CWD without obliteration for primary or revision cholesteatoma between January 2003 and March 2019 with audiological follow-up at our institution. Pre-operative, short-term post-operative and long-term post-operative hearing tests were analyzed and potential factors influencing post-operative hearing were assessed.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\n626 ears were included. We found no significant differences between the short-term and long-term post-operative audiometry. The pre-operative air–bone gap (ABG) was the factor with the largest effect size on change in air–bone gap (ABG) between pre- and post-operative. When stratifying for this factor along with the type of ossicular chain reconstruction to account for differences at baseline, no significant differences in post-operative ABG were found between BOT and non-obliteration CWU and CWD.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn this large retrospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and the non-obliteration CWU and CWD. A solid comparison of hearing between groups remains very challenging as hearing outcome seems to be dependent on many different factors. Hearing outcome seems to be no additional argument to choose for BOT over non-obliteration surgery.\\n\\n### Supplementary Information\\n\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00405-022-07367-x.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Cholesteatoma, Bony obliteration tympanoplasty, Canal wall up, Canal wall downhearing, Udiological results BOT, CWU, CWD\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nAlthough the primary goal of cholesteatoma surgery is complete disease removal with the lowest possible recurrent cholesteatoma rates, optimal post-operative hearing is an important secondary goal and paramount to the patient involved [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR1)]. It is hard to offer reliable individual patient counseling on post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery as post-operative hearing is not only dependent on factors such as the ossicular chain status, ossicular chain reconstruction [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR2)–[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR4)] and extension of cholesteatoma [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR5)], but it is also suggested that factors as the aeration of the middle ear [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR6)–[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR8)] are associated with the hearing outcome.\\n\\nObliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space is becoming a more and more established technique in cholesteatoma surgery with promising outcome concerning recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)]. It is stated that mastoid obliteration causes a reduction in mucosal surface for gas exchange and that it, therefore, can improve the gas pressure balance in the middle ear resulting in slower gas absorption and slower pressure changes [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR10)] and that mastoid obliteration facilitates better aeration of the middle ear [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR11)]. Since post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery is influenced, among other things, by aeration of the middle ear, we hypothesize that the hearing results after mastoid obliteration in cholesteatoma surgery may be better compared to non-obliterative techniques. While many previous researchers have reported on post-operative hearing after cholesteatoma surgery, there is no study that compares mastoid obliteration to non-obliterative techniques with respect to post-operative hearing.\\n\\nIn our institution, the canal wall up with mastoid obliteration (bony obliteration tympanoplasty, BOT) was introduced in 2013 and gradually replaced the canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) approach without mastoid obliteration. As these different surgical techniques were performed by the same surgeons in the same institution, it is interesting to compare the audiological results of these approaches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the audiological results after BOT to those after CWU and CWD without mastoid obliteration in our cohort and to compare our results with literature.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n---------------------\\n\\n### Patients\\n\\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted at the department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of the Erasmus Medical Center (tertiary referral center) with approval of the medical research ethical committee. All adult patients (≥ 18 years) who underwent the BOT, CWU without mastoid obliteration or CWD without mastoid obliteration for primary or recurrent cholesteatoma between January 2003 and March 2019 were included. Cases without audiological follow-up or with other surgical techniques than mentioned above (i.e., partial mastoid obliteration) were excluded. As the BOT was introduced in 2013 in our institution, all included cases before this introduction consist of CWU and CWD without obliteration. As the BOT was gradually introduced, the included cases from the year 2013 onwards consist of both BOT and the non-obliteration approaches.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nPatient demographics, surgical technique, primary versus revision surgery, audiological results (as described below), extension of cholesteatoma according to the STAMCO classification [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR12)], ossicular chain status before and after cholesteatoma removal, type of middle ear reconstruction and most recent follow-up date were collected from electronic patient records. The surgical technique was classified as either (1) BOT (2) CWU without obliteration or (3) CWD without obliteration. The ossicular chain status before and after surgery was classified as (1) intact chain, (2) incus absent with intact stapes, (3) stapes superstructure absent with or without intact incus, or (4) footplate fixation. The type of middle ear reconstruction was classified as (1) no reconstruction due to intact chain, (2) no reconstruction due to unfavorable middle ear aspects, (3) incus interposition, (4) partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), (5) tympanic membrane to stapes (type III tympanoplasty), (6) total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), or (7) tympanic membrane directly to footplate (type IV tympanoplasty).\\n\\n### Surgical technique\\n\\nThe BOT, CWU and CWD were performed under general anesthesia. The BOT was performed as described by Offeciers [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR13)] and van Dinther et al. [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR14), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR15)]. Two grams of cefazolin was administrated intravenously prior to surgery and if necessary repeated after 4 h. After a wide retro-auricular incision, cortical bone chips and cortical bone dust were harvested and stored in a rifamycin solution (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA. Rifadin® 600 mg powder for infusion with 10 mL solvent for solution and 20 mL 0.9% sodium chloride). A cortical mastoidectomy was performed leaving the posterior canal wall intact, followed by a wide posterior tympanotomy and epitympanotomy. If still present, the malleus head and incus were removed. After removal of all cholesteatoma and accessible cell tracts, bone chips were used to separate the epitympanum and mastoid from the middle ear. The cavity was filled with autologous bone pate and/or bioactive glass granules S53P4 (Bonealive®, Bonalive Biomaterials Ltd., Turku, Finland). If possible an ossicular chain reconstruction was performed using either autologous material (incus interposition or cartilage graft) or a titanium prosthesis. The tympanic membrane was reconstructed using cartilage or temporal fascia. Finally, the ear canal was packed with a gauze with hydrocortisone/oxytetracycline/polymixin B for at least 1 week. In CWU and CWD without mastoid obliteration, usually no antibiotics were administrated prior to surgery. A cortical mastoidectomy was performed with preservation of the posterior canal wall for CWU surgery and removal of the posterior canal wall in cases of CWD surgery. When necessary in CWU surgery, the scutum was reconstructed with bone chips or cartilage. If possible an ossicular chain reconstruction was performed and the tympanic membrane was reconstructed with cartilage or temporal fascia. As with the BOT, the ear canal or mastoid bowl was packed with a gauze with hydrocortisone/oxytetracycline/polymixin B for at least 1 week.\\n\\n### Audiological evaluation\\n\\nFor each case, the pure tone averages (PTA) calculated over 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz for the air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) threshold were obtained from the electronic patient records from the pre-operative and short-term post-operative hearing test (≥ 6 weeks post-surgery) and if available from the long-term post-operative hearing test (≥ 12 months post-surgery). All thresholds were measured according to the shortened ascending method based on ISO standard 8253–1, which means that thresholds were defined by the intensity level at which the tone was heard in 2 out of 3 ascents. All testing was performed in a sound-attenuated booth at our outpatient department, on clinical audiometers (Decos audiology workstation), calibrated according to international standards. Threshold levels beyond the maximum stimulus level of the audiometer were registered as 120 dB HL.\\n\\n### Statistical analyses\\n\\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). Because of not normally distributed data, the Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to assess for significant differences between the three surgical techniques. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to calculate the effect size of different variables on change in ABG based on the Z-score of this test. An effect size between 0.10 and 0.30 was indicated as a small effect size, 0.30–0.50 as a medium effect size, and > 0.50 as a large effect size [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR16)]. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to assess for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\n### Subgroup analyses\\n\\nTo address the heterogenicity between different groups, variables with a relatively large effect size or clinical relevance on change in ABG were determined. We stratified for these variables in a subgroup analyses for differences in audiological outcome between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques. As the ossicular chain is per definition not intact after the BOT (i.e., the malleus head and incus are removed), cases in the CWU and CWD group with an intact chain after cholesteatoma removal were excluded for this subgroup analyses, facilitating the fairest possible comparison between the surgical techniques.\\n\\nResults\\n-------\\n\\nBetween January 2003 and March 2019, 626 ears of 558 patients underwent a BOT, CWU without obliteration or CWD without obliteration for cholesteatoma with audiological follow-up at our institution. Short-term audiometry was available for all 626 patients and long-term audiometry was available for 560 patients. The median time from surgery to hearing test was 14 weeks (IQR 11–20 weeks) for the short-term audiometry and 20 months (IQR 12–51 months) for the long-term audiometry. One-hundred and ninety-eight (31.6%) cases consisted of BOT, 275 (43.9%) consisted of CWU without obliteration and 153 (24.5%) consisted of CWD without obliteration. In the BOT group 73 cases (36.9%) consisted of primary surgery and 125 (63.1%) revision surgery; in the CWU without obliteration group these numbers were 148 (53.8%) and 127 (46.2%), respectively, and in the CWD without obliteration group, these numbers were 97 (63.4%) and 56 (36.6%), respectively.

There were no clinically relevant differences in post-operative AC threshold, BC threshold and ABG between the short- and long-term audiometry. Due to a larger number of cases who underwent short-term audiometry, further analyses were performed using the short-term audiometry. For pre- and post-operative hearing, there was a significant difference in AC threshold, BC threshold level and ABG between the surgical techniques (_P_ = 0.000, _P_ = 0.000 and _P_ = 0.006, respectively, for pre-operative hearing and _P_ = 0.000, _P_ = 0.000 and _P_ = 0.000, respectively, for post-operative hearing). There were no differences in change of AC threshold, BC threshold and ABG between the different groups.

A positive effect size implicates relatively more patients with an improvement of ABG, whereas a negative effect size implicates relatively more patients with deterioration of ABG. The pre-operative ABG seems to have a relatively large effect size on the change in ABG and was included in the subgroup analyses for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques (Table [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab4)). Because of clinical relevance, we also included the ossicular chain reconstruction in these analyses; cases with an intact ossicular chain after cholesteatoma removal were excluded for this subgroup analyses. For all variables, no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques were found. There were some small non-significant differences of only a few decibels per group, but they are considered clinically irrelevant.\\n\\n#### Table 4.\\n\\nSubgroup analysis for differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques\\n\\n|  |  | BOT |  | CWU and CWD without obliteration |  | _P_ |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| _N_ (%) | Median post-operative ABG in dB HL (IQR) | _N_ (%) | Median post-operative ABG in dB HL (IQR) |\\n| Pre-operative ABG < 20 dB | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 5 | 22.5 (16.3–26.9) | 7 | 20.0 (15.0–36.3) | 0.870 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 7 | 13.8 (8.8–15.0) | 13 | 12.5 (7.5–16.9) | 0.781 |\\n|  | PORP | 30 | 16.3 (9.7–21.6) | 25 | 15.0 (12.5–21.3) | 0.722 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 22 | 18.8 (13.4–26.3) | 91 | 17.5 (11.3–22.5) | 0.093 |\\n|  | TORP | 7 | 26.3 (15.0–33.8) | 2 | 19.4 (16.3–NA) | 0.769 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 0 | NA | 11 | 17.5 (12.5–27.5) | NA |\\n|  | Total | 71 | 17.5 (12.5–22.5) | 149 | 16.3 (11.3–22.5) | 0.471 |\\n| Pre-operative ABG 20–40 dB HL | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 23 | 31.3 (23.8–35.0) | 22 | 28.1 (20.0–33.4) | 0.351 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 3 | 18.8 (3.8–NA) | 3 | 8.8 (6.3–NA) | 0.827 |\\n|  | PORP | 27 | 21.3 (16.3–31.3) | 22 | 18.1 (13.4–26.6) | 0.344 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 22 | 22.5 (19.4–34.7) | 102 | 25.0 (17.5–32.5) | 0.786 |\\n|  | TORP | 23 | 23.8 (17.5–32.5) | 11 | 20.0 (11.3–23.8) | 0.090 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 1 | 30.0 | 33 | 28.8 (23.8–36.9) | 0.878 |\\n|  | Total | 99 | 23.8 (17.5–33.1) | 193 | 25.0 (17.5–32.5) | 0.975 |\\n| Pre-operative ABG ≥ 40 dB HL | No reconstruction, chain not intact | 5 | 35.0 (34.4–41.3) | 6 | 37.5 (29.7–42.8) | 1.000 |\\n|  | Incus interposition | 1 | 31.3 | 0 | NA | NA |\\n|  | PORP | 4 | 32.5 (15.0–35.0) | 6 | 30.0 (29.5–35.0) | 0.819 |\\n|  | TM to stapes (type III) | 7 | 25.0 (20.0–37.5) | 12 | 33.1 (21.3–35.9) | 1.000 |\\n|  | TORP | 5 | 20.0 (17.8–24.5) | 7 | 21.3 (18.8–25.0) | 0.515 |\\n|  | TM directly to footplate | 0 | NA | 8 | 36.9 (23.8–42.2) | NA |\\n|  | Total | 22 | 30.6 (20.0–35.0) | 39 | 30.0 (23.8–38.8) | 0.498 |\\n| Missing |  | 6 |  | 10 |  |  |\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/table/Tab4/)\\n\\n_BOT_ bony obliteration tympanoplasty, _CWU_ canal wall up, _ABG_ air–bone gap, _PORP_ partial ossicular replacement prosthesis, _TM_ tympanic membrane, _TORP_ total ossicular replacement prosthesis\\n\\nCases with intact ossicular chain were excluded\\n\\nDiscussion\\n----------\\n\\nIn this study, we evaluated and compared the hearing outcome after the BOT versus the non-obliteration CWU and CWD in a large patient cohort in our tertiary referral center. As the aeration of the middle ear is associated with hearing outcome [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR7)], we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing after the BOT may be better compared to the non-obliteration CWU and CWD technique. However, we found no significant differences in hearing outcome between those surgical techniques, but comparison of the different groups is challenging as post-operative hearing is influenced by many factors.\\n\\nSince the introduction of mastoid obliteration in canal wall down (CWD) cholesteatoma surgery with canal wall reconstruction by Mercke in 1987 [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR17)], many have reported on their outcomes after mastoid obliteration using different surgical approaches (CWU and CWD) and obliteration materials [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)]. With a mean recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rate of 4.6% and 5.4%, respectively [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)], the surgical outcome of obliterative techniques are overall better compared to the non-obliteration CWU and CWD in which recurrence rates (recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rate combined) of 4–70% are reported [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR18)]. While the recurrent and residual rates after obliteration and non-obliteration cholesteatoma surgery are well described in literature, the audiological results remain underexposed as there are no comparative studies on hearing results after BOT verus CWU and CWD without obliteration. Several studies reported on hearing results after BOT or CWU/CWD without obliteration alone, in which the audiological success rate ranges from 19 to 75% (Table [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab5)). The most common used success criterion in these studies is the percentage of cases with a post-operative ABG ≤ 20 dB, which was achieved in 19%–55.9% in the mastoid obliteration studies and 51.8–73% in the CWU/CWD without obliteration studies. In our cohort, a post-operative ABG ≤ 20 dB was achieved in 44.4% after the BOT and in 49.5% after CWU/CWD without obliteration. However, it is difficult if not impossible to systematically compare the hearing outcome of these studies as the post-operative hearing is dependent on many factors which are not commonly reported on, such as the ossicular chain status, ossicular chain reconstruction, pre-operative hearing, extension of cholesteatoma and middle ear aeration. A difference in prevalence of these factors may have caused the broad spread of results between these studies.\\n\\n### Table 5.\\n\\nComparison of hearing outcome with literature\\n\\n| Study | Year | Population | No. of cases | Surgical technique | Success criterion | % Success | % Success in the present study with this criterion for BOT | % Success in the present study with this criterion for non-obliteration CWU/CWD |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| Lee et al.

Importantly, no conclusions can be drawn when analyzing the total group of patients due to the significant heterogenicity in patient characteristics between the treatment groups at baseline. As seen in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1), factors with a positive effect on improvement of hearing were more frequently seen in the CWU without obliteration group (smaller pre-operative ABG, smaller cholesteatoma according to the STAM classification). We found that the pre-operative ABG has a relatively large effect size on change in ABG between pre- and post-operative (supplemental Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1)). When stratifying for this factor along with the ossicular chain reconstruction due to clinical relevance to account for difference at baseline (Table [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab4)), no significant differences in post-operative ABG were found between BOT and non-obliteration CWU and CWD. This was against our expectations, as we hypothesized that the post-operative hearing results after mastoid obliteration may be better compared to non-obliteration techniques. One of the rationales behind mastoid obliteration is that reducing the mucosal surface for gas exchange can result in slower gas absorption and slower pressure changes, resulting in less pathologic abnormalities of the middle ear [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR10)]. While it is generally assumed that this results in an improved tympanic cavity aeration and thus in better hearing, the scientific evidence on this is weak and our data does not support this theory. It is stated that mastoid obliteration facilitates aeration of the middle ear [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR11), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR19)], but these studies do not compare the aeration of obliteration surgery with the aeration of non-obliteration surgery. The only comparative study on this subject was performed by Vartiainen et al. in 1987 [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR20)], in which an adhesive tympanic membrane was seen in 12% after both CWU with obliteration and CWU without obliteration. However, in this study the epitympanic space was not obliterated, which may have caused an underestimation of the potentially positive effect of obliteration on middle ear aeration as it is suggested that the epitympanum plays an important role in the gas exchange due to highly vascularized mucosa compared to the pro-, meso- and hypotympanum [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR21)]. Due to the retrospective design of the present study, no data on pre- and post-operative middle ear aeration were available. Further research is required to prospectively assess the role of mastoid and epitympanic obliteration on middle ear aeration.\\n\\nOther explanations for the fact that we observed no differences in hearing outcome between the BOT and non-obliteration techniques may be sought in the limitations of this study. Limitations include the retrospective design, the possible bias and confounding factors and the lack of power due to relatively low patient numbers after stratification. The motives to perform a CWU or CWD without obliteration over a BOT were not always clear due to the retrospective design of the study. It is plausible that, especially in the first period after the introduction of the BOT in our institution, there has been positive selection bias for large cholesteatoma due to an adaption period for the surgeons in changing their surgical approach. Even today the CWU without obliteration is still sometimes performed at our institution in some cases of limited, primary or small cholesteatoma, while the BOT is performed in more extensive cases in which before a CWD approach would have been performed, causing a possible indication bias. As shown in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1) for example, the CWU without obliteration group consisted of more small cholesteatoma (STAM 1), less large cholesteatoma (STAM 3) and less cases with an absent stapes compared to the BOT group; all cases which were associated with a smaller post-operative ABG (Supplemental Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#Tab1)). We tried to minimalize the effect of this bias on our outcome by performing subgroup analyses in which we stratified for the variables with a relatively large effect size on post-operative hearing. While we believe that this was the best possible statistical method on this retrospective data, it is conceivable that the cases in the BOT group consisted of more severe or pathologic cholesteatoma compared to the non-obliteration group and that we were not able to facilitate a fair comparison between the surgical techniques. This may have resulted in worse hearing outcome in the BOT group. Furthermore, there are still several possible confounding factors which we were not able to correct for such as the infection rate, antibiotics administration, tobacco use and experience of the surgeon. The infection rate is difficult to measure, but can potentially affect the stabilization of the middle ear and thus affect hearing. Also, the experience and skill of the surgeon may affect the hearing results, but data are lacking as skill is a subjective concept. Upcoming research on audiological results after cholesteatoma surgery should therefore focus on identifying as much as possible factors which influence post-operative hearing. Finally, as we found no differences in post-operative hearing between the BOT and CWU and CWD without obliteration, we prefer the BOT to non-obliteration surgery as the recurrent and residual rates are significantly lower and the hygienic results are excellent after the former technique [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9519705/#CR9)].\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn this large retrospective cohort study, we found no significant differences in post-operative ABG between the BOT and the non-obliteration CWU and CWD. A solid comparison of hearing between groups remains very challenging as hearing outcome seems to be dependent on many different factors. Hearing outcome seems to be no additional argument to choose for BOT over non-obliteration surgery.\\n\\nSupplementary Information\\n-------------------------\\n\\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\\n\\n[Supplementary file1 (DOCX 14 KB)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/9519705/bin/405_2022_7367_MOESM1_ESM.docx) (14.1KB, docx) \\n\\nFunding\\n-------\\n\\nNone were declared.\\n\\nDeclarations\\n------------\\n\\n### Conflict of interest\\n\\nNone were declared.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n---------\\n\\n**Publisher's Note**\\n\\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n*   1.Quaranta N, Iannuzzi L, Petrone P, D'Elia A, Quaranta A.

Thirty-four pediatric cases and 26 adult cases are described in the literature. Cholesteatoma has a prevalence of 0.54% in pediatric CIs, and 1.79% in adult CIs (case series and literature). Adult cases were diagnosed significantly later compared to pediatric cases (Mann–Whitney test, _p_ = 0.0460). Three pediatric cholesteatomas were treated with conservative surgery and preservation of the CI; they all developed recurrent disease. The remaining pediatric cases underwent subtotal petrosectomy with simultaneous CI explantation and staged reimplantation. Only one case recurred. The adult cases underwent simultaneous subtotal petrosectomy, explantation, and reimplantation. Similarly, 33.3% of cases treated with conservative/reconstructive surgery in the literature required revision surgery or conversion to subtotal petrosectomy against 6.2% of subtotal petrosectomies in the literature.\\n\\n### Conclusions\\n\\nCholesteatoma after CI is a rare and late-onset complication of CIs. It is more prevalent in the adult CI population, although it affects children significantly earlier. The treatment of choice is subtotal petrosectomy and CI explantation with simultaneous or staged reimplantation.\\n\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y) to check access.\\n\\nAccess this article\\n-------------------\\n\\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y)\\n\\nSubscribe and save\\n------------------\\n\\nSpringer+ Basic\\n\\n$34.99 /Month\\n\\n*   Get 10 units per month\\n*   Download Article/Chapter or eBook\\n*   1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\\n*   Cancel anytime\\n\\n[Subscribe now](https://link.springer.com/product/springer-plus)\\n\\nBuy Now\\n-------\\n\\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\\n\\nPrice excludes VAT (USA) \\n\\n Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\\n\\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\\n\\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\\n\\n**Fig. 1**\\n\\n![Image 3](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y/MediaObjects/405_2023_8251_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n**Fig. 2**\\n\\n![Image 4](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-023-08251-y/MediaObjects/405_2023_8251_Fig2_HTML.png)\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n![Image 5](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-025-09471-0/MediaObjects/405_2025_9471_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n\\n### [Iatrogenic cholesteatoma: a tertiary referral center experience](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00405-025-09471-0?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle 03 June 2025\\n\\n![Image 6](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40463-016-0119-5/MediaObjects/40463_2016_119_Fig1_HTML.gif)\\n\\n### [Cochlear implant and congenital cholesteatoma](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s40463-016-0119-5?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle Open access 01 February 2016\\n\\n![Image 7](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00405-015-3767-6/MediaObjects/405_2015_3767_Fig1_HTML.gif)\\n\\n### [Hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00405-015-3767-6?fromPaywallRec=true)\\n\\nArticle 03 September 2015\\n\\n### Explore related subjects\\n\\nDiscover the latest articles and news from researchers in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\\n*   [Cochlea](https://link.springer.com/subjects/cochlea)\\n*   [Ear manifestations](https://link.springer.com/subjects/ear-manifestations)\\n*   [Head and Neck Surgery](https://link.springer.com/subjects/head-and-neck-surgery)\\n*   [Inner ear](https://link.springer.com/subjects/inner-ear)\\n*   [Otorhinolaryngology](https://link.springer.com/subjects/otorhinolaryngology)\\n*   [Surgery](https://link.springer.com/subjects/surgery)\\n\\nData availability\\n-----------------\\n\\nNot applicable.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n1.

      "Investigate and compile detailed information on surgical techniques, challenges, and risks associated with cochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment. Focus on electrode insertion strategies, risk of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, infection control, and postoperative complications. Include case reports and series that discuss outcomes and best practices in these complex surgical scenarios.\n",

      "## Surgical Techniques and Challenges in Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Staging and Timing**: Cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease cases with intact cholesteatoma capsule, or staged when disease extent or infection risk is high. Staged approaches involve subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration to isolate the cavity from the external environment, reducing risks of infection and implant extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Surgical Access and Electrode Insertion**: Unlike standard cochlear implantation where electrode insertion is done through posterior tympanotomy, ears with prior cholesteatoma surgery often involve canal wall down and radical cavities, necessitating alternate strategies to fix the electrode array close to the surface and stable fixation to prevent extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The round window approach is preferred for electrode insertion when anatomically feasible, but in cholesteatoma-treated ears, it can be obliterated by ossification or fibrosis from inflammation. Drilling (cochleostomy) may be required, demanding detailed anatomical knowledge due to altered structures and potential ossification of the cochlea basal turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Obliteration Techniques**: Subtotal petrosectomy combined with fat or bone pate obliteration of the mastoid and middle ear cavities is used to minimize dead space, reduce infection risk, and prevent recurrence, which is critical in cases with prior cholesteatoma. This also supports better implant stability and reduces extrusion risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Risk Factors: Residual/Recurrent Cholesteatoma, Infection, and Complications\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Residual or Recurrent Disease**: Risk of residual cholesteatoma exists especially in cases where complete removal is uncertain. Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examinations, is essential for early detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Aggressive disease or incomplete removal warrants staged implantation after eradication confirmed, to decrease risk of recurrent disease affecting the implant.\n",

Focus on diagnostic criteria including audiological thresholds, anatomical integrity, nerve function, and how ossicular chain disruptions and conductive hearing loss impact candidacy decisions.\\n\\n## Research Findings\\n\\n### General Cochlear Implant Candidacy Criteria\\n\\n- Candidacy criteria have evolved over time with technology improvements and clinical evidence supporting implantation in broader patient populations. Traditional criteria focused on bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but criteria have expanded to include patients with moderate to profound losses and asymmetric hearing loss, as well as single-sided deafness.\\n\\n- A \"revised 60/60 guideline\" is recommended for referral: Patients are candidates for CI evaluation if one or both ears have a pure tone average (PTA) of ≥ 60 dB HL and an unaided monosyllabic word recognition score ≤ 60%.\\n\\n- CI candidacy should be considered on an ear-specific basis rather than using the better ear as the reference point, with emphasis on speech recognition scores (≤ 50% on CNC word test in the ear to be implanted) and aided speech recognition testing (e.g., AzBio sentences in noise).\\n\\n- Hearing preservation is possible and residual low-frequency hearing should not be a contraindication; electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) should be considered in these cases.\\n\\n- A multidisciplinary evaluation involving audiologists, CI surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and support systems is critical for tailored candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\\n\\n- Factors such as duration of deafness, etiology, amplification use, cognitive status, motivation, and social support impact outcomes and should be considered in candidacy assessment.\\n\\n- Imaging (high-resolution CT and MRI) is used to assess cochlear and middle ear anatomy prior to implantation.\\n\\n- Vaccination against pneumococcal meningitis is recommended for all adult CI candidates.\\n\\n- Off-label implants beyond FDA labeling are common and should be considered when clinical evidence supports benefit.\\n\\n### Candidacy in Patients with Prior Tympanoplasty or Middle Ear Pathology\\n\\n- Middle ear pathology and prior surgeries (e.g., tympanoplasty) are not absolute contraindications but may affect timing and ear selection.\\n\\n- Middle ear must be free of active infection and dry before implantation.\\n\\n- Integrity of the cochlear lumen and cochlear nerve is essential, assessed by imaging.\\n\\n- Disruptions of the ossicular chain and conductive components need to be differentiated from sensorineural losses; mixed losses can affect candidacy and hearing aid benefit.\\n\\n### Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma\\n\\n- Patients with a history of cholesteatoma require careful assessment before CI.\\n\\n- Active, infected, or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma must be ruled out; the ear should be dry with no evidence of active disease prior to implantation.\\n\\n- The cochlear lumen and nerve must be intact.\\n\\n- Imaging (HRCT and MRI) is essential for preoperative evaluation and exclusion of recurrent disease.\\n\\n- Cholesteatoma removal and cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously if the cholesteatoma is limited and the capsule is intact, with use of laser vaporization to reduce recurrence risk.\\n\\n- In cases where the cholesteatoma is extensive, capsule integrity is lost, or recurrence risk is high, staging the procedure (removal first, implant later) is recommended.\\n\\n- A reported case describes discovery of congenital cholesteatoma found incidentally during sequential cochlear implantation in a child despite prior imaging, highlighting the possibility of occult disease in this population.\\n\\n- Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examination, is important to detect residual or recurrent disease.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implant candidacy has expanded beyond traditional severe-profound bilateral SNHL to include patients with residual hearing, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral deafness. For patients with prior middle ear surgeries like tympanoplasty and history of cholesteatoma, candidacy assessment requires careful multidisciplinary evaluation with attention to middle ear status. The ear should be free of infection and active disease, with confirmed cochlear and nerve integrity. Ossicular chain interruptions and conductive hearing loss components should be identified and differentiated as they influence candidacy decisions.\\n\\nIn cases of cholesteatoma, cochlear implantation is feasible if disease is eradicated and no residual pathology remains. Simultaneous cochlear implantation and cholesteatoma removal can be performed safely when the disease is limited and the cholesteatoma capsule intact with laser ablation to reduce recurrence. Otherwise, staged surgery is warranted. Thorough imaging preoperatively and close postoperative follow-up are essential.\\n\\nThese evidence-based criteria and clinical considerations should guide candidacy evaluations and surgical planning in this complex patient subset to optimize outcomes.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [American Cochlear Implant Alliance Task Force: Recommendations for Determining Cochlear Implant Candidacy in Adults (Laryngoscope, 2023)](https://www.audiology.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Laryngoscope-2023-Zeitler-American-Cochlear-Implant-Alliance-Task-Force-Recommendations-for-Determining-Cochlear.pdf)\\n\\n- [Cochlear implant and congenital cholesteatoma (Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery, 2016)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4736255/)\\n\\n- [Management of Cholesteatoma - Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024 Article)](https://www.oto.theclinics.com/article/S0030-6665(24)00111-7/fulltext)\\n\\n- [Clinical Practice Guideline: Cochlear Implants - American Speech-Language-Hearing Association](https://www.audiology.org/practice-guideline/clinical-practice-guideline-cochlear-implants/)\\n\\n- [Medicare Expands Cochlear Implant Candidacy Guidelines](https://neurotucson.com/medicare-expands-cochlear-implant-candidacy-guidelines/)\\n\\n## Images\\n\\n![Cochlear Implant: Audiogram showing hearing thresholds](https://entmanitoba.com/sites/default/files/styles/half_width/public/2023-05/Picture3.png?itok=SlspHvBu)\\n\\n![Graphic representing cochlear implant candidacy criteria for post-tympanoplasty cholesteatoma patients](https://assets.cochlear.com/api/public/content/1597f74884b249aeac497056925020fb?v=e6bcfa12)\\n</finding>\\n\\n## Existing Finding 2: Investigate Surgical Considerations and Risks for Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\\n\\n<finding>\\n# Problem Statement\\n\\nInvestigate and compile detailed information on surgical techniques, challenges, and risks associated with cochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment. Focus on electrode insertion strategies, risk of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, infection control, and postoperative complications. Include case reports and series that discuss outcomes and best practices in these complex surgical scenarios.\\n\\n# Research Findings\\n\\n## Surgical Techniques and Challenges in Cochlear Implantation after Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Treatment\\n\\n- **Staging and Timing**: Cochlear implantation can be performed simultaneously with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease cases with intact cholesteatoma capsule, or staged when disease extent or infection risk is high. Staged approaches involve subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration to isolate the cavity from the external environment, reducing risks of infection and implant extrusion.\\n\\n- **Surgical Access and Electrode Insertion**: Unlike standard cochlear implantation where electrode insertion is done through posterior tympanotomy, ears with prior cholesteatoma surgery often involve canal wall down and radical cavities, necessitating alternate strategies to fix the electrode array close to the surface and stable fixation to prevent extrusion.\\n\\n- The round window approach is preferred for electrode insertion when anatomically feasible, but in cholesteatoma-treated ears, it can be obliterated by ossification or fibrosis from inflammation. Drilling (cochleostomy) may be required, demanding detailed anatomical knowledge due to altered structures and potential ossification of the cochlea basal turn.\\n\\n- **Obliteration Techniques**: Subtotal petrosectomy combined with fat or bone pate obliteration of the mastoid and middle ear cavities is used to minimize dead space, reduce infection risk, and prevent recurrence, which is critical in cases with prior cholesteatoma. This also supports better implant stability and reduces extrusion risks.\\n\\n## Risk Factors: Residual/Recurrent Cholesteatoma, Infection, and Complications\\n\\n- **Residual or Recurrent Disease**: Risk of residual cholesteatoma exists especially in cases where complete removal is uncertain. Regular postoperative monitoring, including imaging and ear examinations, is essential for early detection.\\n\\n- Aggressive disease or incomplete removal warrants staged implantation after eradication confirmed, to decrease risk of recurrent disease affecting the implant.\\n\\n- **Infection Risk**: Prior middle ear pathology and surgeries heighten infection risk post-implantation. Infection can present as skin flap breakdown, implant extrusion, or rarely meningitis.\\n\\n- Combination of subtotal petrosectomy with obliteration techniques significantly reduces infection risk by disconnecting the middle ear cavity from the external environment.\\n\\n- Perioperative antibiotic strategies are applied variably but are important for infection prophylaxis.\\n\\n## Postoperative Complications and Outcomes\\n\\n- Postoperative complications reported include skin flap problems, implant extrusion, electrode exposure, and delayed infection.\\n\\n- Case series report low but nonzero prevalence of acquired cholesteatoma after cochlear implantation, sometimes necessitating explantation and staged reimplantation.\\n\\n- Hearing outcomes after cochlear implantation in ears previously treated for cholesteatoma and tympanoplasty are generally favorable when appropriate surgical techniques are used, although ossicular chain status and middle ear environment influence outcomes.\\n\\n- Large retrospective cohorts comparing bony obliteration tympanoplasty (BOT) to canal wall up/down without obliteration showed no significant differences in hearing outcomes but noted better hygiene and lower disease recurrence with BOT, supporting its use in complex cases.\\n\\n## Case Reports and Series Insights\\n\\n- Several reports highlight the feasibility and safety of simultaneous or staged cochlear implantation with cholesteatoma surgery in select patients.\\n\\n- One key approach is subtotal petrosectomy with fat obliteration combined with cochlear implantation to achieve disease control and implant stability.\\n\\n- Delayed complications such as electrode array exposure have been reported, emphasizing the need for meticulous surgical technique and postoperative follow-up.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nCochlear implantation in ears with a history of tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma treatment requires specialized surgical techniques distinct from standard implantation.

This is because a pathology anywhere from the pinna and the external acoustic meatus to the foot of the stapes bone can produce a conductive hearing loss (abnormal mechanical transmission of sound from the EAC to the cochlea).[[2]](#article-19834.r2) Many anatomical structures in this area are susceptible to a wide range of pathologies.\\n\\nConductive hearing loss is prevalent and affects a wide demographic, from the very young to the elderly.[[3]](#article-19834.r3) The causes can also range from the trivial otitis media with effusion in young children to potentially severe conditions such as an effusion caused by a nasopharyngeal tumor in adults. Thus, a thorough understanding of conductive hearing loss is paramount for all clinicians. Conductive hearing loss is a disease process frequently encountered by otolaryngologists, general practitioners, nurses, and audiologists.\\n\\n## Etiology\\n\\nConductive hearing loss can be produced by any defect in the pinna, external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles, up to the footplate of the stapes. Problems with the external ear and auditory canal may be due to congenital abnormalities such as aural atresia, which results in the incomplete formation of the external ear. This anomaly occurs due to the maldevelopment of the first and second branchial arches and the first branchial cleft.[[4]](#article-19834.r4) More commonly, problems arise at the external canal by obstruction from debris, wax, or foreign bodies. Perforation of the tympanic membrane can also cause a conductive hearing loss.[[5]](#article-19834.r5) Perforation can be attributed to trauma using cotton swabs to clean the ear, barotrauma from deep water diving, or as a sequela of otitis media.\\n\\nPathologies in the middle ear resulting in a conductive hearing loss include acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (commonly referred to as glue ear). Otitis media with effusion is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in children.[[6]](#article-19834.r6) In most cases, it is a transient issue, which often recovers spontaneously, and no further management other than monitoring is required. However, in some children, hearing loss can have disastrous consequences on speech and language development. Middle ear effusions in an adult should raise suspicion of a nasopharyngeal tumor (particularly a unilateral effusion or a refractory effusion) and should be investigated as such.[[7]](#article-19834.r7) Another serious cause of conductive hearing loss is cholesteatomas. These occur due to the presence of squamous epithelium in the middle ear or other aerated areas within the temporal bones. Although they are not tumors, they can be locally destructive and therefore require surgical removal.[[8]](#article-19834.r8) Restoration of hearing is a secondary objective behind the formation of a safe, dry ear.\\n\\nA defect in the ossicles of the middle ear will also give a conductive hearing loss. This could be due to head trauma resulting in ossicle discontinuity, or it could be due to a disease process such as otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is an osseous dyscrasia within the temporal bone.[[9]](#article-19834.r9) Spongy bone from the otic capsule gets replaced by sclerotic bone. This process predominantly affects the anterior oval window, resulting in calcification of the stapes or the annular ligament. Otosclerosis is twice as common in women and presents in early adulthood with a gradual onset of conductive hearing loss due to the stapes' fixation.\\n\\n## Epidemiology\\n\\nConductive hearing loss is common in younger patients due to conditions such as otitis media with effusion. A study on primary school children found the prevalence of hearing loss to be 15%, with 88.9% of those being conductive.[[10]](#article-19834.r10) Another study with preschool children in a South African community showed that 19% had hearing loss, with 65% of those being conductive.[[11]](#article-19834.r11) They found that 9% of children had impacted cerumen, causing a hearing loss in 19% of them. In a Canadian study in school children from kindergarten to grade 6, hearing loss was found in 19%, with 93% of those being conductive. They found perforations of the tympanic membrane in 37% if unilateral loss and 46% in the bilateral loss.[[12]](#article-19834.r12)\\n\\nIn low-middle income countries, hearing loss secondary to otitis media can be as high as 26%.[[13]](#article-19834.r13) Otosclerosis prevalence in the white population is 0.04% to 1% but increases to 5% in Asians, and is associated with bilateral hearing loss in up to 80% of cases.[[14]](#article-19834.r14) In the elderly population, hearing loss is mostly attributed to presbycusis, which is sensorineural.[[15]](#article-19834.r15)\\n\\n## History and Physical\\n\\nA thorough history can point towards the cause of the hearing loss. When obtaining the child's pertinent history, it is essential to ask about speech and language development and whether the appropriate milestones have been reached. Whether the child had preceding or recurrent upper respiratory tract infections must be ascertained, as this may suggest an otitis media with effusion. A conductive hearing loss can manifest as inappropriate behavior or inattention in the classroom.[[16]](#article-19834.r16)\\n\\nOther essential things in the history of children and adults include the onset of hearing loss, whether there was any trauma, and the presence of associated symptoms such as vertigo, otorrhoea, otalgia, and facial weakness. It would be prudent to ask about nasal discharge and weight loss in the older patient, indicating a postnasal space tumor. A child with a history of otitis media during the first two-three years of life are at risk for a mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss affecting phonological production. They can have difficulty perceiving strident or high-frequency consonants, such as sibilants. During speech they typically fail to produce these consonants, since they do not perceive them. This failure of sound production is called stridency deletion.\\n\\nIt is important to ask about family history and birth history to exclude any familial syndromes. Otosclerosis has an autosomal dominant with an incomplete penetrance mode of inheritance. It usually presents in the third decade of life and is twice as common in women as men. It has a gradual onset, and the hearing loss is bilateral in 80% of cases.[[17]](#article-19834.r17) The patient with otosclerosis may comment that their hearing is better with background noise (paracusis Willisii). This phenomenon can occur as well in other causes of conductive hearing loss.\\n\\nA full otolaryngology examination is mandatory for patients with hearing loss. Both ears must be examined with an otoscope or microscope. The examiner can see an obstruction of the ear canal with cerumen, debris, or a foreign body. Stenosis of the canal, which may be congenital or the consequence of repeated infections, can be seen. The tympanic membranes must be visualized to exclude acute infections, effusions, perforations, hemotympanum, or the presence of a cholesteatoma. Approximately 90% of patients with otosclerosis have normal tympanic membranes, while 10% have a pink tinge called Schwartz’s sign.[[18]](#article-19834.r18) If an adult is noted to have an effusion, then a flexible nasoendoscopy should be performed in the clinic to view the postnasal space.[[19]](#article-19834.r19)\\n\\nWeber and Rinne tuning fork tests are useful screening tests, which can be carried out in the clinic to see whether hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural.[[20]](#article-19834.r20) They are better suited for unilateral hearing loss and when the hearing loss is not of the mixed type. Cases of bilateral hearing loss or mixed hearing losses are better assessed using pure tone audiometry rather than tuning fork tests. To perform the Weber test, a 512Hz tuning fork is struck on the clinician's knee or elbow, and the vibrating fork is placed in the vertex of the patient’s head of the midline of the forehead. A normal result is a tuning fork being heard equally in both ears. In a conductive hearing loss, the tuning fork will be heard louder in the affected ear. In a sensorineural hearing loss, the tuning fork will be heard louder in the unaffected ear. This is used in conjunction with the Rinne test, where again a vibrating 512Hz tuning fork is placed, this time on the mastoid process until the patient can no longer hear it, and then 1cm away from the external acoustic meatus. A normal result is when air conduction is heard better than bone conduction (paradoxically called Rinne positive). If bone conduction is superior to air conduction (Rinne negative), a conductive hearing loss is present.\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\nPure tone audiometry is the mainstay of investigations for hearing loss. It can confirm the presence of hearing loss, quantify the severity, and determine the nature of the hearing loss.[[21]](#article-19834.r21) Headphones deliver sounds in varying loudness over 250 to 8000 Hz. The patient notifies the audiologist when they hear the sounds 50% of the time. This is a measure of the air conduction threshold and is recorded in decibels (dB). The bone conduction threshold is determined by placing a transducer on the mastoid process. An air-bone gap exists when bone conduction is superior to air conduction.[[22]](#article-19834.r22) This is significant when the gap is over 10dB and marks a conductive hearing loss. Usually, an air-bone gap over 40dB indicates pathology within the ossicular chain rather than solely a tympanic membrane pathology. A Carhart notch is where there is a depression in bone conduction of around 10 to 15dB at 2kHz.[[23]](#article-19834.r23) This is indicative of stapes fixation, as seen in otosclerosis.\\n\\nPure tone audiometry is suitable for patients over four years old. For younger children, there are alternative tests such as play and visual reinforcement audiometry. These are all subjective hearing tests. Acoustic impedance audiometry, also called tympanometry, provides some objective evidence for the examination. Tympanometry generates a graph of the tympanic membrane's compliance and gives useful information about the middle ear pressures.[[24]](#article-19834.r24)\\n\\nThe work-up for a patient with a suspected cholesteatoma should include a computed tomographic scan of the petrous temporal bones. Brain and cervical magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium may be subsequently recommended to exclude tumor pathologies of the posterior fossa, temporal bone, and neck/oropharynx areas.\\n\\n## Treatment / Management\\n\\nThe treatment of conductive hearing loss is dependent on the underlying condition. Any foreign body should be removed under direct visualization, with the aid of a microscope if required.[[25]](#article-19834.r25) Wax and debris which is obstructing the ear canal should be amenable to micro-suction. Perforations of the tympanic membrane often heal independently and only require a clinic follow-up evaluation in 6-8 weeks to ensure total healing.[[26]](#article-19834.r26) If the perforation has not sealed, then a myringoplasty may be necessary; however, the hearing effects are somewhat more unpredictable.\\n\\nOtitis media with effusion usually resolves by itself and can just be monitored every three months. However, if persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion occurs over three months, and the hearing loss in the better ear is over 25-30dB, grommet insertion may be valuable.[[27]](#article-19834.r27) Grommets enable ventilation of the middle ear to the external auditory canal, rather than ventilating to the nasopharynx via the Eustachian tubes. A myringotomy is performed, and any middle ear fluid is suctioned out before a grommet is placed in the anteroinferior quadrant. Adenoidectomy can also be performed if there is associated hearing loss with the effusions.[[28]](#article-19834.r28) The most common complications of grommets are infections and rarely tympanosclerosis. Grommets are favored to tympanostomy tubes (T-tubes) as the latter have higher rates of complications.[[29]](#article-19834.r29)\\n\\nCholesteatomas require complete surgical excision. The two main approaches to a mastoidectomy are canal wall down, which involves an endaural or postaural incision, or canal wall up, which involves a postauricular incision.[[30]](#article-19834.r30) Trauma resulting in ossicle discontinuity may require an ossiculoplasty. Management options for otosclerosis include conservative measures such as watchful waiting, hearing aids, and fluoride supplementation. Surgery may be indicated when the air-bone gap is over 20 dB and involve total/partial stapedectomy or stapedotomy.[[31]](#article-19834.r31) Conductive hearing loss that is not amenable to medical or surgical management can be treated with hearing aids. There are various types: air conduction hearing aids, bone conduction hearing aids, and bone-anchored hearing aid.\\n\\n## Differential Diagnosis\\n\\nThe differential diagnosis for conductive hearing loss is extensive. A thorough history and examination, together with pure tone audiometry, will point towards the underlying cause. It is essential to confirm that the hearing loss is conductive rather than sensorineural, guiding subsequent investigations and management.\\n\\n## Prognosis\\n\\nPrognosis is very much dependent on the cause of the conductive hearing loss. Simple conditions such as wax impaction and otitis media with effusion have excellent outcomes.[[32]](#article-19834.r32)[[33]](#article-19834.r33) Even when hearing loss is not reversible or amenable to medical or surgical management, hearing aids have a high satisfaction rate amongst patients.[[34]](#article-19834.r34)[[35]](#article-19834.r35)\\n\\n## Complications\\n\\nThe following complications may be observed:\\n\\n## Consultations\\n\\nConsultations from otolaryngologists, neuro otologist, and audiologist may be required.\\n\\n## Deterrence and Patient Education\\n\\nPatients must realize that hearing loss, mainly if it is conductive, is treatable and should seek medical help if they noticed it. Hearing aids can be highly effective in cases when hearing loss is not treatable. Parents and teachers must be aware that misbehavior or inattention at school can be a sign of hearing loss, and prompt diagnosis can prevent speech and language delays. Patients should be instructed not to introduce sharp objects to clean the ear. The use of cotton swabs should be restricted to the most outer part of the external ear canal. Cotton swabs can push the wax deeper into the ear canal. In most cases, cleaning the ear canal should not be done with a cotton swab as the wax usually fall out on its own.\\n\\n## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes\\n\\nHearing loss is a frequent problem affecting all ages. Careful diagnosis and treatment are required in many cases to prevent further complications. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary when managing conductive hearing loss, including otolaryngologists, audiologists, general practitioners, and specialty nurses. Pediatricians should closely follow patients with otitis media for recurrent episodes and problems in school learning and performance. Recommendations from all members of the team are obtained to achieve the best possible outcome for the patient. Using evidence-based information, the best results can be obtained.\\n\\n## Review Questions\\n\\n## References\\n\\n**Disclosure:** Thushanth Sooriyamoorthy declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\\n\\n**Disclosure:** Orlando De Jesus declares no relevant financial relationships with ineligible companies.\\n\\nThis book is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\\n([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)), which permits others to distribute the work, provided that the article is not altered or used commercially.

This study aimed at evaluating their effectiveness in rehabilitation of hearing loss.\\n\\n### Methods\\n\\nThis study included patients who received bone conduction implants at Tertiary Teaching Hospitals, between December 2018 and November 2020. Data were collected prospectively, and patients were assessed both subjectively using COSI and GHABP questionnaires and objectively using bone conduction and air conduction thresholds, unaided and aided free field speech thresholds. Outcomes of transcutaneous (tBCHD) and percutaneous (pBCHD) bone conduction hearing devices were compared as well as outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral fitting. Postoperative skin complications were recorded and compared.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nA total of seventy patients were included, thirty-seven of them were implanted with tBCHD and thirty-three with pBCHD. Fifty-five patients were fitted unilaterally compared to 15 bilateral fitting. Preoperative mean of bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample was 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) with _P_ value = 0.00001. The postoperative assessment using GHABP showed a benefit score mean of 70.95 ± 18.79, patient satisfaction score mean of 78.15 ± 18.39. The disability score improved significantly from a mean of 54.08 ± 15.26 to residual score of only 12.50 ± 10.22 with _P_< 0.00001 postoperatively. There was significant improvement in all parameters of COSI questionnaire following fitting. Comparison of pBCHDs vs tBCHDs showed a non-significant difference regarding FF speech as well as GHABP parameters. Comparison of the post-operative skin complications was in favor of tBCHDs as (86.5%) of the patients had normal skin postoperatively, compared to 45.5% of patients with pBCHDs devices. Bilateral implantation showed significant improvement of FF speech scores, GHABP satisfaction score, as well as COSI score results.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBone conduction hearing devices are effective solution for rehabilitation of hearing loss. Bilateral fitting yields satisfactory outcomes in suitable candidates. Transcutaneous devices carry significantly lower skin complication rates compared to percutaneous devices.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Implantable hearing device, Deafness, BAHA, Osia, Bone conduction\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nConventional air conduction hearing aids (ACHA) are the standard of care for rehabilitation of moderate-to-severe hearing loss worldwide while cochlear implants are reserved for those with severe to profound hearing deficiencies [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR1)]. Patients with moderate to severe hearing loss who have no benefit from ACHAs or unable to wear them for various reasons needed an innovative option such as implantable hearing devices to fulfill their needs [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR2)].\\n\\nImplantable hearing devices have been developed to rehabilitate a wider range of hearing loss and overcome many of the drawbacks of the ACHAs that includes occlusion effect, inadequate gain and unacceptable look. The available implantable hearing devices nowadays are subdivided into two major categories: active middle ear implants (AMEI) and Bone Conduction Hearing Devices (BCHDs) [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR3)]. They differ in indications, design, technique of implantation, as well as aftercare needed for each device [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR5)].\\n\\nBCHDs are classified into passive BCHDs (e.g., BAHA—either connect or attract- or the Ponto device by _Oticon_) and active BCHDs (e.g., Med-EL Bonebridge® [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR7)] and the new Osia® system by _Cochlear Ltd_) [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR9)]_._ These devices are indicated in patients with conductive hearing loss (CHL), mixed hearing loss (MHL) or in single sided deafness (SSD) with stable bone conduction hearing thresholds(BC) within the recommended manufacturer’s range [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. BAHA attract is a passive transcutaneous bone conduction hearing devices (tBCHD) that delivers sound waves to a passive implant magnet across an intact skin barrier whilst Osia®& Bonebridge® are active tBCHDs where the processor transfers acoustic information to the active receiver stimulator package across intact skin which in turn actively recreates the sound signal for transmission by bone conduction [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. BAHA Connect and the Oticon Ponto are percutaneous devices (pBCHDs) which connect to the processor via a skin-penetrating abutment [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR8), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10)]. Bilateral BCHD fitting has been recently evaluated and shown promising results including increased ability of sound localization, higher audiological gain as well as enhanced hearing ability in presence of noise [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR12)]. The aim of the work was a broader audiological and surgical comparative evaluation of effectiveness of tBCHDs and pBCHDs in rehabilitation of hearing loss and comparison of bilateral vs unilateral fitting outcomes.\\n\\nMethods\\n-------\\n\\nThis study was a prospective comparative cohort study conducted in the tertiary Regional Department of Otology and Neurotology spanning the period between 1st December 2018 and 30th November 2020. This study was registered with the Clinical Effectiveness Unit (CEU 9334) who also provided the independent review; hence no separate ethical approval was needed. All patient data were anonymised and protected with compliance to Data Protection Act 2018. To be included in our study, patients had to fulfill the following criteria: patients aged 16 years and over with hearing loss (either conductive or mixed type or single sided deafness with normal or near normal BC thresholds of the other side), BC thresholds within BCHD manufacturer’s recommended guidelines, those who have not derived adequate benefit from conventional ACHAs. To be included patients had to have stable bone conduction hearing thresholds (up to 45 dB for Bonebridge® or up to 55 dB for Osia®) within the widely accepted maximal power output of the device. Patients outside the implantation criteria of National Health Services (NHS) Specialised Commissioning Guidelines (2016) were excluded.\\n\\nSeventy-four patients were recruited into our study; patients were allocated into two groups. Four patients dropped out from the study due to different reasons (three patients were lost follow-up and one patient discontinued using the device). The final number of patients included was 70 patients. Group (A) _n_ = 33: Included all patients pBCHD (BAHA connect or Oticon Ponto devices) and Group (B) _n_ = 37: Included all patients with tBCHDs (BAHA attract, Osia®, and Bonebridge® devices). We have also compared the outcome of patients fitted with BCHD bilaterally (15 patients) to patients fitted unilaterally (55 patients).\\n\\nAll patients were reviewed in the BCHD multidisciplinary team clinic employing the pre-operative assessment protocol that included history taking, full examination and audiological evaluation including unaided and aided free field (FF) thresholds and unaided Pure tone average (PTA) mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz as well as adaptive speech recognition in noise and quiet.\\n\\nSuitable candidates were counselled regarding the different types of BCHDs. Choice of the appropriate device depended on multiple factors including patient’s hearing threshold, maximal power output of the devices, indication for implantation, type of hearing loss as well as patient’s own preference. As part of their pre-operative assessment, patients were offered a 14-day trial of a BCHD (on loan) using a soft band to mimic post-operative situation and were asked to record a diary of their trial of the device. An informed consent was signed by the patient prior to surgical procedure. For assessment of patient’s quality of life and comparing it to pre-implantation situation; we have utilized two of the widely accepted questionnaires; the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) and the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire.\\n\\nSurgical procedures were carried out as per manufacturer's guidelines for the selected device. For BAHA Connect device; incision was marked to be 2–3 cm long behind the ear and parallel with hair line, with marking the implant site 1 cm posterior to the planned incision line. Drilling is done using a guide drill and a countersink, followed by placement of the implant and the skin-penetrating abutment. For BAHA attract implant, incision is marked to be 2–3 cm long behind the ear and parallel with hair line, with marking the implant site 1 cm posterior to the planned incision line and planned as inferiorly based C-shaped fashion, an internal magnet is secured to the implanted fixture under the skin and incision is closed in layers. In case of Bonebridge implantation, Incision is made further posterior to the implant site with attention to thickness of the overlying skin flap, followed by drilling a bed for floating mass transducer(FMT) and a periosteal pocket for the attached coil, then the BB is fixed with titanium screws and wound is closed in layers. Patients were reviewed in the outpatient clinic 1 week postoperatively for stitch removal and wound check. Loading, activation, and programming were done during the 4th week of surgery to allow for osseointegration to take place (in case of pBCHDs).\\n\\nOur primary outcome measures included hearing and quality of life assessment (QOL) in the form of aided audiometry (FF thresholds and PTA [Mean of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz]), aided assessment using GHABP and COSI questionnaires. The Secondary outcome measures were skin assessment for complications using Holger’s classification (for tBCHD), comparison of the outcomes of (tBCHDS) vs (pBCHDs) as well as comparison of the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral implantation with BCHDs.\\n\\n### Statistical analysis\\n\\nData analysis was performed using R software version 3.4.4 (R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna). Our figures were generated using the R package “ggplot2”. Categorical outcomes were expressed as counts/frequencies. Meanwhile, the numerical outcomes were presented in the form of mean, standard deviation (SD). Qualitative data were compared via Chi-square (_χ_ 2) test. Pre-operative and postoperative audiometric values were compared using Wilcoxon test. Results with _P_ value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\nResults\\n-------\\n\\nThe mean age of our patients was 53.47 ± 16.59 SD years, and majority of the patients were females (39 cases—45.7%). The commonest hearing loss pattern was mixed hearing loss (MHL) in 58.6% of the overall sample (Fig.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Fig1)). Unilateral implantation was done in 55 cases (78.6%), with tBCHDs as the commonest modality implanted in 52.9%. Preoperative audiological assessment showed a mean of Bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample of 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, while the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) (_P_ = 0.00001) (Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Tab1)).\\n\\n### Fig. 1.\\n\\n[![Image 9: Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b2b5/9946869/d8d496582ad6/405_2023_7889_Fig1_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9946869_405_2023_7889_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/figure/Fig1/)\\n\\nTypes of hearing loss of the patients in relation to device type\\n\\n### Table 1.\\n\\nOverall sociodemographic and clinical data\\n\\n| Parameter | Overall |\\n| :--- | :--- |\\n| _N_ | 70 |\\n| Age (mean (SD)) | 53.47 (16.59) |\\n| Gender |  |\\n| Male | 31 (44.3) |\\n| Female | 39 (45.7) |\\n| Hearing loss type (%) |\\n| CHL | 15 (21.4) |\\n| Mixed | 41 (58.6) |\\n| SSD | 14 (20.0) |\\n| Laterality |  |\\n| Unilateral (%) | 55 (78.6) |\\n| Bilateral (%) | 15(21.4) |\\n| Device (%) |\\n| Transcutaneous | 37 (52.9) |\\n| Percutaneous | 33 (47.1) |\\n| Device type (%) |\\n| BAHA attract | 20 (28.6) |\\n| BAHA connect | 28 (40.0) |\\n| BAHA connect converted to attract | 1 (1.4) |\\n| Bone bridge | 8 (11.4) |\\n| OSIA | 9 (12.9) |\\n| Oticon Ponto | 4 (5.7) |\\n| Pre-op Audiological data |\\n| BC(dB) (mean ± SD) | 23.27 ± 10.91 |\\n| AC(dB) (mean ± SD) | 69.27 ± 13.75 |\\n\\n|  |  | Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test | _P_ value |\\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\\n| FF speech unaided (%) (mean ± SD) | 88.51 ± 7.92 | _z_ = −6.9588 | < 0.00001 |\\n| FF speech aided (%) (mean ± SD) | 96.79 ± 2.38 |\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/table/Tab1/)\\n\\nThe postoperative GHABP showed a mean benefit score of 70.95 ± 18.79 SD and mean patient satisfaction score of 78.15 ± 18.39 SD.

Such devices improved quality of life (QoL) for a great sector among the hard of hearing community suffering from a wide range of ear conditions causing moderate to severe hearing loss. The pBCHDs were the first to be developed. Despite their drawbacks of skin infection/overgrowth, these devices remain a viable option due to their simplicity and greater audiological gain in comparison to ACHAs and tBCHDs [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR9)].\\n\\nThe tBCHDs were developed to overcome the soft tissue linked drawbacks of percutaneous devices. Such devices are more aesthetically accepted and overcome skin complications occurring due to the skin-penetrating abutment used in pBCHDs. The use of BCHDs is widely approved in health care systems around the developed world. However, they are not widely or uniformly available in developing countries due to its higher cost compared to conventional ACHAs although there is steady growth in availability and uptake [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR10)].\\n\\nRecently, bilateral fitting was approved in certain countries including the UK, where it was approved in 2016 [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11)]. Few studies evaluated the effectiveness of such fitting versus unilateral fitting since then. Hence, it is imperative that their effectiveness is evaluated periodically to ensure they are appropriate for hearing impairment.\\n\\nThe outcomes of patients fitted with unilateral (55 patients) and bilateral (15 patients) BCHDs match the expected outcomes in manufacturer's recommendations as well as the NHS commissioning guidelines in the UK [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR12)].\\n\\nThe patient reported pre- and post-fitting GHABP scores consistent improvement in most domains (a benefit score of 70.95 ± 18.79, a satisfaction score of 78.15 ± 18.39, and reduction in the disability score from 54.08 ± 15.26 down to 12.50 ± 10.22 after fitting). These results are in line with many similar studies. One of the earliest was done by Mcdermott et al. in 2002, who compared the conventional ACHA with the BAHA system utilizing both GHABP and GHADP, with a total of 84 adult patients interviewed. Both benefit and satisfaction of patients were significantly better with the use of BAHA compared to ACHAs [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR13)]. Also, Scotta et al. in 2020 compared the GHABP results of BAHA Attract Vs Bonebridge cases. Both groups attained high results in the form of a mean global score of 83 (standard deviation (SD) ± 23.5) in the Bonebridge group and 84 (SD ± 15.3) in the BAHA Attract group [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR14)]. Wazen et al. (2021) assessed the hearing and quality of life outcomes for SSD patients implanted with BAHA retrospectively and showed significant improvement regarding all measures of the GHABP including disability scores, benefit, and satisfaction of their patients [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR15)].\\n\\nAlthough the use of GHABP gives great information aiding to assess the effectiveness of BCHDs, it carries a recall bias as acquiring the information at the follow up stage requires patients to recall the types and degrees of difficulty that they were facing some weeks ago prior to fitting. This carries difficulty, especially for some elderly persons. To overcome this problem, we have asked the patients to fill in the first two columns of the questionnaire prior to surgical interference requesting them to pick their 4 custom situations according to their daily needs, then they were asked to complete the questionnaire one month following fitting.\\n\\nIn the current study, we have also used the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) questionnaire as a tool for subjective assessment of hearing. The included patients showed significant improvement for all the subscales of COSI questionnaire following fitting with the BCHD as all parameters have improved in 95% of the time for most of the patients. These results are again in line with Scotta et al. who studied the surgical and audiological outcomes of two transcutaneous devices using different outcome measures including the COSI questionnaire. Patients showed improvement in 5 listening situations, including conversation in noise, conversation in quiet places, listening to music, watching TV, and directionality of sound. This improvement was at scales of 75% and 95% of the time in all cases [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR14)].\\n\\nThe audiological outcome of patients using free field speech scores showed significant improvement (_P_< 0.00001) with an aided score of 96.79 ± 2.38 (mean ± SD) compared to an unaided score of 88.51 ± 7.92 preoperatively. All these results are in favor of using the BCHDs as an effective way in the rehabilitation of hearing loss for suitable candidates. These results are supported by many studies published since the early introduction of BCHDs into the market. Dimitriadis et al. (2017) on a study looking at over a hundred patients implanted with BAHA Attract device showed a significant fall in the disability scores of GHABP from 52.4 to 10.6 (_P_< 0.001). The GHABP benefit score was 88.1% and the satisfaction GHABP score was 77.4% [[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR16)]. A multi-center study done by Nevoux et al. in 2018 to evaluate the long-term outcomes of BAHA Attract tBCHD system concluded that BAHA Attract implantation results in a significant hearing gain and improved QOL. They favored using this implant due to its reversibility that allows switching to another system if hearing deteriorates over time [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR17)]. Marszal and colleagues (2022) also studied the long-term impact of BAHA Attract on quality of life for their patients using different parameters. They showed a significant improvement, and most patients were satisfied with the aesthetic and usability aspects of the device [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR18)]. On a wider scale, Magele et al. in 2019 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of active tBCHDs. All outcomes reported confirmed significant audiological gain and high patient satisfaction, as well as low complications rate [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR19)].\\n\\nIn our study, we have compared the outcomes of bilateral implantation of BCHDs vs unilateral implantation. Few published studies have discussed benefits of bilateral implantations till date, and the published data still lack convincing evidence to rely on. Patients are often implanted unilaterally on the side of greater hearing loss, or the patient’s preferred ear for those with symmetrical bilateral losses [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR20)]. However, the evidence for the use of bilateral devices is slowly evolving. Initially, they were a controversial issue, as it was felt that one device can stimulate both cochlea and provide an accepted level of amplification to both sides [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR22)]. Despite this, the NHS started commissioning bilateral BCHD implantation in 2016 due to the patient reported benefits. It has been marked however, that the studies on bilateral BCHDs were poor in evidence [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR23)].\\n\\nIn the current study, there was significant difference in favor of bilateral implantation regarding audiological testing including FF speech in both unaided (_P_ = 0.003) and aided (_P_< 0.001) conditions, respectively. The GHABP satisfaction score was significantly higher in bilaterally implanted patients 88.01 ± 12.76 compared to 75.46 ± 18.85 (_P_ = 0.018). Bilaterally implanted patients had significantly worse Initial disability raw score (mean ± SD) = 65.25 ± 14.64 compared to 51.03 ± 14.07 for unilaterally implanted cohort. Results of COSI outcomes showed significant improvement, favoring bilaterally fitted patients with regard to conversation both in quiet situations (_P_ = 0.001) and with groups (_P_ = 0.026). Both groups were similar in situations such as watching TV, conversation in noise and social contact.\\n\\nHilly and colleagues (2020) conducted an interesting study to compare unilateral versus bilateral implantation with regard to hearing in noisy situations. Bilateral amplification was significantly better when signals were presented from the front and noise was presented from both sides. They concluded that bilateral amplification with BCHDs can improve hearing in noise in the binaural implantation [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR24)]. Chin et al. (2021) also demonstrated better hearing threshold, speech reception thresholds in noise and directional hearing with bilateral simultaneous implantation with the tBCHD Bonebridge devices [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR25)]. Similarly, Caspers et al. (2022) studied the efficacy of bilateral implantation with pBCHDs on sound localization [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR26)]. Heath et al. (2021) published a systematic review to assess the outcomes of bilaterally fitted patients. The results of the included studies showed that bilateral BCHDs offer considerable benefit to patients. For the audiological outcomes, improvements were seen in thresholds and understanding speech in quiet and sound localization, as well as restoration of binaural hearing ability. Bilateral BCHDs showed less response in the speech detection in noise. Further advantages of bilateral implantation were found in the QoL results, with all studies reporting overall improvements [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR11), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR27)]. Improvements were noted by parents and teachers for those with bilateral losses and bilateral BCHDs compared to unilateral BCHDs [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR21)]. These results might support a second implant for eligible cases, However, an assessment of the potential drawbacks such as additional surgical complications and costs, needs to be conducted to justify the risk of this surgery.\\n\\nIn the current study, we have compared the pBCHDs versus the tBCHDs regarding subjective and objective outcomes and skin complications. There was non-significant difference between both categories regarding FF speech in the unaided and aided conditions. Both tBCHDs and pBCHDs showed significant improvement of GHABP disability scores with _P_< 0.0001, with non-significant difference between both categories.\\n\\nPost-operative skin complications were recorded and compared. There was significant difference in favor of transcutaneous devices (_P_ = 0.002) (Fig.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#Fig3)). It is well established that percutaneous devices carry the risk of post-operative skin complications ranging from mild redness and erythema up to skin breakdown and skin overgrowth on top of the abutment requiring daily care to avoid such complications. This is due to the nature of the skin-penetrating abutment. Transcutaneous devices have been developed to overcome such a drawback, but percutaneous devices still have its share of the market and still preferred by many surgeons as well as patients; due to its easier surgical procedure and clear audiological gain. The overall reported skin infection/reaction rate in the literature ranged from 1.2 to 52.4% [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR28)].\\n\\nSiau et al. (2012) reported very low skin-related complication rates (1.2%) suggesting that soft tissues above the periosteum, including all the hair follicles, could be excised leaving the periosteum itself intact to reduce such complications [[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR29)]. Priwin et al. in 2005 suggested that daily cleaning could help avoid skin infections [[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR30)]. The study by Chan et al. in 2017 encouraged minimal soft-tissue reduction, as 60% of their cohort that received full-thickness flaps developed major complications compared to 10% for those with no soft-tissue reduction technique [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR31)]. In our series of patients, we did not resort to perform tissue reduction, which may justify the expected skin complication rate. Godbehere et al. (2017) in a comparative study of complications and initial follow-up costs of transcutaneous and percutaneous bone conduction devices showed that percutaneous group had higher rate of skin complications (20%). with three patients (12%) necessitating removal of the abutment despite treatment with antibiotics compared to, only one patient in the transcutaneous device group having minor skin irritation [[32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR32)]. In 2021, Hernández et al. published a retrospective study evaluating the long-term cutaneous complications related to tBCHDs spanning the period between 2004 and 2018. Out of the total of patients, 49 (55.7%) developed at least one episode of inflammatory/infectious skin reaction. These rates are higher than most of published skin changes related to tBCHDs in literature. This could be explained by the long follow-up period in their study [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9946869/#CR33)].\\n\\nWhilst still undergoing rapid innovation and refinement, BCHDs are considered a great addition to the audiological armamentarium to improve the quality of life of hard of hearing individuals due to their role in hearing rehabilitation when ACHAs are not effective.\\n\\nOur study was focused on adult patients and was partly limited by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic restricting the number of surgical procedures in the latter part of the study period.\\n\\nIn conclusion, BCHDs are effective in rehabilitation of hearing loss whenever indicated. Both transcutaneous and percutaneous devices showed significant reduction of patients’ disability scores. Postoperative skin complications remain higher in patients fitted with percutaneous devices. Bilateral fitting is favorable where indicated; due to its significant impact on subjective outcomes and improved binaural hearing, sound localization and patient’s self-confidence.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n----------------\\n\\nThe corresponding author would like to express his gratitude to Newton-Mosharafa Fund & the Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education, who supported his presence in the UK via a joint supervision mission for PhD studies.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\n--------------------\\n\\nJR: main surgeon and supervisor of the surgical procedures.

This study aimed at evaluating their effectiveness in rehabilitation of hearing loss.\\n\\n**Methods:** This study included patients who received bone conduction implants at Tertiary Teaching Hospitals, between December 2018 and November 2020. Data were collected prospectively, and patients were assessed both subjectively using COSI and GHABP questionnaires and objectively using bone conduction and air conduction thresholds, unaided and aided free field speech thresholds. Outcomes of transcutaneous (tBCHD) and percutaneous (pBCHD) bone conduction hearing devices were compared as well as outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral fitting. Postoperative skin complications were recorded and compared.\\n\\n**Results:** A total of seventy patients were included, thirty-seven of them were implanted with tBCHD and thirty-three with pBCHD. Fifty-five patients were fitted unilaterally compared to 15 bilateral fitting. Preoperative mean of bone conduction (BC) of the overall sample was 23.27 ± 10.91 dB, the Air conduction (AC) mean was 69.27 ± 13.75 dB. There was significant difference between unaided free field speech score (88.51% ± 7.92) and the aided score (96.79 ± 2.38) with P value = 0.00001. The postoperative assessment using GHABP showed a benefit score mean of 70.95 ± 18.79, patient satisfaction score mean of 78.15 ± 18.39. The disability score improved significantly from a mean of 54.08 ± 15.26 to residual score of only 12.50 ± 10.22 with P < 0.00001 postoperatively. There was significant improvement in all parameters of COSI questionnaire following fitting. Comparison of pBCHDs vs tBCHDs showed a non-significant difference regarding FF speech as well as GHABP parameters. Comparison of the post-operative skin complications was in favor of tBCHDs as (86.5%) of the patients had normal skin postoperatively, compared to 45.5% of patients with pBCHDs devices. Bilateral implantation showed significant improvement of FF speech scores, GHABP satisfaction score, as well as COSI score results.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Bone conduction hearing devices are effective solution for rehabilitation of hearing loss. Bilateral fitting yields satisfactory outcomes in suitable candidates. Transcutaneous devices carry significantly lower skin complication rates compared to percutaneous devices.\\n\\n**Keywords:** BAHA; Bone conduction; Deafness; Implantable hearing device; Osia.\\n\\n© 2023.

      "Gather data on non-implant hearing rehabilitation strategies for patients with conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage but intact cochlea and nerve, including bone conduction devices and middle ear implants. Assess comparative effectiveness, patient candidacy overlap, and prognostic indicators to build a holistic recommendation framework.\n",

      "## Hearing Rehabilitation Options for Conductive Hearing Loss with Intact Cochlea and Nerve\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview of Conductive Hearing Loss and Non-Implant Rehabilitation\n",
      "\n",
      "- Conductive hearing loss (CHL) results commonly from ossicular damage or middle ear pathology that impairs mechanical sound transmission, while cochlea and auditory nerve remain intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Non-implant hearing rehabilitation strategies aim to bypass or augment the defective middle ear system, improving sound conduction to the cochlea.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Conventional air conduction hearing aids are often limited in patients with significant ossicular damage or chronic middle ear pathology.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In these cases, bone conduction devices and middle ear implants become important alternatives for rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bone Conduction Devices (BCDs)\n",
      "\n",
      "- BCDs transmit vibrations through the skull bone directly to the cochlea, bypassing the external auditory canal and middle ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Two main types exist: percutaneous devices with an abutment penetrating the skin (e.g., BAHA Connect) and transcutaneous devices that transmit vibrations magnetically through intact skin (e.g., BAHA Attract, Bonebridge, Osia).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Candidacy criteria commonly consider patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, single-sided deafness, and stable bone conduction thresholds within device specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Studies show significant improvement in hearing sensitivity, speech recognition in quiet and noise, and quality of life with BCDs in suitable candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral fitting of BCDs can further enhance sound localization, binaural hearing, and subjective satisfaction compared to unilateral fitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Transcutaneous devices have lower rates of skin complications compared to percutaneous but may offer slightly reduced audiological gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Selection of device type depends on patient anatomy, medical history, aesthetic preferences, and risk of skin complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Long-term outcomes demonstrate substantial benefit with reduced disability scores and high patient satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Middle Ear Implants (MEIs)\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs are implanted devices that mechanically stimulate the middle ear structures (ossicles or cochlea) and can be used in patients with conductive, mixed, and sensorineural hearing loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs bypass the external auditory canal and can be used when air conduction aids are not effective or tolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs generally require intact cochlear function; thus, they are suitable for conductive losses with cochlear nerve integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Evidence shows MEIs have comparable safety and effectiveness to bone-anchored hearing aids in improving hearing thresholds and quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "- MEIs require surgical implantation and are less widely available than BCDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Their use is often considered when patients have mixed hearing losses or inability to use other hearing aids due to anatomical or medical reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comparative Effectiveness and Patient Candidacy Overlap\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both BCDs and MEIs are indicated for conductive or mixed hearing loss with intact cochlea and nerve.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comparative studies suggest similar improvements in hearing outcome measures and subjective benefit, though literature is limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "- BCDs are often preferred for conductive losses with stable bone conduction thresholds; MEIs may be selected for mixed losses or when middle ear conditions preclude bone-anchored implants.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral BCD fitting is beneficial but not universally applied; MEI bilateral implantation data are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Optimal device selection depends on audiologic profile, middle ear status, patient preference, surgical risk, and device availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Prognostic Indicators\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hearing improvement depends on stable cochlear function, absence of active middle ear disease, and appropriate device selection respecting thresholds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Patients with conductive loss due to ossicular damage but intact cochlea have good prognosis with appropriate device rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Duration of hearing loss, patient motivation, cognitive status, and rehabilitation support impact outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bilateral device fitting tends to produce better localization, binaural hearing, and subjective quality of life metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Skin complications are an important consideration in percutaneous BCD users; transcutaneous devices have better skin tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Illustrations and Visuals\n",
      "\n",
      "- Diagrams illustrating hearing loss types including conductive and mixed hearing loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Images showing bone conduction device placement and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Graphics detailing candidacy criteria for bone conduction hearing devices and middle ear implants.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "For patients with conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage but preserved cochlear and auditory nerve function, non-implant hearing rehabilitation encompasses primarily bone conduction devices and middle ear implants as effective options. Bone conduction devices (both percutaneous and transcutaneous types) are widely used and demonstrate significant audiological benefit and improved quality of life. Middle ear implants offer a surgical alternative that also improves hearing in suitable candidates and may particularly benefit mixed hearing loss cases. Device selection depends on auditory thresholds, middle ear status, patient preference, and risk profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilateral fitting of bone conduction devices enhances sound localization and binaural hearing benefits. Transcutaneous bone conduction devices reduce skin-related complications compared to percutaneous devices, though both improve hearing markedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prognosis with non-implant rehabilitation is generally favorable when cochlear integrity is confirmed, and appropriate device candidacy criteria are applied. Multidisciplinary assessment and tailored rehabilitation planning are essential for optimizing functional outcomes.\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cochlear implant (CI) candidacy now encompasses patients with complex histories including prior tympanoplasties and cholesteatoma, provided the cochlea and auditory nerve remain intact and the middle ear is disease-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prior middle ear surgeries and ossicular chain disruption modify surgical planning, often necessitating staged implantation, subtotal petrosectomy, and obliteration techniques to mitigate infection and implant extrusion risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cochlear implantation can be safely performed simultaneous with cholesteatoma removal in limited disease; however, extensive or recurrent disease requires staged procedures with confirmed eradication prior to implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Electrode insertion in ears post-tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma may require insertion via cochleostomy due to round window ossification or fibrosis; stable fixation of the electrode and obliteration of mastoid cavities ensure implant stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Non-implant hearing rehabilitation such as bone conduction devices (BCDs) and middle ear implants (MEIs) offer alternative or adjunctive options for conductive hearing loss due to ossicular damage with preserved cochlear function.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Multidisciplinary evaluation integrating audiological data, imaging, surgical risk, and patient-specific anatomy is imperative for optimal candidacy determination and rehabilitation planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Cochlear implantation represents a transformative intervention for patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss who derive limited benefit from conventional amplification. However, the presence of prior middle ear pathology, including multiple tympanoplasties and cholesteatoma, complicates both candidacy assessment and surgical strategy due to altered anatomy, risk of residual disease, and infection possibility. Though the cochlea and auditory nerve are often preserved in this population, conductive components and ossicular integrity are frequently compromised. This report synthesizes current evidence, clinical guidelines, and surgical considerations to elucidate candidacy criteria, procedural adaptations, risk mitigation strategies, and alternative hearing rehabilitation modalities pertinent to this complex cohort. The objective is to provide a comprehensive knowledge framework facilitating informed clinical decision-making and optimizing patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Detailed Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Cochlear Implant Candidacy in Post-Tympanoplasty and Cholesteatoma Patients\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1.1 General Candidacy Parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "Contemporary cochlear implant candidacy has evolved beyond stringent traditional thresholds to include a broader spectrum of hearing loss profiles. Specific to this cohort:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Audiologic Criteria:** Candidates typically present with severe-to-profound hearing loss; however, the presence of conductive or mixed losses necessitates precise differentiation. For referral consideration, a pure tone average (PTA) ≥ 60 dB HL and speech recognition scores ≤ 50-60% (CNC or AzBio) in the target ear are recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Anatomical Integrity:** High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial for exclusion of active middle ear pathology, assessment of cochlear patency, and confirmation of auditory nerve integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Middle Ear Status:** The ear must be dry and free of infection; active cholesteatoma or residual disease contraindicates immediate implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multidisciplinary Evaluation:** Audiologists, surgeons, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists collaborate to weigh benefits, risks, and patient-specific factors such as duration of deafness, cognitive status, and social support.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1.2 Impact of Prior Surgeries and Ossicular Damage\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ossicular chain disruption leads to conductive or mixed hearing loss but is not an absolute contraindication if the cochlear nerve remains functional.\n",
      "\n",

      "#### 2.1 Timing and Staging Strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Simultaneous Surgery**: Suitable in cases of limited cholesteatoma with intact capsule, employing laser vaporization to ablate residual epithelium and reduce recurrence risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Staged Surgery**: Preferred when disease is extensive or capsule integrity is lost. A first stage involves cholesteatoma removal and cavity obliteration; cochlear implantation follows after confirming disease eradication.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Subtotal Petrosectomy**: This approach obliterates middle ear and mastoid cavities with fat or bone pate, disconnecting the space from the external environment to minimize infection and extrusion risk, especially in radical cavity cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.2 Electrode Insertion Techniques\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Round Window Insertion**: Optimal when patent; however, frequently compromised by fibrosis or ossification post-infection or prior surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cochleostomy**: Employed if the round window is not accessible, requiring precise anatomical navigation due to altered middle ear structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Array Fixation and Stabilization**: Critical due to altered cavity morphology; fixation near the surface reduces risk of extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.3 Risk Mitigation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Infection Control**: Perioperative antibiotics and obliteration reduce implant-related infection risk, skin flap breakdown, and meningitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monitoring for Residual/Recurrent Disease**: Regular postoperative imaging and clinical examinations are imperative.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Literature Review & Theoretical Framework\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature, including recent clinical guidelines from the American Cochlear Implant Alliance and otolaryngology expert consensus, converges on expanded CI candidacy criteria that emphasize individualized assessment rather than rigid audiometric cutoffs. Middle ear pathology, including cholesteatoma and prior tympanoplasties, historically represented contraindications, but emerging evidence supports safe implantation under strict disease-free conditions. Surgical techniques have adapted to the altered anatomy, reflecting evolving understanding of disease management, implant mechanics, and infection control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology & Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Data synthesis involves appraisal of cohort studies, retrospective analyses, surgical series, and case reports to compare outcomes between early and staged implantation, obliterative vs. non-obliterative tympanoplasty, and alternative hearing devices for conductive losses. Imaging modalities serve as diagnostic cornerstones. Outcomes are assessed by standardized speech recognition tests and quality of life surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "While cochlear implantation in this population achieves generally favorable outcomes, risks of residual cholesteatoma and infection necessitate meticulous surgical planning and vigilant postoperative surveillance. Obliteration techniques, although more technically demanding, reduce long-term complications. Alternative devices offer rehabilitation for patients not suited or electing not to undergo implantation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include heterogeneous reporting of outcomes, small case numbers in complex surgical subgroups, and variable follow-up durations. Longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials remain needed to further refine intervention algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Future Research Directions\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prospective multi-institutional registries assessing long-term outcomes and complications in cholesteatoma-treated ears receiving CI.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comparative effectiveness of simultaneous vs. staged cochlear implantation relative to disease extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Innovations in electrode design and fixation tailored to obliterated mastoid anatomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Expanded trials on middle ear implants and bone conduction devices in complex ossicular disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Improved imaging protocols for early detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma post-implantation.\n",
