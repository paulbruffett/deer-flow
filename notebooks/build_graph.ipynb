cloud computing market size is projected to grow from USD 766 billion in 2024 to USD 3,500 billion by 2035, representing a CAGR of 14.623%, during the forecast period 2024-2035.\\n\\n![Image 3: Cloud Computing Market by Type of Deployment](https://www.rootsanalysis.com/img003/cloud-computing-market-by-type-of-deployment-model-I.webp)\\n\\nTo learn more about this report, [request a free sample copy](https://www.rootsanalysis.com/reports/cloud-computing-market/request-sample.html)\\n\\nThe new research study consists of industry trends, detailed market analysis, key market trends of the cloud computing market, SWOT analysis and value chain analysis.\\n\\n The cloud computing market is a dynamic and rapidly evolving sector that revolutionizes traditional IT infrastructure through the integration of cutting-edge technologies. This market is instrumental in enhancing operations, efficiency, and economies across diverse commercial enterprises. It encompasses a wide range of cloud solutions, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), all aimed at improving efficacy and scalability while ensuring data security and accessibility. The high demand for flexible and cost-effective IT solutions has led to a shift from conventional on-premises systems to cloud-based services, enhancing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. This shift reduces the need for extensive physical hardware and maintenance, allowing businesses to scale operations dynamically. Furthermore, the increasing demand for data-driven insights and high-quality digital services drives companies to adopt cloud computing solutions, which help maintain operational consistency and regulatory compliance.\\n\\nSeveral companies are investing in the cloud computing market bringing in several opportunities, for instance, in October 2023, [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/features/microsoft-announces-a5-billion-investment-in-computing-capacity-and-capability-to-help-australia-seize-the-ai-era/) announced an A$5 billion investment in computing capacity and capability to help Australia seize the AI era. However, the increasing cost of cloud services and potential security vulnerabilities pose challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

This industry plays a crucial role in improving operations, efficiency, and financial performance for various business sectors. It includes a broad array of cloud offerings, such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), all designed to enhance effectiveness and scalability while ensuring data protection and accessibility.\\n\\nThe growing need for adaptable and economical IT solutions has prompted a transition from conventional on-site systems to cloud-based services, boosting efficiency and reducing operational expenses. This transition reduces the necessity for substantial physical hardware and upkeep, enabling companies to adjust their operations flexibly. Additionally, the rising demand for data-driven insights and high-quality digital services encourages organizations to embrace cloud computing solutions, which aid in maintaining operational consistency and compliance with regulations.\\n\\nVarious firms are investing into the cloud computing sector, creating numerous opportunities; for example, in October 2023, Microsoft revealed a A$5 billion investment in computing capacity and capability to aid Australia in harnessing the AI era. However, the escalating costs of cloud services and potential security risks present challenges, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Despite these obstacles, the market is experiencing remarkable growth due to opportunities for innovation and the emergence of advanced technologies, including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nThese advancements provide further opportunities for predictive analytics, improved security measures, and better decision-making abilities, suggesting that the global cloud computing market would grow at a healthy pace during the forecast period.\\n\\nStory Continues\\n\\n![Image 5](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pHSLMf2TuvduasQfbAbYiA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQ3MjtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/c0f3a82118ff09837d7c971c0fa3f9f9)\\n\\n**CLOUD COMPUTING MARKET: KEY SEGMENTS**\\n\\n**Market Share by Type of Deployment Model**\\n\\nBased on the type of deployment model, the global cloud computing market is segmented into public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud deployment models. Currently, public cloud segment captures the majority share of the market. Businesses can take advantage of lower infrastructure expenses and the capability to swiftly adjust resources according to demand, making it appealing for organizations of all sizes.\\n\\nMoreover, the widespread usage of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings further accelerates the expansion of the public cloud sector. However, hybrid cloud segment is anticipated to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period.\\n\\n**Market Share by Type of Service Model**\\n\\nBased on the type of service model, the cloud computing market is segmented into service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Currently, software as a service (SaaS) segment captures the majority share of the market. This can be attributed to its widespread use across different sectors, offering cost-effectiveness, scalability, and easy access.

A lot of industries dealing with private information in healthcare, banking, and government tend to hesitate to use cloud solutions because of the risks. Dealing with regulations in various regions and the fear that their data might not be kept safe leads to more uncertainty about adopting the cloud.\\n\\nDue to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, some cloud providers still have difficulties managing and protecting data according to every required standard in every country. Because of these concerns, businesses are reluctant, which slows down the progress and popularity of cloud services. There are also restrictions in many countries that control where and how data can be stored or moved, which impacts the operations of cloud service providers managing data from various places. Security measures such as encryption, identity management, and threat detection are constantly being strengthened in the cloud industry to manage security concerns.\\n\\n### **_Integration of AI and machine learning with cloud platforms enables advanced analytics capabilities._**\\n\\nCombining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with cloud platforms represents an important opportunity in the Cloud Computing Market. By working together, businesses now use advanced analytics and automation to convert huge amounts of data into useful information. Such cloud-based solutions are the reason complex AI and ML can work without the high initial purchase of hardware. As a consequence, companies can quicken their innovative efforts, enhance how they make managerial choices, and perform better when it comes to operations across healthcare, finance, and retail.\\n\\nIn the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) report, it was revealed that AI in cloud services has increased by 45% over the last three years, revealing a strong desire to use these technologies together. Cloud platforms supplying AI-powered analytics as a service are a major reason for the market’s growth, reaching small as well as large enterprises. Because of this trend, more customers want a personal customer experience, automated maintenance, and advanced cybersecurity tools, all based in the Cloud Computing Market.\\n\\n### **_Expansion of edge computing enhances real-time processing and reduces latency in cloud services._**\\n\\nThe rise of edge computing in the Cloud Computing Market can make real-time processing faster and help cut down cloud service delays.

This vast market opportunity remains largely untapped as various market players strive to build their capacity. The US market leads the race, as observed in the country’s predominant share in existing hyperscale data center capacity and the project pipeline. The industry’s strong demand drivers are unlikely to moderate any time soon, even with temporary challenges in the macro economy or global trade fluctuations. Some of these points are discussed in this chapter, covering the market size estimates and the major demand drivers.\\n\\nIndustry Size\\n-------------\\n\\nEstimates of the size of the global data center market vary due to differing assumptions and related parameters. However, all align on the sector’s trajectory, involving significant growth in the medium term and a few regions dominating the space. Global data center size (by revenue) is estimated to be $125.4 Bn in 2024, which is forecast to grow at an 11.3% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to $364.6 Bn by 2034, largely driven by the continuation of the global megatrend of digitalisation (Precedence Research, 2024).\\n\\nContinued adoption of cloud computing by enterprises globally will be a key driver in the hyperscale market, as businesses continue to move away from on-site enterprise models to flexible and scalable IT solutions. Digital transformation, namely AI-based solutions and big data analytics will continue to demand significant computing power, particularly as machine learning improves and evolves. An expansion of the edge data center market is also expected, as the IoT universe expands, and consumers demand lower latency and improved real-time data processing through their devices.\\n\\nSource: Precedence Research\\n\\nThe optimistic outlook for the global data center market is a testament to its essential role in enabling the modern digital world. It supports the seamless operation of digital services, from cloud computing to online transactions, and plays a crucial role in the roll-out of transformative technological advancements, such as AI.\\n\\nNorth America, being the largest market by revenue, plays a pivotal role in the global data center landscape. The US market has seen a significant surge in data center capacity, driven by the proliferation of cloud service providers, the rise of the IoT, and advancements in AI technologies. Between the second half of 2020 and the second half of 2023, the data center capacity under construction in the US increased nearly ninefold, from 611.0MW to 5,341.0MW (JLL, 2024). The Northern Virginia region, in particular, has become a focal point, with a data center vacancy rate of less than 1.0% in 2023, reflecting the rampant demand for data center capacity (Statista, 2024) (Statista, 2024). The region’s popularity is driven by its strategic location near major internet exchange points, access to a highly educated workforce, favourable business climate with tax incentives, ample land and reliable power availability. Additionally, proximity to federal government agencies and the growing demand for secure, low-latency data services further improve its appeal as a data center hub.\\n\\nThis rapid expansion in the North American region is also supported by the high penetration of 5G technology and the widespread adoption of digital services. The US leads in 5G mobile connections, expected to rise from 15.0% in 2021 to 68.0% by 2025, driving significant data usage and, consequently, the growing need for data centers.\\n\\nThe European data center market, following closely behind North America, has also seen significant growth over recent years. The FLAPD regional markets—Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin—remain central hubs due to their excellent connectivity, infrastructure and strategically important locations, despite headwinds in the form of declining land availability and, correspondingly, increasing land cost. This has expedited the emergence of secondary data center locations, such as Berlin, Milan, and Madrid, which are increasingly being seen as a viable alternative due to cost, speed of development and connectivity.\\n\\nNote: Regional share is based on market size by revenue of 2023. \\n\\nSource: Precedence Research\\n\\nIn particular, the European market has led the way in the decarbonisation of data centers, an increasing focus of governments and organisations as the world grapples with the challenge presented by climate change. This has largely been EU-led, with the Energy Efficiency Directive (“EED”), which was implemented in 2023 and aims to reduce Europe’s energy consumption by 11.7% by 2030, supporting the EU Green Deal’s objective of cutting carbon emissions by 55.0% by the same year. Under the EED, data centers within the EU that exceed 500kW will be required to report their energy use and emissions as a first step, which encompasses floor area, installed power, data volumes, energy consumption, PUE, temperature set points, waste heat utilisation, water usage, and use of renewable energy.\\n\\nAmidst competition and rising regulatory requirements, developers and investors are progressively shifting attention to the Asia- Pacific (APAC) region. Its currently lagging position in the global data center market share is compensated by exponential growth. In terms of installed capacity, the APAC region is anticipated to reach more than double the existing levels within the next 3-4 years (Aurex, 2025). Collectively, the region’s emerging market economies and their public/private digitalisation projects, innovation hubs, and 5G rollouts are shaping the market contours.\\n\\nLatin America, the Middle East, and Africa hold the residual market share. This is largely driven by Latin America, which has benefitted from strong economic growth, rapid adoption of digitalisation trends, and favourable policies promoting digital economies and innovation hubs, particularly in Brazil, Mexico, and Chile.\\n\\nWithin regions, primary markets, characterized as those with at least 600MW of supply, continue to see robust growth as colocation and hyperscale providers consolidate their positions in key metros due to their connectivity and advanced infrastructure. However, secondary markets, with 100-600MW of supply, have gained attention from investors, developers, and lenders seeking new opportunities in less crowded markets where land can be more readily available, and cheaper.\\n\\nSome key industry dynamics outline the changing landscape of the data center market. One of them refers to hyperscale data centers, which are mostly associated with the top and well-entrenched players in the cloud services market. Hyperscale data centers, particularly in the US, dominate the global capacity, followed by significant contributions from Europe and China.\\n\\nAccording to the first chart, the US holds 51.0% of the hyperscale data center capacity, reflecting its leading position in the market. Colocation markets are expanding in both primary and secondary regions, reflecting the growing demand for flexible and scalable data center solutions. These trends collectively indicate a transformative period for the data center industry, characterized by a shift towards more efficient, scalable, and strategically located facilities that meet the evolving needs of the digital economy.\\n\\nNote: Data is as of Q4 2023.\\n\\nSource: SDx Central\\n\\n![Image 4](https://panamericanfinance.com/wp-content/themes/yootheme/cache/7c/Global-Data-Center-Colocation-Market-scaled-7c1236ab.jpeg)\\n\\nData Centers Market by Type\\n---------------------------\\n\\nGlobal data center dynamics continue to evolve due to technological innovations, regulatory changes, and growing consumer demands, all of which are impacting the type, size and number of data centers required to support an increasingly digitalised world.\\n\\nThe changing composition of the global data center market is most stark when analysing the historical and forecast decline in enterprise data center capacity, which totalled 58.3% in 2017 but just 40.3% in 2022 and is expected to decline further to 28.1% by 2027. This is primarily a result of the roll-out of hyperscale data centers, driving both absolute growth in the data center market and, therefore, a declining share of enterprise data centers, but also a reduction in enterprise data centers that they have replaced, as companies continue to opt for scalable, affordable cloud solutions.\\n\\nResultingly, hyperscale data centers are expected to account for over 50.0% of global data center capacity by 2027, up from 20.1% in 2017 and reflecting a 9.6% CAGR (can we show a CAGR of market share?). Worldwide, the capacity of hyperscale data centers has doubled since 2020, and further expansion is forecast, with over 440 hyperscale data centers in the pipeline as of April 2024 (DCD, 2024). This trend is fuelled by the growing cloud adoption detailed above, but also the rise in AI, the rollout of 5G, big data analytics and crypto mining, all of which require significant computing power, storage capacity and advanced security systems provided by Hyperscalers.\\n\\nSource: Synergy Group\\n\\nDespite the decline in relative importance, on- premise data centers still play a vital role in the digital infrastructure landscape. Enterprises continue to invest in on-premise facilities to support hybrid cloud strategies that combine internal IT resources with third-party cloud infrastructure. Factors such as resiliency, cost economics, and existing investments influence the decision to maintain or expand on-premise data centers.\\n\\nColocation data centers have also grown substantially from about 6.0GW in 2019 to over 19GW by 2023, albeit dwarfed by that of the hyperscalers but reflecting a forecast increase in absolute terms (Citi Research, 2024). Many enterprises that previously operated on-premise data centers are now opting for colocation services to leverage cost efficiencies, scalability and the advanced infrastructure offered by colocation providers, supported by a Uptime Institute survey, which revealed that 79.0% of colocation providers reported growth in demand for colocation capacity in 2023 (Data Center Frontier, 2024).\\n\\nHowever, colocation facilities have also been impacted by hyperscale expansion. Previously considered a more dynamic, cost-effective and scalable solution to enterprise data centers, some inherent disadvantages of colocation facilities are driving consumers to go one step further and transition to a full-scope cloud service provision. Increased scalability, pay-as- you-go models, geographical reach, technology integration and reduced maintenance expenses offered by hyperscale cloud service providers can deliver both cost and operational efficiencies to consumers that are otherwise difficult to achieve through a more centralised IT solution.\\n\\nThe global colocation data center market was valued at approximately $66.3 Bn in 2023 and is projected to reach around $221.9 Bn by 2032 (Expert Market Research, 2023) (GlobeNewswire, 2023). Meanwhile, the global hyperscale data center market was valued at $37.1 Bn in 2023 and is anticipated to grow from $44.9 Bn in 2024 to $262.1 Bn by 2032, with a higher CAGR of 24.7%, indicating stronger growth potential (Fortune Business Insights, 2024).\\n\\nIn conclusion, the data center market is experiencing robust growth driven by the shift towards hyperscale and colocation facilities, technological advancements, and the increasing need for scalable, efficient, and sustainable data storage solutions. The evolving landscape presents numerous opportunities for investors, developers, and businesses to capitalize on the expanding demand for digital infrastructure.\\n\\nRise of AI-driven Solutions\\n---------------------------\\n\\nArtificial intelligence is a major force behind the increasing demand for data centers, given the significant infrastructure required to support its computational power and data storage needs. Whilst the AI industry is still in its nascent stages, it has developed rapidly, growing from $95.6 Bn in 2021 to $214.0 Bn in 2024 transforming industries and enhancing operations, with 42.0% of enterprise-scale organisations now having AI solutions integrated into their business models according to multinational IT company, IBM (Acropolium, 2024) (NMSC, 2024) (Forbes Media, 2024).\\n\\nAI’s success is largely driven by its diverse use cases, spanning nearly every industry. These transform processes, enhance efficiency and decision-making, improve customer experiences, drive automation, and enhance security. The impact of these has been so profound that companies not adopting AI solutions are increasingly finding themselves at risk of being rendered obsolete and irrelevant.\\n\\nFor example, Estée Lauder, a global cosmetics company, released a voice-enabled makeup assistant designed to assist visually impaired people with applying makeup, enhancing their customer experience and, resultingly, its global brand. Meanwhile, companies such as Pentagon Credit Union (PenFed) are using chatbots and conversational AI to help customers get answers to common questions faster, reducing the load on customer service reps and improving employee satisfaction (CIO, 2023).\\n\\nAt General Electric (“GE”), AI is leveraged regularly for predictive maintenance purposes, analysing data directly from aircraft engines to identify problems and required maintenance. Rolls-Royce has also found use for AI in identifying predictive maintenance, improving the efficiency of jet engines and reducing the amount of carbon planes produce, while also streamlining maintenance schedules through predictive analytics (CIO, 2023).\\n\\nWhilst these examples highlight some of the flagship AI solutions being implemented by multinational organisations, the democratised nature of AI enables small, medium and large enterprises to implement AI-based products, helping to streamline everyday business functions, including accounting, marketing, process automation and recruitment.\\n\\nIn addition to existing use cases, several emerging trends are creating new pockets of computing workloads driven by AI, including autonomous vehicles, which rely on real-time data processing for navigation and safety, personalised medicine, creating tailored treatment plans for patients, and deepfake technology, which allows for the creation of realistic visual effects and character animations by synthesising faces and voices.\\n\\nThese emerging AI-based applications can capture demand almost overnight, leading to unexpected spikes in computing capacity requirements. Most notably, ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI, is estimated to have reached 100 Mn monthly active users in January 2023, just two months after its launch (Reuters, 2023).\\n\\nThe speed of deployment, extensive use cases and rapid evolution and uptake of AI solutions mean that demand for computer processing power, data storage and connectivity is growing at an unprecedented rate and underscores the crucial role that data centers continue to play in the global digital infrastructure landscape. Resultingly, global AI infrastructure spend —including data centers, networks, and other hardware that supports the use of AI applications—is expected to reach $422.6 Bn by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 44.0% over a six-year period. (WSJ, 2023).\\n\\nAs AI continues to evolve, advance, and integrate into various aspects of our daily lives, the supply of data centers capable of supporting these computationally intensive applications will need to follow suit. This will highlight the interdependent relationship between AI development and the expansion of the data center market and reaffirm data centers’ position as essential infrastructure in the era of digitalisation.\\n\\n![Image 5](https://panamericanfinance.com/wp-content/themes/yootheme/cache/4d/The-Application-of-AI-across-Business-Enterprises-scaled-4df97140.jpeg)\\n\\n5G Networks\\n-----------\\n\\nThe global growth of 5G technology has been transformative, reshaping industries and enabling innovative applications by offering substantially faster data speeds, reduced latency, and enhanced connectivity. This makes it a catalyst for the continued rollout and evolution of data centers, reshaping their architecture, operations, and role in the digital ecosystem.\\n\\nIn particular, 5G technology has had a profound effect on the demand for edge computing. 5G networks utilise a more decentralised architecture, which distributes computing and data processing closer to the edge of the network, reducing the load on centralised servers and enhancing the ability to handle numerous connections simultaneously. This trend requires the establishment of smaller, localised edge data centers, which can handle the data processing requirements without impacting the user experience through higher latency.\\n\\nHowever, it is not just reduced latency that is driving data center deployment through the rollout of 5G. The high volume of data generated by 5G applications necessitates significant storage and processing capacity as well. 5G enables a substantial increase in the number of connected devices at any given time, having been specifically designed to support large-scale IoT deployments, allowing up to 1 Mn devices per square kilometre. This results in significantly more data being generated, necessitating robust processing and storage solutions in the form of data centers, meaning businesses must invest in scalable storage solutions to accommodate both short-term and long-term data retention, whilst ensuring accessibility and compliance.\\n\\nWhilst 5G networks have already been rolled out globally, its growth story is far from over. According to Ericsson’s mobility report, approximately 50.0% of the world is now covered by 5G networks, marking a significant milestone in global connectivity, but also highlighting some notable regional disparities. Whilst North America, Europe, India and China each have achieved significant market penetration of between 70.0% and 95.0%, Latin America, Middle East and Africa and APAC have achieved 20.0% or less, representing a significant scope of 5G expansion and underpinning the need for infrastructure across these less developed markets (Ericsson, 2024).\\n\\nThe global 5G infrastructure market, projected to reach $517.2 Bn by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% from 2021 to 2030, underscores this potential increase in demand for enhanced data center capacity (Allied Market Research, 2021). Furthermore, by the end of 2023, it is expected that 1.5 Bn devices will be connected to 5G networks worldwide, necessitating robust data center infrastructure to manage the surge in high-speed data traffic (GSMA, 2024).\\n\\nThis adoption of 5G technology is positioned to significantly boost the data center networking market, which is projected to reach a revenue of $38.3 Bn by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% (Data Centre Magazine, 2024). This growth is fuelled by 5G’s capabilities, including low latency, high-speed connectivity, and large bandwidth, which improve operational efficiency within data centers (Data Centre Magazine, 2024). Following the development of this technology, it is projected to contribute almost $900.0 Bn to the global economy by 2030, significantly impacting the manufacturing, service, and ICT sectors (GSMA, 2024).\\n\\nSource: Ericsson Mobility Report 2024\\n\\nAdditionally, in 31 of the 39 markets analysed in a GSMA Intelligence report, the median price per gigabyte for 5G plans is lower than that for non-5G plans, with most having a 5G unit price that is less than half of 4G (GSMA, 2024). This affordability is likely to accelerate 5G adoption, further increasing the demand for data center services. This article also mentioned that 123 operators in 62 markets worldwide had launched 5G fixed wireless access (FWA) services by the end of 2023, indicating significant growth potential (GSMA, 2024).\\n\\nAnother growth indicator is that approximately 64.0% of enterprises plan to deploy private 5G networks by the end of 2024 to leverage the enhanced security and performance for critical applications (GSMA, 2024). This trend highlights the importance of 5G in enterprise environments, where data centers play a crucial role in supporting these private networks.\\n\\nMoreover, 5G networks are expected to be up to 90.0% more energy-efficient per unit of traffic compared to 4G networks, contributing to overall sustainability goals in telecommunications (Nokia, 2020). This energy efficiency is vital as the industry strives to reduce its carbon footprint while expanding its infrastructure to meet growing data demands.\\n\\nCloud Computing\\n---------------\\n\\nAdditionally, another key driver of the data center market is the development of cloud computing, which requires a significant amount of computing power to operate and is gaining importance across sectors. There is a clear trend towards adopting this technology to make operations more efficient, as reflected in the McKinsey Global Survey of 2022, where 90.0% of respondents confirmed pursuing at least one large-scale digital transformation in the past two years (McKinsey, 2022).\\n\\nAnother indicator of the growth of this technology adoption is provided by Gartner’s estimates on global IT spending. By the end of 2024, over $5 Tn was spent globally across various segments of the technology sector, marking a 9% year-on-year growth (Gartner, 2025). Importantly, the data center segment had the highest annual rise in spending at 35%. The estimates are indicative of the accelerated capex cycle in the overall digital infrastructure space.\\n\\nThe transition to a cloud computing environment is a central part of the digital transformation initiatives. Cloud computing’s advantage relative to in-house IT systems is driving exponential growth in its adoption. Spending with the three largest cloud companies (Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet) rose by 337.0% in the five years up to 2023 (BCG, 2024). The tight relationship between cloud computing and data centers is clear as the same leading cloud service providers are also some of those with the maximum footprint in the global data center market through their hyperscale infrastructure.\\n\\nSource: Gartner (press releases of 2024 and 2025)\\n\\nDue to the importance of this technology in creating efficiencies within businesses, there is a rapid and steady growth in its adoption. In 2023, global end-user spending on public cloud services stood at $563.6 Bn. Gartner’s projections point to a 20.4% growth in global spending by the end of 2024 (Gartner, 2023). The cloud computing industry is divided into different segments focusing on various ways to provide its services. All these segments are experiencing a buoyant growth outlook, but the infrastructure- as-a-service (IaaS) is the most prominent, followed by the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) segment. Additionally, an important trend is the rise of industry cloud platforms—a combined whole-product offering including IaaS, PaaS, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) services. Such platforms address specific industry requirements and are gaining popularity in the market.\\n\\nMoreover, cloud services have a bilateral relationship with other technologies and trends such as AI and machine learning technologies, where their development is tied to each other’s performance. The infrastructure must adapt to meet the demand. Most companies use the cloud for training and running large AI applications. Cloud service providers must align the computing infrastructure and facility to address the AI boom. Most of the existing cloud infrastructure may not be fully ready to cater to this demand, especially for generative AI (GenAI) applications. This is because they were originally meant as an alternate solution to on-premise infrastructure (WSJ, 2023). Hence, there will still be an increased demand for the development of cloud computing services, which may lead to the need for further data center capacities.\\n\\nTo keep things in perspective, it should also be pointed out that the rise of public cloud adoption does not necessarily mean an end to on-premise data centers/infrastructure by companies. As of the end of 2022, expenditure on such data centers crossed $100.0 Bn (The Economist, 2023). Some characteristics about it are still regarded in the market. For example, industries find on-premise facilities advantageous for their increasingly connected factories and products. On the other hand, the public cloud has downsides in some applications. One of them is regarding the required data transfer, which, when needed, almost instantaneously becomes a constraint for centralized data centers.\\n\\nNotable cases of critical real-time data requirements are in industrial automation, where digital twins of factories and related product developments need constant and real-time data analysis. For this matter, industrial/manufacturing companies such as Volkswagen (German automotive), Caterpillar (US-based earth-moving equipment), and Fanuc (Japanese industrial robot manufacturer) are notable examples of entities devoting resources to on-premise data centers while hiving off the less sensitive parts to hyperscale cloud service providers.\\n\\nThe surge in hybrid cloud strategies is also noteworthy, with companies opting for a combination of public and private clouds to optimize performance, security, and cost. This hybrid approach allows businesses to maintain sensitive operations in private clouds or on- premise data centers while leveraging the scalability and flexibility of public clouds for less critical workloads.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cloud computing is a pivotal driver of the data center market, pushing forward the development of all types of data centers— on-premise, colocation, and hyperscale. The continuous evolution of cloud technologies, coupled with their integration with AI and other advanced technologies, ensures sustained growth and expansion in data center capacities worldwide. As businesses increasingly rely on cloud computing to enhance efficiency and drive innovation, the demand for robust, scalable, and efficient data centers will continue to rise, solidifying their role as critical infrastructure in the modern digital economy.\\n\\nEdge Computing\\n--------------\\n\\nBuilding on the momentum of cloud computing, edge computing is emerging as another key driver of the data center market. The global edge computing market, valued at $10.1 Bn in 2022, is projected to reach $140.0 Bn by 2030, reflecting a significant CAGR of 38.8% (Polaris Market Research, 2022). This surge is fuelled by the need for real-time data processing and reduced latency, crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation. By 2025, it is estimated that 75.0% of enterprise- generated data will be created and processed at the edge, outside of traditional centralized data centers (Gartner, 2018).\\n\\nThe proliferation of IoT devices, expected to reach close to 30.0 Bn by 2030, further underscores the importance of edge data centers in managing the massive influx of data (Statista, 2024). The synergy between 5G and edge computing enhances the performance of edge applications and services, providing high-speed, low-latency connectivity essential for modern digital infrastructure (STL Partners, n.d.).\\n\\nEdge computing not only optimizes bandwidth usage and reduces data transmission costs but also improves security and compliance by processing data locally. This local processing power is particularly beneficial for sectors such as healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and telecommunications, which are rapidly adopting edge computing and data center technologies to enhance operational efficiency and deliver better customer experiences (Forbes, 2024).\\n\\nFurthermore, edge computing offers scalable solutions that can be expanded as the volume of data and the number of connected devices grows, providing significant cost savings and advanced analytics capabilities (McKinsey, 2024). It also extends the reach of digital services to remote and rural areas, offering local processing where traditional data centers are not feasible.\\n\\nIn response to these benefits, demand for edge data centers continues to grow. According to a 2023 survey conducted by DCD, the most compelling factor for deploying edge data centers is the low latency and high bandwidth they provide, cited by 41.0% of respondents. This is closely followed by concerns over data security and privacy, which 38.3% of respondents identified as critical, highlighting the importance of secure data handling at the edge. Other factors, accounting for 20.7%, also contribute to the increasing need for edge data centers, reflecting the diverse benefits that these facilities offer in enhancing overall data center performance (JLL, 2024).\\n\\nOverall, the integration of edge computing with existing data center infrastructure is driving the market forward, enabling real-time data processing, enhancing efficiency, and supporting the growing demand for digital services. This trend is solidifying the role of data centers as critical infrastructure in the global digital environment.\\n\\nSource: JLL\\n\\nCrypto Mining\\n-------------\\n\\nFollowing the discussion, crypto mining, which is the CPU-intensive process of creating new crypto tokens like Bitcoin, is gaining an important role as a demand driver for data centers. The intensiveness of computer power required for this process results in significantly higher investments in data centers and data center hardware compared to other businesses outside this industry. Furthermore, the mining process necessary for the upkeep of most major cryptocurrencies demands more investment in computing power. To respond to this high demand, a common solution is turning to hyperscale server farms in the data center market. In addition, crypto miners typically need to lease or own at least 1.0MW to 5.0MW of data center power to mine effectively (Datafloq, 2022).\\n\\nAs a result of these requirements, there is an increasing number of dedicated data centers in the pipeline for crypto mining around the globe. The particularities and power capacities of each vary by project, but there is a clear impact of the crypto mining industry on the data center market.\\n\\n#### **Dedicated Data Centers in Pipeline for Crypto Mining**\\n\\n|  | **Location** | **Particulars** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) | South Carolina, US | Three new data centers are to be connected to renewable energy sources |\\n| Bit Origin | Wyoming, US | Securities purchase agreement in December 2023 for a 25.0MW crypto data center |\\n| Bitdeer Technologies | Norway | Construction is underway for a 175.0MW data center for targeted completion by mid-2025 |\\n| Ethiopia Investment Holdings | Ethiopia | The government’s strategic investment arm signed a $250.0MW MOU for data center infrastructure to support crypto surge |\\n\\nSource: Data Centre Magazine, Digital Infra Network, Bitdeer, and Reuters\\n\\nThe global cryptocurrency mining market is facing a CAGR of around 12.2% between 2023 and 2032, reaching a total revenue of $8.3 Bn by the end of 2032. The attached chart from Expert Market Research illustrates this projected growth trajectory, starting at $2.9 Bn in 2023 and rising steadily each year. The market size for 2024 is estimated at $3.3 Bn, followed by $3.7 Bn in 2025, and continuing this upward trend through the decade. This growth reflects the escalating investment and expansion in crypto mining operations, driving further demand for data center capacities globally.\\n\\nAnother critical factor is crypto mining’s energy consumption. Bitcoin mining alone consumes approximately 110.0TWh per year, similar to the energy consumption of some entire countries, such as Malaysia or Sweden. This substantial energy requirement is leading to innovations in data center energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources to power these operations (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, 2023).\\n\\nOverall, the cryptocurrency market is driving further demand for data center capacities around the globe, and there is an expectation for incremental growth in the sector. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance and their underlying blockchain technology evolves, the demand for specialized data centers equipped to handle the unique requirements of crypto mining will likely continue to rise, solidifying this industry as a crucial driver of data center market growth.\\n\\nSource: Expert Market Research\\n\\n[Introduction to Data Centers](https://panamericanfinance.com/insights/energy-transition/global-datacenter-market-report-2025/introduction-to-data-centers-gdmr2025/)\\n\\n[Global Data Center Market Report](https://panamericanfinance.com/insights/energy-transition/global-datacenter-market-report-2025/)\\n\\n[Emerging Trends](https://panamericanfinance.com/insights/energy-transition/global-datacenter-market-report-2025/emerging-trends-gdmr2025/)\\n\\n###### Miami Office\\n\\n2601 South Bayshore Drive, \\n\\nSuite 1130 \\n\\nMiami, Florida 33133\\n\\n[+1 (305) 577-9799](tel:+13055779799)\\n\\n[info@panamfinance.com](mailto:info@panamfinance.com)\\n\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pan-american-finance)\\n\\n###### London Office\\n\\n50 Grosvenor Hill \\n\\nLondon, UK \\n\\nW1K 3QT\\n\\n###### Menu\\n\\n*   [Firm](https://panamericanfinance.com/firm/) \\n*   [Services](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [Transactions](https://panamericanfinance.com/transactions/) \\n*   [Insights](https://panamericanfinance.com/insights/) \\n*   [Giving](https://panamericanfinance.com/giving/) \\n*   [Contact](https://panamericanfinance.com/contact/) \\n\\n###### [Our Services](https://panamericanfinance.com/transactions/)\\n\\n*   [Capital Advisory](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [M&A and Strategic Advisory](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [Project Finance and Debt Advisory](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [Capital Placement](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n\\n###### [Industry Sectors](https://panamericanfinance.com/transactions/)\\n\\n*   [Sustainable Energy](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [Climate Finance](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n*   [Sustainable Living](https://panamericanfinance.com/services/) \\n\\nCopyright © 2022 Pan American Finance, LLLP\\n\\nPAF Securities, LLC and Pan American Finance (UK), Ltd are wholly owned subsidiaries of Pan American Finance, LLLP\\n\\n(For Member’s registration information, please refer to: [FINRA’s BrokerCheck)](https://brokercheck.finra.org/search/genericsearch/firmgrid)\\n\\nPAF Securities, LLC is a member of FINRA and SIPC \\n\\nPan American Finance (UK) Ltd.

In fact, AWS market share now accounts for 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market, beating out Microsoft’s 20% and Google’s 12%. \\n\\nHowever, the cloud infrastructure services market remains highly dynamic as Microsoft and Google compete with AWS for increased cloud spending and AI dominance. This year, AWS is continuing its quest to [win 99% of the AI market](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/aws-ceo-ai-bedrock-amazon-anthropic). The strategy? “To bring millions of companies into that ecosystem while it works to improve its own AI models and chips, and increase its market share.\\n\\nIn this report, we’ll provide a detailed overview of the AWS market share, buyer landscape and trends shaping the AWS ecosystem. If your business integrates with and/or complements AWS, if you resell their products, or if you compete in similar markets, we hope you’ll find these insights valuable for informing your go-to-market decisions.\\n\\n## 2025 AWS Market Insights\\n\\nHG Insights collects data on the 2.38 million businesses buying AWS cloud services. Here are a few key takeaways from the 2024 AWS market report: \\n\\n## AWS Market Share in 2025\\n\\nAWS had the highest relative market share among the top cloud providers. AWS market share now accounts for 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market, exceeding Microsoft Azure with 20% share of the cloud market and Google Cloud Platform’s 12% share, according to Synergy Group.\\n\\n### The AWS Buyer Landscape\\n\\n![AWS buyer landscape](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_39_AM-1.png)\\n\\n![AWS buyer landscape](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_39_AM-1.png)\\n\\nThe map on the left indicates the number of AWS customers by region. More than half (**56.2%**) of AWS customers are located in North America (NA).\\n\\nHG’s data indicates rapid global expansion for AWS in the last five years: Since 2020, total customer counts have increased by a whopping **357%**.\\n\\nThis growth is likely to continue as AWS invests in new regions, points of presence (POPs), and availability zones. Some of the latest additions: \\n\\n### AWS Market Share by Company Size and Spend\\n\\n![AWS growth rate](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_41_AM-1.png)\\n\\n![AWS growth rate](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_41_AM-1.png)\\n\\nOnce again, AWS has grown its customer base across **all** company sizes – a consistent trend since 2020. From 2023 to 2024, the fastest-growing segments were SMBs and startups, both growing by nearly **28%** year-over-year.\\n\\nEven more impressive is the overall growth in these two segments over the last five years: HG’s data shows that the number of SMBs buying AWS products has grown by **165%** and startup customers have increased **257%** since 2020.\\n\\n![AWS spending](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_43_AM-1.png)\\n\\n![AWS spending](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_43_AM-1.png)\\n\\nThe vast majority (**92%**) of AWS customers are spending less than $1K per month on AWS services. This is also the fastest-growing segment, with a YoY customer count increase of **88.7%**. \\n\\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, AWS regularly adds more cloud revenue (in absolute dollar terms) than rivals. The company accounts for 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market, beating out Microsoft’s 20% and Google’s 12%.\\n\\nBut while startups remain a key priority, AWS is also targeting the world’s largest enterprises – the Forbes Global 2000 list – with their Top 2000 (T2K) initiative. The complex technical architectures at these businesses will require significant financial and time investments, and AWS plans to customize solutions on a company and industry level.\\n\\n### Key Industries Investing in AWS\\n\\n![AWS buyers by industry](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_44_AM-1.png)\\n\\n![AWS buyers by industry](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01_25-AWS-Report-Google-Drive-02-20-2025_08_44_AM-1.png)\\n\\nHG’s comprehensive usage and spend data can be segmented to understand current adoption and white space – what AWS calls *greenfield opportunities* – in key industries. Strength in certain markets is indicative of demand, and as we can see from this chart, AWS has high demand across these five key industries: Media, Internet, Manufacturing, Education, and Retail.\\n\\nThe Media and Internet sectors lead the pack with the highest total AWS buyer count, as well as the largest count of companies spending more than $100K per month.\\n\\n## Trends Shaping the AWS Ecosystem in 2025\\n\\nThe AWS ecosystem is undoubtedly influenced by what the company prioritizes internally. There are three key areas of focus for AWS we are watching going into 2025:\\n\\n### 1. Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nAWS’ investment in Gen AI extends beyond the list of Generative AI Competency Partners.\\n\\nThe company has also committed to investing $230 million in a [Generative AI Accelerator](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/6/aws-announces-230-million-commitment-for-generative-ai-startups) program, $50 million to help [public sector organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-announces-50-million-generative-ai-impact-initiative-for-public-sector-organizations/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS,become%20more%20efficient%20and%20agile.) use Gen AI, and $110 million to support [AI research at universities](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-trainium-investment-university-ai-research) using Trainium chips.\\n\\n### 2. Machine Learning\\n\\nAs with AI, AWS is ramping up investment in other emerging technology areas like Machine Learning. \\n\\nAmazon SageMaker – a service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models – launched in 2017. The next generation of the tool was announced in December 2024.\\n\\n### 3. Data Security\\n\\nEven with companies spending more than ever before on cybersecurity, data breach instances increased in 2024 and the average cost jumped by 10% YoY.\\n\\nAWS has a number of services and features focused on helping customers protect their data, such as AWS Security Hub, AWS GuardDuty, and AWS Shield, which is designed to protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\\n\\n## Read the complete report\\n\\nThe AWS Ecosystem in 2025\\n\\n[Download the Report](https://explore.hginsights.com/aws-ecosystem-in-2025?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=aws-ecosystem-in-2025&utm_medium=organic&utm_term=ug)\\n\\n## \\n\\n## About HG Insights\\n\\nHG Insights, the provider of data-driven insights to 90% of tech companies in the Fortune 100, is your go-to-market Technology Intelligence partner.\\n\\nWe deliver advanced [Revenue Growth Intelligence](https://hginsights.com/data) — on IT spend, technographics, cloud usage, intent signals, buying groups, contract details, and AI maturity — to provide global B2B companies with a better way to analyze markets and target prospects.

There are thousands of cloud providers worldwide, so it’s odd that a handful dominate the sector. To understand why they’re powerhouses, you need to know what they offer and how they plan to adapt in 2024.\\n\\n**1. Amazon Web Services**\\n--------------------------\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the biggest cloud providers. It consistently outperforms its competition year after year, [maintaining its top position](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-07-18-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-revenue-grew-30-percent-in-2022-exceeding-100-billion-for-the-first-time) in the cloud services market:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 40%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** AWS [made over $88 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/422273/yoy-quarterly-growth-aws-revenues/#:~:text=AWS%20is%20one%20of%20Amazon's,billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20in%202021.) in 2023.\\n\\nAWS offers sought-after features like a content delivery network, cloud-hosted servers and database storage. It also embraces the adoption of artificial intelligence with AI search tools, edge device support and machine learning development services.\\n\\nAWS is incredibly successful — it’s a larger profit driver than Amazon’s e-commerce service. Since it tailors itself to small businesses instead of being exclusive to large enterprises, it broadens its customer base and secures greater revenue.\\n\\n**2. Microsoft Azure**\\n----------------------\\n\\nEven though Microsoft Azure has a massive market share, it’s not even close to AWS:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 21%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Microsoft Azure [made more than $55 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/microsoft-says-azure-contributed-more-than-half-of-2023-cloud-sales) in 2023.\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure is the second biggest global cloud provider because it provides convenient and practical enterprise tools. It also offers Microsoft Defender and intelligent security, which are useful for the [57% of cloud users](https://rehack.com/cybersecurity/amazon-cloud-drive/) who feel concerned about security.\\n\\n**3. Google Cloud**\\n-------------------\\n\\nWhile Google [is leading in artificial intelligence](https://rehack.com/ai/artificial-intelligence-company-list/), search engine and consumer electronics markets, it doesn’t perform as well as AWS or Microsoft Azure in the cloud computing space:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 11%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Google Cloud [made over $26.28 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/478176/google-public-cloud-revenue/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20Google%20Cloud%20revenue,services%20running%20on%20Google%20infrastructure.) in 2022.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud has underperformed in recent years — meaning it hasn’t met stakeholders’ expectations — but it has still slowly expanded its market share. Google is a household name, so its cloud adoption rates will undoubtedly increase over time, making it one to watch in 2024.\\n\\n**4. Alibaba Cloud**\\n--------------------\\n\\nWe’re done with the three biggest cloud providers, meaning market shares now shrink to less than 5% for all others:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 4%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Alibaba Cloud [made over $11.76 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1238741/alibaba-cloud-annual-revenue/) in 2022.\\n\\nDespite its relatively small market share, Alibaba Cloud still boasts an impressive lineup of services and tools. It offers a 24/7 security center, anti-DDoS and an end-to-end ML platform. These kinds of tools are in demand, so Alibaba may take over more of the market in 2024.\\n\\nIt’s also worth mentioning Alibaba is a big name in China. In 2022, it [made up 36% of the market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1129265/china-cloud-infrastructure-service-market-share-by-company/) for cloud infrastructure services. Considering it’s such a big name there, there’s a strong chance it could expand and become a strong competitor.\\n\\n**5. Huawei**\\n-------------\\n\\nHuawei isn’t big in the United States, but it performs very well in China. That said, it doesn’t come out on top globally:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 4%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Huawei [made more than $45.34 million](https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report/2022) in 2022.\\n\\nHuawei’s cloud service offers all the basics like backups, a content delivery network, ML model development and data visualization tools. Even though it isn’t one of the biggest cloud providers in the United States, it [has a 19% market share](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230925PR203/alibaba-canalys-china-cloud-huawei-server-ipc-cloud-computing-iot-tencent.html) in China — meaning it may overtake competitors like Alibaba in 2024.\\n\\n**6. IBM Cloud**\\n----------------\\n\\nThe International Business Machines (IBM) corporation is a big name in many sectors, but it hasn’t caught up to its competitors in market share or revenue quite yet:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 3%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** IBM Cloud [made over $22.37 million](https://www.ibm.com/annualreport/assets/downloads/IBM_Annual_Report_2022.pdf#page=70) in 2022.\\n\\nSome of IBM’s most sought-after cloud services include pre-configured security and compliance tools, analytics, edge application management, encryption and a content delivery network. It even leverages Watson — its natural language processing AI — to help its clients.\\n\\n**7. Salesforce**\\n-----------------\\n\\nSalesforce’s cloud computing services are profitable. Even though it holds a small market share, it’s still one of the biggest cloud providers around:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 3%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Salesforce’s cloud services [made nearly $7 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/513638/total-revenue-of-salesforce-by-cloud-service/) in 2023.\\n\\nService Cloud is Salesforce’s top-performing service. It offers management dashboards, automation and analytics to improve client relationships and help its users streamline workflows. Although it doesn’t have a lead in the AI niche yet, that may change by 2025.\\n\\n**8. Oracle Cloud**\\n-------------------\\n\\nOracle Cloud may technically have a low market share, but it still outperforms dozens of smaller competitors:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 2%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Oracle Cloud’s services and license support [made $42.44 million](https://investor.oracle.com/investor-news/news-details/2022/Oracle-Announces-Fiscal-2022-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Full-Year-Financial-Results/default.aspx) in 2022.\\n\\nOracle Cloud is one of the few cloud providers offering hybrid, public, dedicated and multi-cloud solutions. Since it’s also delved into AI analytics, tools and development services, it may soon overtake Salesforce and IBM in the cloud computing market.\\n\\n**9. Dell Technologies**\\n------------------------\\n\\nDell Technologies has made some big moves with its cloud services recently, making it stand out as a strong competitor in 2024:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 2%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Dell Technologies [infrastructure solutions made $20.4 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122924/dell-revenue-by-subsegment/) in 2022.\\n\\nThe senior Vice President of Dell Technologies’ Central Eastern Europe, Middle East, Turkey, and Africa region — Mohammed Amin — has [pointed to multi-cloud and generative AI](https://www.itweb.co.za/article/cloud-conversation-has-changed-big-time-says-dell-boss/rxP3jqBEAm2MA2ye) as the company’s focus in 2024.\\n\\nApparently, Amin believes reconsidering cloud users’ preferences and modernizing the company’s approach will be crucial in 2024. Leaders like AWS and Microsoft Azure seem to have considered the same things, meaning it’s a solid business strategy.\\n\\n**10. Tencent Cloud**\\n---------------------\\n\\nEven though Tencent Cloud makes up the lowest market share before getting into 1% and below, it is still technically one of the biggest cloud providers globally:\\n\\n*   **Global market share:** 2%\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Tencent’s cloud computing services [generated over $4.2 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1360805/tencent-cloud-business-revenue/) in 2021.\\n\\nTencent is another one of the cloud providers that does relatively poorly globally but has a strong presence in China. While it may seem like an insignificant company, it stands to outperform Alibaba and Huawei in 2024 if it accelerates multi-cloud and AI tool development.\\n\\n**The Biggest Cloud Providers**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nWhile it’s unlikely AWS and Microsoft Azure will go anywhere, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Oracle and IBM might change rankings. The gap between them is small and their aspirations are large, so there’s a strong chance they’ll be in fierce competition with each other in 2024 and beyond.\\n\\nPost Views:3,664\\n\\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Frehack.com%2Fculture%2Fbiggest-cloud-providers%2F)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Frehack.com%2Fculture%2Fbiggest-cloud-providers%2F)\\n\\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Frehack.com%2Fculture%2Fbiggest-cloud-providers%2F)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frehack.com%2Fculture%2Fbiggest-cloud-providers%2F&media=https://rehack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cloud-1024x610.jpg)\\n\\n[](mailto:?body=https%3A%2F%2Frehack.com%2Fculture%2Fbiggest-cloud-providers%2F)\\n\\nPosts navigation\\n----------------\\n\\n[Previous Post What Is Quantum AI and its Potential in Various Industries?](https://rehack.com/ai/what-is-quantum-ai/)\\n\\n[Next Post How the 0% Cybersecurity Unemployment Rate Affects Your Salary](https://rehack.com/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-unemployment-rate/)\\n\\n#### Recent Stories\\n\\n[AI](https://rehack.com/ai/)\\n\\n##### [What Is the Best AI Detector in 2025?](https://rehack.com/ai/best-ai-detector/)\\n\\nJune 12, 2025 • [Zachary Amos](https://rehack.com/author/zachary/)\\n\\n[Cybersecurity](https://rehack.com/cybersecurity/), [Privacy](https://rehack.com/cybersecurity/privacy/)\\n\\n##### [Is Someone Stalking Your Facebook?

Public Infrastructure as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) services account for the bulk of the market.\\n\\n“While the growth is broad based across geographies and services, clearly AI is making a big difference,” said Dinsdale. “We saw growth of [between] 140 percent to 160 percent in GenAI-specific services, with AI also contributing to service enhancements and added growth across the broader portfolio. The capex numbers are huge, but so are the incremental revenues.”\\n\\nHere are the [cloud market share](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/cloud-market-share-in-q2-microsoft-drops-google-gains-aws-remains-leader \\\"cloud market share\\\") figures for AWS, [Alibaba](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/cloud-giant-alibaba-invests-53b-in-ai-infrastructure-as-stock-surges \\\"Alibaba\\\"), Google, Microsoft and [Oracle](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2025/oracle-disclosed-breach-of-legacy-environment-to-customers-report \\\"Oracle\\\") for the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\n![Image 5](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/media_12f48e61e66096c9a2f4797451b113622d1b1d338.png?width=750&format=png&optimize=medium)\\n\\n**No. 5: Oracle**\\n\\n**Q1 2025 Market Share: 3 Percent**\\n\\n**Q4 2024 Market Share: 3 Percent**\\n\\n**Q1 2024 Market Share: 2 Percent**\\n\\nOracle ranks No. 5 in the global cloud infrastructure services market by winning 3 percent share during the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\nIn March, the Austin, Texas-based company reported total cloud revenue of $6.2 billion for first quarter of calendar year 2025.

Amazon founded these services following its own struggles with speed and scale. Almost two decades later, the cloud computing market is now worth a whopping [$855.7 billion](https://www.imarcgroup.com/public-cloud-market). It’s steadily growing still, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.91%. With its current trajectory, the market might very well surpass the [$1 trillion mark in 2025](https://thecuberesearch.com/cloud-markets-trillion-dollar-evolution-market-share-insights-for-business-leaders/#:~:text=The%20Generative%20AI%20cloud%20game,industry%20leaders%20is%20heating%20up.).\\n\\nCloud market share is an important factor to consider when comparing cloud service providers (CSPs). To make it easier, we’ve gathered and analyzed the cloud market share of top cloud computing and infrastructure service providers, all in a single place. Continue reading to find out where cloud market shares of major CSPs stand as we head into 2025.\\n\\nCloud Market Share Overview and What it Means for Businesses\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGiven Amazon’s early entry, the biggest chunk of the cloud computing market has always belonged to AWS. Other cloud computing leaders, like Microsoft Azure, Google’s GCP, Alibaba Cloud, Oracle, and IBM, have also claimed significant shares. Despite hyperscalers owning a disproportionate share of the cloud market, the market is slowly becoming more diverse and fragmented, with smaller and niche players reporting promising year-over-year growth and challenging hyperscalers’ monopolies.\\n\\nHyperscalers have undeniably proven their worth and resilience, honed their infrastructure, expanded their service portfolios, and maintained customer trust over the years. However, as we’ve discussed in our recent [review of the top 10 CSPs](https://www.emma.ms/blog/top-10-cloud-computing-service-providers), smaller, niche players are often better suited for certain workloads, use cases, and businesses.\\n\\nIn order to balance the scale and reliability of hyperscalers with the flexibility and specialization of niche cloud providers, you can opt for a multi-cloud strategy. Choosing a strategic combination of various cloud providers can improve your organization’s resilience and allow you to maintain control over your cloud landscape as your cloud needs evolve.\\n\\n### How to Leverage Multiple Cloud Providers\\n\\nemma, [cloud management platform](https://www.emma.ms/products/cloud-management-platform), helps you tap into the capabilities and benefits of any number of cloud service providers without having to deal with their underlying differences. It lets you manage all cloud environments from a single visibility and management dashboard, eliminating the usual complexities of managing a multi-cloud. You can centrally optimize your cloud configurations and freely migrate or scale workloads across heterogeneous cloud environments, without running into interoperability and incompatibility issues.\\n\\nAs a result, you can easily choose multiple cloud providers, for instance, hosting mission-critical workloads on experienced hyperscalers while still being able to experiment with ground-breaking, specialized offerings of newer entrants and challengers. By choosing various cloud providers for your different business needs, you can maximize cloud benefits and maintain your cloud freedom.\\n\\nCloud Market Share and Emerging Trends\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/663b80c700da26c11da9a3b1/67866be46998111af588981f_AD_4nXf5KbdFv5eU1qkAfkQ3xOCiMu1qrmhvAEDw2MSsREdDikQ-hR45exQ0IjTyKBSx73bP0JU6e2o8r46QkWvQFbeEjCaYV7o9gn7yJtVJMRsUyY5NXb6RUx2HSn7Ueoiui9PCtvH1xg.png)\\n\\n### AWS\\n\\n*   **AWS Market Share (Q3 2024):**[31%](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/)\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$27.5 billion](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:**19%\\n\\nAWS remains the leader, primarily because of the sheer range of its cloud services. It offers over 200 fully-featured services. However, this breadth of services can sometimes come at the cost of depth. Perhaps that’s why it’s slowly losing ground to some other competitors.\\n\\nAWS had about [33%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) of the market by the end of 2021. It dropped slightly to 32% in Q1 2023 and has since steadied at 31%. This recent decline in market share after years of being an uncontended cloud leader shows how cloud competition is getting fiercer every year. In order to capture a slice of the AWS-dominated market, other vendors have strategically focused on areas where AWS is perceived as lacking. For instance, Azure targets hybrid cloud, while GCP excels in data analytics and AI. Others like Oracle and IBM are trying to address increasing customer demand for transparent pricing, multi-cloud support, and industry-specific solutions.\\n\\n### Azure\\n\\n*   **Azure Market Share (Q3 2024):**[20%](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/)\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$26.7 billion](https://agolution.com/en/microsoft/financial-reporting/2024-q3/#:~:text=Q3%202024%3A%20the%20Cloud%20Results&text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Intelligent%20Cloud,%2C%20which%20amounted%20to%2031%25.)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 21%\\n\\nAWS got the largest slice of the cloud computing market due to its early-mover advantage. Still, Azure has been managing to surpass AWS in growth for years now. Even in Q3 2024, Azure’s 21% Y-o-Y growth surpassed AWS despite the latter bringing in more revenue.\\n\\nThis is because Azure has its ecosystem of Microsoft products (e.g., Office 365, Teams) to its advantage. Combined with a strong hybrid cloud portfolio (Azure Arc, Azure Stack), enterprises often lean towards Azure more than AWS. Despite strong enterprise demand, Azure’s market share has slowly dropped from [24% in 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to 20%, likely due to the rise of niche players.\\n\\n### Google Cloud (GCP)\\n\\n*   **GCP Market Share (Q3 2024):**[12%](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/)\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$11.4 billion](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-cloud-q3-2024-revenue-hits-114bn-data-center-spend-set-to-increase-in-2025/)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 35%\\n\\nGCP’s market share was at its peak at 9.5% in 2019. It fell slightly over the next couple of years to 7%, until the AI revolution happened. Now GCP has reclaimed most of its lost ground mainly because of its customizable and easy-to-use AI/ML offerings.\\n\\n### Alibaba Cloud\\n\\n*   **Alibaba Market Share (Q3 2024):**[4%](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/)\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$4.2 billion](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/alibaba-cloud-revenue-up-7-for-the-quarter-cites-ai-as-key-factor/#:~:text=China's%20Alibaba%20Group%20saw%20its,contributed%20%22an%20increasing%20share.%22)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 7%\\n\\nAlibaba Cloud’s global market share was at [6%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) in 2020, which dropped to a meagre 4% by Q4 2024. Over the past few years, Alibaba has faced a huge decline in its international market due to the geo-political tensions and US-imposed curbs on chip exports to China.\\n\\nWithin China though, Alibaba Cloud is still the leading cloud player with a [36%](https://infotechlead.com/cloud/how-alibaba-huawei-and-tencent-gained-from-11-rise-in-china-cloud-spending-88170) market share. It’s one of the top choices for Chinese and APAC businesses because of its localized support, compliance, and deep integration with Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms.\\n\\n### OCI\\n\\n*   **Oracle Market Share (Q3 2024):** 3%\\n*   **Total Revenue ( Q3 2024):**[$13.3 billion](https://investor.oracle.com/investor-news/news-details/2024/Oracle-Announces-Fiscal-2024-Third-Quarter-Financial-Results/default.aspx) (Overall)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 7%\\n\\nBusinesses already using Oracle’s software products like databases and ERP systems often prefer OCI for its seamless integration. However, Oracle Cloud has slow adoption outside Oracle’s core customer base. OCI held a market share of around [2.8%](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/gartner-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-37-3-in-2019?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in 2019, and is still steady at 3%. Overall,\\n\\n### IBM\\n\\n*   **IBM Market Share (Q3 2024):** 2%\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$14.96 billion](https://futurumgroup.com/insights/ibm-q3-fy-2024-earnings-deliver-strong-software-growth/#:~:text=For%20Q3%202024%2C%20IBM%20reported,effective%20while%20leading%20in%20performance.) (Overall)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 1%\\n\\nBack in 2019, IBM made a strategic decision to focus primarily on the hybrid cloud market. IBM's acquisition of Red Hat led to a modest market growth, but IBM’s share has steadily fluctuated between 2-3% since then. However, last year’s 1% y-o-y growth had little to do with IBM's infrastructure segment, whose revenue fell by [7%](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-q3-2024-results-fail-to-meet-analyst-expectations/#:~:text=The%20quarter%20saw%20total%20revenue,%243bn%20in%20the%20quarter.) last year.\\n\\n### Tencent Cloud\\n\\n*   **Tencent Market Share (Q3 2024):** 2%\\n*   **Total Revenue (Q3 2024):**[$23.14 billion](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2024/11/13/ccffd154b896b6c3e1ae65c13b73761d.pdf) (Overall)\\n*   **Year-over-Year Growth:** 8% \\n\\nTencent Cloud has a strong presence in China and Southeast Asia markets. It is also steadily increasing its datacenter footprint across Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America. Overall, Tencent’s cloud offerings are geared toward gaming, media, and entertainment industries.\\n\\nCloud Market Share by Service Models\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud computing services are available in three primary service models:\\n\\n*   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**provides on-demand access to infrastructure resources, such as compute, storage, and networking.\\n*   **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**provides all the hardware and software resources to develop applications.\\n*   **Software as a Service (SaaS):**provides end-to-end applications that customers can use. \\n\\nThe IaaS and PaaS markets are still dominated primarily by hyperscale giants, including AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba, and IBM. However, the SaaS market shares are much more nuanced and evenly distributed. Here’s what recent [SaaS market shares](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-saas-companies) look like:\\n\\n*   **Salesforce**: 9.3%\\n*   **Microsoft**: 8.7%\\n*   **SAP**: 4.7%\\n*   **Oracle**: 4%\\n*   **Google**: 3.8%\\n\\nOther notable vendors include Adobe, ServiceNow, Zoom, Shopify, Atlassian, HubSpot, Netflix, and more. Overall, when you exclude IaaS and PaaS offerings, the remaining cloud service market is much more diverse and competitive with vendors focusing more on niche offerings rather than comprehensive portfolios.\\n\\nCloud Market Share by Geographic Regions\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud service providers’ [market share trends](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-is-a-global-market-apart-from-china) vary widely across geographic regions:\\n\\n![Image 6](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/663b80c700da26c11da9a3b1/67866be4de6e7f528d24bb3d_AD_4nXcPlGLOhwhVrqOLSisjqxeALb-RI0BGdSTORcOZmbHJYPa-K_3lS_VabBEUPeZNDK_lKLuLE9KqwKxFCb1FuZi5JnPzcmIrHD-m_fZ826e7HKMneJqaDYIiQuCVGrU-ZH4M8d6-1w.png)\\n\\n1.   **USA:** Reflecting global trends, AWS, Azure, and GCP respectively hold the largest cloud computing market share in the US. \\n2.   **Europe:** EU’s cloud computing landscape is governed largely by stringent data privacy and governance regulations. Just like in the US, AWS, Azure, and GCP take the lead in Europe’s cloud market as well. \\n3.   **China:**China’s cloud landscape is significantly different compared to the rest of the world. Local CSPs—Alibaba, Tencent, and China Telecom—claim the top 3 spots, while global cloud leaders—AWS, Azure, and GCP—fail to secure a spot even among China’s top 5. \\n4.   **Rest of APAC:**AWS, Azure, and GCP take the lead in the remaining APAC regions, followed closely by NTT, Alibaba, and Fujitsu.\\n\\nHow to Choose a Cloud Provider?\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nA good cloud market share analysis can give you a clear idea of the market leaders and emerging trends. Other factors you should consider when evaluating CSPs include:\\n\\n*   **Year-over-year growth:** It helps you gauge their future standing and whether they’re likely to maintain their position in the coming years.\\n*   **Digital footprint:**To assess their geographical reach and ability to optimize performance and meet data residency needs.\\n*   **Market reputation**: To analyze the trust and credibility they’ve built within the industry.\\n*   **Cost structure:** To make sure their cost and pricing models align with your budget. \\n*   **Performance and reliability:** To measure the uptime, speed, and overall service consistency they can offer\\n*   **Security and compliance:**To ensure they adhere to regulations and data protection standards.\\n*   **Integrations: To ensure their compatibility with your existing tools and systems.**\\n*   **Administrative support:**To evaluate the quality of customer service and technical assistance they offer.\\n\\nYou need to evaluate all these factors comprehensively against your own business needs to find one or more providers that meet your requirements.
