Consider this:\\n\\n*   About two-thirds of respondents currently operate in a public cloud, and 45% use a private cloud, versus 55% who still rely on traditionally managed on-premises systems.\\n*   48% plan to migrate at least half of their applications to the cloud in the next year; 20% intend to move all their applications to the cloud.\\n*   47% are pursuing a cloud-first strategy, 30% are already cloud-native, and 37% intend to become cloud-native in about three years.\\n*   Only 5% plan on switching from the cloud to on-premises infrastructure (cloud repatriation).\\n\\n### 60% of organizations are running over half of their workloads in the cloud (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nThis marks a steady climb from 39% in 2022. Cloud-first and hybrid strategies continue to grow as businesses move more core operations to cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n### Cloud adoption among enterprise organizations is over 94% (Source: RightScale)\\n\\nMore than 94% of organizations with over 1,000 employees have a significant portion of their workloads in the cloud, according to a survey of 800 organizations. The latest edition shows enterprise cloud computing continues to grow rapidly — and then some. For example:\\n\\n*   More enterprises are exploring a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud approach rather than just using a public or private cloud strategy. More on this later.\\n*   54% will move their workloads to the public cloud in the next 12 months.\\n\\nThere’s more.\\n\\n### Organizations with 1,000 or fewer staff invest big in the cloud (Source: TechRepublic)\\n\\nAbout 44% of traditional small businesses use cloud infrastructure or hosting services. That’s compared to 66% of small tech companies and 74% of enterprises.\\n\\nThere is one more thing. The public cloud will host 63% of SMB workloads and 62% of SMB data within the next year.\\n\\n### The U.S. and Western Europe still dominate cloud computing (Source: ReportLinker)\\n\\nCombined, these two regions account for 82% of the world’s cloud computing. This chart shows cloud adoption by country and region according to Gartner:\\n\\n![Image 5: Growth in IT spending on public cloud services](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/growth-in-it-spending-on-public-cloud-services.webp)\\n**_Credit:_**_Gartner 2022_\\n\\n### 40% of organizations in developing regions are currently evaluating and planning cloud strategies (Oracle and IDC)\\n\\nThe cloud computing industry is not just booming in developed economies. According to new Oracle findings, cloud computing is rapidly developing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as well as in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).\\n\\nCurrently, 30% of respondents report using the cloud. Among companies with more than 2,500 employees, half are planning or evaluating cloud strategies as are 41% of those with 1,000 to 2,500 employees.\\n\\n### Cloud Computing is becoming more popular across lines of business teams (Oracle and IDC)\\n\\nLines of business (LoBs) are even more involved (40%) than IT (38%). That’s a good thing. Both units are leveraging the cloud’s power in different areas of their organizations more than they used to.\\n\\nWhy Are Companies Adopting Cloud Computing So Fast?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOrganizations are [moving to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/solutions/migration) for a variety of compelling reasons. Cloud computing offers several powerful benefits, including:\\n\\n### Cloud computing boosts gross margins and profitability (Source: Wipro FullStride)\\n\\nIn its global survey of 1,300 C-Suite executives, Wipro FullStride Cloud Services showed that a well-executed move to digital increased revenue and [profitability](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-gross-margin).\\n\\nWhile SaaS companies reported the highest margins, others also enjoyed notable gains. As an example, finance executives reported revenue increases of up to 15% and profitability increases of up to 4%.\\n\\nAnother survey by Deloitte showed small and medium businesses that used cloud computing made 21% more profit and grew 26% faster.\\n\\n### Cloud computing generates more revenue (Source: Infosys)\\n\\nThe survey also noted that [migrating to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-migration) helps unlock additional revenue streams that can boost profit growth by as much as 11.2% year-over-year.\\n\\nHere’s the kicker. The survey concluded that your organization needs at least 60% of its workload in the cloud to realize noteworthy financial gains.\\n\\n### Achieve faster time to market (Source: IBM)\\n\\nSome 65% of respondents who identified as “Optimizers” told IBM that cloud computing helped them reduce time to market.

Onwards\\n\\nTop Strategic Cloud Computing Predictions for 2025 and Onwards\\n==============================================================\\n\\n[Blog](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/blog/)|[Cloud Managed Services](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-cloud-managed-services/)\\n\\nApril 18, 2025\\n\\nAs we step into 2025, the cloud computing landscape continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, redefining how businesses innovate, operate, and compete. Cloud technology is no longer just a tool for storage or computing; it has become the backbone of digital transformation across industries. Below, we explore the **top strategic cloud predictions for 2025,** underpinned by the latest trends and data points shaping this dynamic field.\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://www.itconvergence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Raising-the-Stakes-How-CIOs-Can-Set-the-Right-CMS-Strategy-in-2025-CTA.webp)](https://experience.itconvergence.com/ebook-raising-the-stakes-how-cios-can-set-the-right-cms-strategy-in-2025)\\n\\n**Key Predictions for 2025**\\n----------------------------\\n\\n### **1\\\\. Cloud-Native Architecture Will Dominate**\\n\\nBy 2025, cloud-native approaches, including microservices, containers, and Kubernetes, will have cemented themselves as the foundation of modern applications. According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences), over 95% of new digital workloads will be deployed on cloud-native platforms, up from 30% in 2021.\\n\\nThis shift reflects the demand for agility, scalability, and resilience in application development. Companies adopting cloud-native architectures are better positioned to deliver seamless user experiences while significantly reducing their time-to-market.\\n\\n### **2\\\\. The Rise of AI-Driven Cloud Services**\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming integral to cloud computing strategies. Cloud providers are embedding AI into their services, enabling businesses to automate operations, enhance decision-making, and extract insights from vast data volumes.\\n\\nResearch by [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2025-cloud/) predicts that by 2025, enterprises utilizing AI-enabled cloud services will see a 30% boost in operational efficiency. Expect to see more AI-driven tools for predictive analytics, automated workflows, and real-time data processing.\\n\\n### **3\\\\. Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Strategies Become the Norm**\\n\\nOrganizations are moving away from single-cloud dependency to adopt multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies. This trend is driven by the need to avoid vendor lock-in, ensure data sovereignty, and enhance disaster recovery capabilities.\\n\\nA [Flexera report](https://www.scworld.com/brief/managing-the-risks-of-ai-and-multicloud-strategies-in-enterprise-security#:~:text=The%202024%20State%20of%20the,cloud%20computing%20into%20their%20operations.) reveals that 89% of enterprises already embrace multi-cloud strategies, and this number will likely reach near-universal adoption by 2025. Businesses are leveraging the best of each cloud provider, from compute power to AI and analytics tools, to optimize performance and costs.\\n\\n### **4\\\\. Sustainability Takes Center Stage**\\n\\nWith growing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, cloud providers are investing heavily in sustainability. Innovations such as carbon-neutral data centers, energy-efficient cooling solutions, and AI-driven power management are becoming commonplace.\\n\\nFor instance, Microsoft aims to be carbon negative by 2030, and Google has committed to running entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030. These efforts align with predictions from [IDC](https://www.idc.com/), which anticipates that by 2025, over 60% of enterprises will consider sustainability a key factor in selecting cloud providers. In fact, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-21-gartner-predicts-70-percent-of-enterprises-adopting-genai-will-cite-sustainability-and-digital-sovereignty-as-top-criteria-for-selecting-between-different-public-cloud-genai-services-by-2027) predicts that 70% of enterprises with generative AI will cite sustainability and digital sovereignty as top criteria to choose between public cloud services by 2027.\\n\\n### **5\\\\. Enhanced Focus on Cloud Security**\\n\\nAs cloud adoption grows, so do concerns about cybersecurity. The rising number of cyberattacks and data breaches has prompted cloud providers to bolster their security offerings. By 2025, advanced security measures like confidential computing, zero-trust architecture, and quantum-safe encryption will become standard.\\n\\nRecent [research](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) found that 82% of breaches involve cloud-stored data, underscoring the critical need for robust security frameworks. Enterprises will prioritize providers that offer end-to-end security solutions, including continuous monitoring and automated threat detection.\\n\\n### **6\\\\. Edge Computing Gaining Traction**\\n\\nEdge computing, the practice of processing data closer to its source, will expand rapidly in 2025. As IoT devices proliferate and 5G networks mature, businesses require real-time processing to support applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and industrial IoT.\\n\\nA [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/) study forecasts the edge computing market to grow at a CAGR of 37.4% from 2023 to 2030, driven by the demand for low-latency solutions. Cloud providers are integrating edge computing capabilities into their offerings, blurring the lines between cloud and edge environments.\\n\\n### **7\\\\. Vertical Cloud Solutions on the Rise**\\n\\nIndustry-specific cloud solutions, or vertical clouds, are becoming increasingly popular. Tailored to meet the unique needs of sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, these solutions offer pre-built compliance frameworks, specialized tools, and analytics capabilities.\\n\\nFor example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides AWS for Health, while Google Cloud offers its Finance Data Platform. By 2025, vertical clouds will account for 20% of all cloud revenue, according to [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/).\\n\\n### **8\\\\. Cloud Skills Gap Persists**\\n\\nDespite advancements in cloud technology, the talent shortage remains a significant challenge. The demand for skilled professionals in areas like cloud architecture, DevOps, and cybersecurity far outpaces supply.\\n\\nAccording to a [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/) report, 87% of organizations face a skills gap in cloud computing. By 2025, we’ll see a surge in training programs, certifications, and upskilling initiatives to bridge this gap.\\n\\n**The Role of Cloud Managed Services in 2025**\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs businesses navigate this complex and rapidly changing landscape, the role of [**cloud managed services (CMS)**](https://www.itconvergence.com/onprem-and-cloud-managed-services/) will become even more critical. CMS providers enable organizations to leverage cloud technologies without the burden of managing infrastructure, ensuring optimal performance, security, and cost-efficiency.\\n\\nBy outsourcing cloud management to experts, businesses can focus on core objectives while staying ahead in the digital race. According to a recent [report](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-managed-service-market-195317068.html), the global market for managed cloud services is expected to reach $64 billion by 2027, reflecting the growing reliance on these providers.\\n\\n### **Final Thoughts**\\n\\nThe future of cloud computing is both exciting and transformative. From the rise of AI and edge computing to the emphasis on sustainability and security, 2025 promises to bring groundbreaking advancements that will redefine the digital landscape.\\n\\nFor businesses, staying ahead means not only adopting these trends but also partnering with cloud managed services providers to navigate the complexities of the cloud ecosystem. The time to act is now, as the strategic decisions made today will shape your competitive edge in the years to come.\\n\\n#### Subscribe to our blog\\n\\n#### Categories\\n\\n*   [AI & Machine Learning](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-ai-machine-learning/)\\n*   [Analytics](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-analytics/)\\n*   [Blog](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/blog/)\\n*   [Cloud Applications](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-cloud-applications/)\\n    *   [Oracle ERP Cloud](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-cloud-applications/posts-oracle-erp-cloud/)\\n*   [Cloud Managed Services](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-cloud-managed-services/)\\n*   [Data](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-data/)\\n*   [Digital Adoption](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-digital-adoption/)\\n*   [Hyperautomation](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/hyperautomation/)\\n*   [Integration](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/integration/)\\n*   [IoT](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-iot/)\\n*   [JD Edwards](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/jd-edwards/)\\n*   [News](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/news/)\\n*   [Oracle 12.2](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-oracle-12-2/)\\n*   [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-oracle-cloud-infrastructure/)\\n*   [Oracle Hyperion](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-oracle-hyperion/)\\n*   [Press Releases](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/press-release/)\\n*   [RPA](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-rpa/)\\n*   [Testing](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-testing/)\\n*   [Tradeshows](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/tradeshow/)\\n*   [Training](https://www.itconvergence.com/category/posts-training/)\\n\\n### Related Posts\\n\\n[](https://www.itconvergence.com/blog/maximizing-performance-and-efficiency-with-oracle-linux-virtualization-in-the-cloud/)\\n\\nMaximizing Performance and Efficiency with Oracle Linux Virtualization in the Cloud\\n\\n[](https://www.itconvergence.com/blog/learn-how-oracle-database-23ai-brings-ai-to-your-data/)\\n\\nLearn How Oracle Database 23ai Brings AI to your Data\\n\\n[](https://www.itconvergence.com/blog/re-host-vs-re-platform-vs-re-factor-which-migration-strategy-to-choose/)\\n\\nRe-Host vs Re-Platform vs Re-Factor: Which Migration Strategy to Choose\\n\\n  \\n\\nSERVICES\\n\\n*   [Digital Transformation](https://www.itconvergence.com/digital-transformation/)\\n*   [Managed Services](https://www.itconvergence.com/managed-services-provider/)\\n*   [Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.itconvergence.com/cloud-infrastructure/)\\n*   [Robotic Process Automation](https://www.itconvergence.com/robotic-process-automation/)\\n*   [Analytics](https://www.itconvergence.com/analytics/)\\n\\nINSIGHTS\\n\\n*   [Blog](https://www.itconvergence.com/blog/)\\n*   [Case Studies](https://www.itconvergence.com/case-studies/)\\n*   [White Papers](https://www.itconvergence.com/white-papers/)\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\n*   [About](https://www.itconvergence.com/about/)\\n*   [Leadership](https://www.itconvergence.com/leadership/)\\n*   [Careers](https://www.itconvergence.com/careers/)\\n*   [Contact](https://www.itconvergence.com/contact/)\\n\\nFOLLOW US\\n\\n*   [Follow](https://twitter.com/it_convergence \\\"Follow on Twitter\\\")\\n*   [Follow](https://www.facebook.com/itc.corp/ \\\"Follow on Facebook\\\")\\n*   [Follow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/it-convergence \\\"Follow on LinkedIn\\\")\\n*   [Follow](https://www.youtube.com/user/ITConvergenceMKT \\\"Follow on Youtube\\\")\\n*   [Follow](https://www.itconvergence.com/blog/top-strategic-cloud-computing-predictions-for-2025-and-onwards/# \\\"Follow on RSS\\\")\\n\\n© 2023 IT Convergence | All Rights Reserved | [Privacy Policy](https://www.itconvergence.com/privacy-policy/)\\n\\nWe use cookies to improve your experience on our site.

The increasing global demand for cloud computing is driven by emerging technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). The growing focus on customer-centric applications to enhance consumer satisfaction also contributes to these technologies' rise.\\n\\nCloud-based infrastructure provides flexible and on-demand resource access, supporting new digital business solutions. This technology is beneficial for enterprise resource planning (ERP), online transaction processing (OLTP), and supply chain management (SCM) across various sectors.\\n\\nIn May 2024, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud computing division, announced a substantial investment of EUR 7.8 billion (USD 8.5 billion) in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud initiative. The first cloud region will be established in Germany and operational by the end of 2025. This investment will continue until 2040. The purpose of this Sovereign Cloud is to enhance data residency across Europe.\\n\\nThe market is also witnessing several investments that significantly drive the adoption of cloud computing. For instance, in April 2024, Oracle Corporation Japan unveiled an ambitious plan, committing over USD 8 billion in the coming decade. This investment is strategically aimed at catering to Japan's escalating cloud computing and AI infrastructure needs. The initiative will bolster the presence of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and underscore Oracle's commitment to the Japanese market.\\n\\nAlso, recognizing the importance of digital sovereignty, Oracle is set to ramp up its operations. This expansion substantially boosts its engineering teams, focusing on recruiting local talent and aligning closely with Japan's requirements.\\n\\nOrganizations increasingly require secure and efficient solutions to facilitate remote work for their employees, including contact center agents and creative professionals. Providers are addressing this need by offering specialized cloud-based solutions that ensure security, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness.\\n\\nCloud computing, a technology that provides on-demand platforms, software, and infrastructure, is vulnerable to various data breaches. Customers still express concerns about outsourcing their data to public cloud services when assured of strong security measures. Despite the efforts of cloud service providers to protect client data, several data breach incidents have affected even the most prominent businesses.\\n\\nFor instance, in June 2024, Thales unveiled its 2024 Cloud Security Study, a comprehensive annual report that examines the latest cloud security threats, trends, and emerging risks. The study gathers insights from a survey of nearly 3000 IT and security professionals across 18 countries and 37 industries.\\n\\nAs organizations increasingly depend on cloud services, these resources have become prime targets for cyber-attacks. Specifically, SaaS applications (31%), cloud storage (30%), and cloud management infrastructure (26%) are the most frequently attacked categories. Consequently, protecting cloud environments has become the foremost security priority, surpassing all other security disciplines.\\n\\nThe study also states that 44% of organizations have experienced a cloud data breach, with 14% reporting an incident in the last 12 months. Human error and misconfiguration remain the leading causes of these breaches (31%), followed by the exploitation of known vulnerabilities (28%) and the failure to use multi-factor authentication (17%).\\n\\nFurther, macroeconomic trends have a significant impact on the cloud computing market. The rising inflationary pressure will likely increase the costs of professional services for companies operating in a cloud environment. For instance, according to OECD, the annual monthly inflation rate in the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) increased steadily from February 2021 to October 2022, when the inflation rate reached 10.7% compared to the same month the previous year.\\n\\n## Cloud Computing Market Trends\\n\\n### Business Integration with Cloud Accelerating Digital Transformation Across Industries\\n\\n![Cloud Computing Market: Enterprise Public Cloud Adoption, By Service, In Percentage (%),  Worldwide, 2017-2023](https://s3.mordorintelligence.com/cloud-computing-market/1727696650316-cloud-computing-market-Enterprise-Public-Cloud-Adoption-By-Service-In-Percentage---Worldwide-2017-2023.png \\\"Cloud Computing Market Trends\\\")\\n\\n### North America is Expected to Hold a Major Market Share\\n\\n![Cloud Computing Market - Cloud Computing Market - Market CAGR (%), By Region, Global](https://s3.mordorintelligence.com/cloud-computing-market/1727696638248-cloud-computing-market-Cloud-Computing-Market---Market-CAGR--By-Region-Global.png \\\"Cloud Computing Market Trends\\\")\\n\\n## Cloud Computing Industry Overview\\n\\n### \\n\\nThe cloud computing market is experiencing notable fragmentation, with numerous players competing for market share.

David](https://www.simplilearn.com/authors/matthew-david)\\n\\nShare This Article:\\n\\nLast updated on May 3, 2025 11699\\n\\n![Image 5: Top Cloud Computing Trends in 2025](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/cloud_computing.jpg)\\n\\nCloud Computing will keep growing in 2025 as companies continue to leverage the economies and services cloud vendors offer. Below is our take on the significant Cloud Computing trends we expect to see in 2025.\\n\\nWhat is Cloud Computing?\\n------------------------\\n\\n[](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cloud-computing-tutorial/what-is-cloud-computing \\\"Cloud computing\\\")Cloud computing[](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cloud-computing-tutorial/what-is-cloud-computing \\\"Cloud computing\\\")is a framework that provides computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, and software applications) over the internet alternative to local hardware and infrastructure. This means that users can access these resources from anywhere, at any time on any device with an internet connection.\\n\\n### Software as a Service (SaaS)\\n\\n[Software as a Service](https://www.simplilearn.com/resources \\\"Software as a Service\\\") (SaaS) is a type of cloud computing service in which the provider hosts software applications and makes them available to customers over the internet. SaaS applications are usually accessed through a web browser and users have to pay a subscription charge. A few examples of SaaS applications are email services, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and project management tools.\\n\\nBecome a Cloud Computing & DevOps Professional\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   **101K**Cloud Job Roles Available Worldwide\\n*   **23.1%**Annual Growth Rate\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 6: AWS Solutions Architect](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/new_logo.svgz) \\n\\n#### AWS Solutions Architect\\n\\n    *   Lifetime access to 50 hours of e-learning content\\n    *   16 live demos of AWS services\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 7: Cloud Architect Masters Program](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/master_program/masters-badge-2.svgz) \\n\\n#### Cloud Architect Masters Program\\n\\n    *   Get access to an MS Azure exam voucher for any one Azure course\\n    *   Earn a course completion badge/certificate on the MS Learn portal\\n\\n4 months\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\nprev Next\\n\\n### Here's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\\n\\n*   ![Image 8: Mario Scott](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/mario-%20linkedin.jpg) #### Mario Scott\\n\\n##### Solutions Manager, **DealerOps** \\nWhile working as a cloud engineer, I realized the potential in DevOps and wanted to explore that as a career opportunity.

These resources can be used to build, deploy, and manage their applications and services. With IaaS, customers are capable of managing and maintaining the software applications they run on the virtual infrastructure.\\n\\n### Platform as a Service (PaaS)\\n\\n[Platform as a Service](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-paas-article \\\"Platform as a Service\\\") (PaaS) is a type of cloud computing service in which the user gets access to a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications. PaaS providers typically offer tools and services that help developers build, test, and deploy applications and also can manage the underlying infrastructure. PaaS can be seen as a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS as it provides more control and flexibility than SaaS but with less management overhead than IaaS.\\n\\nTop Cloud Computing Trends for 2025\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThere are many emerging trends in Cloud computing as mentioned below:\\n\\n### 1. Introduction of the Citizen Developer\\n\\nThe first under the Cloud Computing trends is the introduction of the citizen developer. The Citizen Developer concept opens up the power of connected systems to people who can not code. Tools such as If This Then That introduced ways in which ordinary folks (i.e., those of us that have not spent four years getting a Computer Science degree) can connect popular APIs and create customized automation.\\n\\nMoving through 2025, expect to see Microsoft, [AWS](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/aws-tutorial/what-is-aws \\\"AWS\\\"), Google, and many other companies release tools that make it easy for developers to create complex apps with a drag and drop interface. Microsoft's Power Platform is arguably the leader in this space with Power Apps, Power Flow, Power AI, and Power Builder. The four tools combined can create complex mobile and web apps that can interact with business tools. AWS is not resting, either, with the introduction of HoneyCode.\\n\\nWe will now look into the next cloud computing trend.\\n\\n### 2. Better AI/ML Capabilities\\n\\nCloud providers are increasingly embedding AI capabilities into their services, enabling businesses to leverage advanced analytics, machine learning, and automation without extensive in-house expertise. This integration facilitates the development of intelligent applications and enhances operational efficiencies.\\n\\nAs a company, AWS has been building machine learning technology. They have many new integrations in the works with the latest AWS DeepLens camera.\\n\\nGoogle is also heavily invested in [machine learning](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/what-is-machine-learning \\\"machine learning\\\"), and they have all kinds of machine learning-based products. We recently saw the rollout of Google Lens, which allows you to point your camera at things in the world to find out more information. I expect we'll see that deployed in other parts of their Google product line this year. They know the importance of machine learning and its significance to their AI roadmap.\\n\\nIBM is an enterprise leader in this space and is one of the driving forces behind a significant shift in how computing is conducted. Most of their investments have been in AI and machine learning-related initiatives.\\n\\nThe next under the cloud computing trends is automation.\\n\\n### 3. Automation\\n\\nThe secret sauce for Cloud is the potential for [automation](https://www.simplilearn.com/how-ai-automation-is-evolving-in-2022-article \\\"automation\\\"). When done right, automation can increase your delivery team's efficiency, improve the quality of systems and networks, and reduce the risk associated with slow systems or downtime. The challenge is that automation is not easy. As the investment in citizen developer tools and AI expands, expect to see more devices released to make automation much more comfortable with cloud vendors.\\n\\n### 4. Continued Investment in Data\\n\\nThe Cloud has already extended to helping organizations analyze, store, collate and analyze data. That trend will continue, but data will be stored in much larger databases in a distributed computing environment in the future.\\n\\nA big step forward will be to process large volumes of data by storing it not in databases but in graphics processing units (GPUs), which can massively parallelize computing. This trend is already well underway and is likely to continue to grow over the coming years. This change has many ramifications, from how we compute, store, and use data to the type of business systems we will develop in the future.\\n\\nIt is also going to increase the need for new computer architectures. As data continues to grow, it will be distributed across many different machines across the data center, and many of these machines will be running traditional and new computing models. The conventional CPU is an example of a system architecture that will be made less relevant in the future, as it cannot perform processing across many nodes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, GPUs can be configured to perform this processing on clusters of machines and, while they don't have a general-purpose processor like a CPU, they can be programmed to run many types of operations.\\n\\nUltimately, all this will result in organizations needing to run a vast number of algorithms parallel to clusters of machines to perform real-time analyses. In this way, the Cloud will enable organizations to acquire computing resources in a flexible, agile manner.\\n\\nLet's look at the next under the [cloud computing](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cloud-computing-tutorial \\\"cloud computing\\\") trends.\\n\\nBecome a Cloud Computing & DevOps Professional\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   **101K**Cloud Job Roles Available Worldwide\\n*   **23.1%**Annual Growth Rate\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 10: AWS Solutions Architect](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/new_logo.svgz) \\n\\n#### AWS Solutions Architect\\n\\n    *   Lifetime access to 50 hours of e-learning content\\n    *   16 live demos of AWS services\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 11: Cloud Architect Masters Program](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/master_program/masters-badge-2.svgz) \\n\\n#### Cloud Architect Masters Program\\n\\n    *   Get access to an MS Azure exam voucher for any one Azure course\\n    *   Earn a course completion badge/certificate on the MS Learn portal\\n\\n4 months\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\nprev Next\\n\\n### Here's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\\n\\n*   ![Image 12: Mario Scott](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/mario-%20linkedin.jpg) #### Mario Scott\\n\\n##### Solutions Manager, **DealerOps** \\nWhile working as a cloud engineer, I realized the potential in DevOps and wanted to explore that as a career opportunity.

The competition will come in three distinct ways:\\n\\n*   Pricing and Financial Incentives\\n*   Reliability\\n*   Other vendors\\n\\nThe fastest way to break down investment barriers is to lower costs. The model that AWS introduces (you pay for what you use) will expand through all services and replace subscription models. Expect to see all cloud companies deliver tools that clearly show resource usage and the service's per-byte cost.\\n\\n### 6. Kubernetes and Docker to Manage Cloud Deployment\\n\\n[Kubernetes](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/kubernetes-tutorial/what-is-kubernetes \\\"Kubernetes\\\") is an open-source container orchestration platform which can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Docker is a popular containerization platform which empowers developers to package their applications developed to run on any platform into containers. Kubernetes and Docker can transform the way developers manage cloud deployments. Moreover, it enables developers to easily and more efficiently deploy and scale applications.\\n\\nBecome a Cloud Computing & DevOps Professional\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   **101K**Cloud Job Roles Available Worldwide\\n*   **23.1%**Annual Growth Rate\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 14: AWS Solutions Architect](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/new_logo.svgz) \\n\\n#### AWS Solutions Architect\\n\\n    *   Lifetime access to 50 hours of e-learning content\\n    *   16 live demos of AWS services\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 15: Cloud Architect Masters Program](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/master_program/masters-badge-2.svgz) \\n\\n#### Cloud Architect Masters Program\\n\\n    *   Get access to an MS Azure exam voucher for any one Azure course\\n    *   Earn a course completion badge/certificate on the MS Learn portal\\n\\n4 months\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\nprev Next\\n\\n### Here's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\\n\\n*   ![Image 16: Mario Scott](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/mario-%20linkedin.jpg) #### Mario Scott\\n\\n##### Solutions Manager, **DealerOps** \\nWhile working as a cloud engineer, I realized the potential in DevOps and wanted to explore that as a career opportunity.

Cloud providers are constantly adding new features and capabilities to empower businesses to stay competitive and move with industry trends.\\n\\n**Find Our Cloud Computing Training in Top Cities** **India****United States****Other Countries** [Cloud Computing Training in Bangalore](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Bangalore\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Austin](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Austin\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Melbourne](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Melbourne\\\") [Cloud Computing Training in Delhi](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Delhi\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Denver](https://www.simplilearn.com/pgp-cloud-computing-certification-training-course-in-denver-city \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Denver\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Riyadh](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Riyadh\\\") [Cloud Computing Training in Chennai](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Chennai\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Dallas](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Dallas\\\")[Cloud Computing Training in Singapore](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program \\\"Cloud Computing Training in Singapore\\\")\\n\\nIn addition to greater transparency for services, also expect Cloud companies to offer deals for large commitments. The cloud companies want your business and are willing to pay for it. If you are making any investment into the Cloud, you should be asking the service provider to be clear on what investment they are making into you as a customer.\\n\\nReliability is another key differentiator. There was a time when Google Cloud Platform suffered a significant service interruption. The interruption impacted many companies and was a black eye for GCP. The reality, however, is that cloud hosting reliability has never been better. With that said, expect all vendors to continue to double down on reliability.\\n\\nIn many ways, it is early days for the Cloud, and many other companies, such as Alibaba, IBM, and TCS, want you to use their cloud services. More competition equals better choices for customers. There is big money going into Cloud, and you should ask all of your vendors what their Cloud strategy is and where they can provide you the financial incentive to use their Cloud services.\\n\\nTo position your enterprise to take full advantage of the future trends in cloud computing, you need to ensure your team has the skills to create and implement a winning cloud strategy. You’ll want to look into upskilling in [cloud computing courses](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing \\\"cloud computing courses\\\") such as the [Post Graduate Program in Cloud Computing](https://www.simplilearn.com/cloud-computing-devops-certificate-program?source=GhPreviewCoursepages \\\"Post Graduate Program in Cloud Computing\\\")for your key staff members.\\n\\nBecome a Cloud Computing & DevOps Professional\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n*   **101K**Cloud Job Roles Available Worldwide\\n*   **23.1%**Annual Growth Rate\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 26: AWS Solutions Architect](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/new_logo.svgz) \\n\\n#### AWS Solutions Architect\\n\\n    *   Lifetime access to 50 hours of e-learning content\\n    *   16 live demos of AWS services\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\n*   \\n![Image 27: Cloud Architect Masters Program](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/master_program/masters-badge-2.svgz) \\n\\n#### Cloud Architect Masters Program\\n\\n    *   Get access to an MS Azure exam voucher for any one Azure course\\n    *   Earn a course completion badge/certificate on the MS Learn portal\\n\\n4 months\\n\\n[View Program](javascript:void(0))\\n\\nprev Next\\n\\n### Here's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\\n\\n*   ![Image 28: Mario Scott](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/mario-%20linkedin.jpg) #### Mario Scott\\n\\n##### Solutions Manager, **DealerOps** \\nWhile working as a cloud engineer, I realized the potential in DevOps and wanted to explore that as a career opportunity.

Consider this:\\n\\n*   About two-thirds of respondents currently operate in a public cloud, and 45% use a private cloud, versus 55% who still rely on traditionally managed on-premises systems.\\n*   48% plan to migrate at least half of their applications to the cloud in the next year; 20% intend to move all their applications to the cloud.\\n*   47% are pursuing a cloud-first strategy, 30% are already cloud-native, and 37% intend to become cloud-native in about three years.\\n*   Only 5% plan on switching from the cloud to on-premises infrastructure (cloud repatriation).\\n\\n### 60% of organizations are running over half of their workloads in the cloud (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nThis marks a steady climb from 39% in 2022. Cloud-first and hybrid strategies continue to grow as businesses move more core operations to cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n### Cloud adoption among enterprise organizations is over 94% (Source: RightScale)\\n\\nMore than 94% of organizations with over 1,000 employees have a significant portion of their workloads in the cloud, according to a survey of 800 organizations. The latest edition shows enterprise cloud computing continues to grow rapidly — and then some. For example:\\n\\n*   More enterprises are exploring a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud approach rather than just using a public or private cloud strategy. More on this later.\\n*   54% will move their workloads to the public cloud in the next 12 months.\\n\\nThere’s more.\\n\\n### Organizations with 1,000 or fewer staff invest big in the cloud (Source: TechRepublic)\\n\\nAbout 44% of traditional small businesses use cloud infrastructure or hosting services.

According to new Oracle findings, cloud computing is rapidly developing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as well as in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).\\n\\nCurrently, 30% of respondents report using the cloud. Among companies with more than 2,500 employees, half are planning or evaluating cloud strategies as are 41% of those with 1,000 to 2,500 employees.\\n\\n### Cloud Computing is becoming more popular across lines of business teams (Oracle and IDC)\\n\\nLines of business (LoBs) are even more involved (40%) than IT (38%). That’s a good thing. Both units are leveraging the cloud’s power in different areas of their organizations more than they used to.\\n\\nWhy Are Companies Adopting Cloud Computing So Fast?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOrganizations are [moving to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/solutions/migration) for a variety of compelling reasons. Cloud computing offers several powerful benefits, including:\\n\\n### Cloud computing boosts gross margins and profitability (Source: Wipro FullStride)\\n\\nIn its global survey of 1,300 C-Suite executives, Wipro FullStride Cloud Services showed that a well-executed move to digital increased revenue and [profitability](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-gross-margin).\\n\\nWhile SaaS companies reported the highest margins, others also enjoyed notable gains. As an example, finance executives reported revenue increases of up to 15% and profitability increases of up to 4%.\\n\\nAnother survey by Deloitte showed small and medium businesses that used cloud computing made 21% more profit and grew 26% faster.\\n\\n### Cloud computing generates more revenue (Source: Infosys)\\n\\nThe survey also noted that [migrating to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-migration) helps unlock additional revenue streams that can boost profit growth by as much as 11.2% year-over-year.\\n\\nHere’s the kicker. The survey concluded that your organization needs at least 60% of its workload in the cloud to realize noteworthy financial gains.\\n\\n### Achieve faster time to market (Source: IBM)\\n\\nSome 65% of respondents who identified as “Optimizers” told IBM that cloud computing helped them reduce time to market.

The following cloud computing stats provide key examples:\\n\\n### 47% of corporate cloud data was considered sensitive in 2024 (Source: Thales Group)\\n\\nThales found that nearly half of all corporate data stored in the cloud contains sensitive information. This includes personal details, financial records, and health data — raising ongoing concerns around cloud security and compliance.\\n\\n### Business and financial records remain the most stored sensitive data in the cloud (Source: GetAstra, 2024)\\n\\nAbout 53% of sensitive data in the cloud is related to finance or business. Employee records (48%) and customer data (44%) follow closely, showing a consistent trend in what organizations store in public cloud environments.\\n\\n### The cloud will host more than 100 zettabytes of data by 2025 (Source: Forbes)\\n\\nCloud usage generates a colossal amount of data daily. Within three years, the world will generate over 200,000 terabytes of data. Half of that will be stored in the cloud. This emphasizes the growing need to capture, process, analyze, secure, and utilize data effectively.\\n\\nThat’s not all.\\n\\n### IoT devices will generate a whole lot of data (Source: Cisco)\\n\\nBy 2025, Cisco estimates there will be more than 75 billion Internet of Things devices worldwide. This figure covers connected devices across B2B and B2C segments, such as smart homes, intelligent security systems, and connected cars.\\n\\n### Data analytics is key to enabling digital transformation (Source: Gartner)\\n\\nData is a critical organizational asset for 90% of organizations. That makes data analytics a core competency every organization will want to develop. Data fabrics use APIs to break down silos, allowing organizations to consolidate data access, management, and security across multiple cloud providers.\\n\\nA centralized data management framework reduces vendor lock-in and allows organizations to utilize their distributed services to gain a unified view of their operations.\\n\\n### 46% of European companies store all their data in the cloud (Source: Thales)\\n\\nThales Europe found that 43% of the data is classified as “sensitive.” While a quarter of companies admit to suffering a breach in the past year, only 54% of their sensitive data is encrypted.\\n\\n### Cloud computing is a modern data protection strategy (Source: Veeam)\\n\\nThe cloud plays a crucial role in today’s data protection strategy, according to half of the surveyed businesses. They told Veeam that they moved to the cloud as a way to do disaster recovery using a cloud service (54%), to migrate workloads to the cloud (50%), and to shift workloads between clouds (48%).\\n\\nCloud Security Statistics\\n-------------------------\\n\\nCloud computing security remains one of the most concerning aspects of operation — and a key barrier to cloud migration for some. Here are some things you need to know.\\n\\n### 95% of companies are concerned about cloud security (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nFortinet reported that almost everyone is moderately or extremely concerned about security in the cloud.\\n\\n![Image 31: Concerns about cloud security](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/concerns-about-cloud-security.webp)\\nThe concern is justified, considering that:\\n\\n### Cybercrime costs an organization about $13.0 million on average (Source: Accenture)\\n\\nThe State of CyberSecurity Report by Accenture examines the cost of cybercrime and makes it easier to quantify the economic cost of malicious activities in cyberspace.\\n\\n### The average cost of a data breach rose to $4.88 million in 2024 (Source: IBM)\\n\\nHealthcare remains the hardest hit, with breach costs averaging over $10.9 million. This marks a steady rise as threats grow more complex and widespread.\\n\\n### Ransomware accounts for 24% of all cyberattacks in 2025 (Source: Integrity360)\\n\\nRansomware is still one of the most common and costly attack types. Phishing remains the top entry point, with attackers impersonating brands such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple.\\n\\n### Data breaches exposed over 16.8 billion records in 2024 (Source: Flashpoint)\\n\\nIn 2024, data breaches increased by 6%, exposing over 16.8 billion records. This surge was primarily due to compromised credentials, ransomware, and vulnerability exploits. ​\\n\\n### 73% believe cloud technology has increased complexity (Source: Fujitsu and Vitreous World)\\n\\nA survey revealed that 73% of respondents think cloud technology has added complexity to their operations. Additionally, 70% of CIOs feel they have less control due to cloud technologies. ​\\n\\n### IT downtime costs an average of $14,056 per minute in 2024 (Source: BigPanda)\\n\\nResearch indicates that unplanned IT downtime now averages $14,056 per minute. For large enterprises, this figure rises to $23,750 per minute. ​\\n\\n### It takes almost two hours to resolve server downtime (Source: Veeam)\\n\\nThe Data Protection Trends Report showed that 95% of organizations struggle with unexpected outages. The average outage lasts almost 2 hours (117 minutes).\\n\\nFor a High Priority application, an hour of downtime costs $67,651, while for a Normal application, it costs $61,642. Downtime is unacceptably costly in today’s business environment.\\n\\nFor enterprises, the cost can be wildly higher.\\n\\n### A single hour of downtime costs enterprises over $100,000 (Source: Accenture)\\n\\nThat is according to nearly all (98%) of surveyed leaders. Some 40% of enterprises said they lost $1-$5 million in just one hour of downtime. This eye-watering cost excludes legal fees, fines, or penalties.\\n\\nAdd Service Level Agreement (SLA) obligations and other forms of inconveniences and business losses, and you are looking at even larger damage.\\n\\n### Misconfiguration is responsible for 68% of issues (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nOrganizations ranked the following threats as the most significant security threats to their public clouds:\\n\\n*   Misconfiguration (68%)\\n*   Unauthorized access (58%)\\n*   Insecure interfaces (52%)\\n*   Hijacking of accounts (50%)\\n\\nMeanwhile, most apps have fewer than three security certifications, while IT-owned apps are more likely to utilize single sign-on (SSO). Similarly, many organizations had not prioritized cybersecurity and compliance:\\n\\n![Image 32: Cybersecurity and compliance](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cybersecurity-and-compliance-1.webp)\\n### Zero trust policies are a thing now (Source: Fortnet)\\n\\nMore organizations are implementing zero trust policies to improve their cloud security, according to Fortinet. Consider this:\\n\\n![Image 33: Zero Trust Policies](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zero-trust-policies.webp)\\n_What organizations hope implementing zero trust policies will achieve._\\n\\nTop Cloud Concerns For Decision-Makers\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nApart from cloud security concerns, organizations pointed to several other issues as the biggest unforeseen factors that slow or stop cloud adoption.\\n\\n### Managing costs is the biggest challenge to cloud adoption (Source: Flexera)\\n\\nAmong those surveyed for the State of the Cloud Report, managing cloud costs and security were the main reasons for not fully embracing cloud computing.

As such, it is no surprise that cloud is becoming increasingly important as organizations demand more flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in how they manage and access data.\\n\\nTraditional on-premises compute resources and databases often struggle to meet the needs of modern digital applications, which require real-time responsiveness, global availability, and elastic resource allocation. In contrast, cloud resources offer on-demand provisioning, automatic scaling, and built-in redundancy, enabling businesses to adapt quickly to changing workloads without significant infrastructure investments.\\n\\nWith growing trends in edge computing, IoT, and decentralized data generation, cloud is well-positioned to act as the connective tissue between diverse data sources and intelligent services, driving innovation and faster time to insight.\\n\\n![AI/ML     Powering AI Workloads with Intelligent Data Infrastructure and Open Source  ](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/8019034/interactive-179325296390.png)\\n\\n### Cloud Trends for 2025\\n\\nAs organizations shift from viewing the cloud merely as an IT utility to seeing it as a central business enabler, [Gartner recently identified six pivotal trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-05-13-gartner-identifies-top-trends-shaping-the-future-of-cloud) set to define cloud strategies through 2029. They include:\\n\\n**1. Cloud Dissatisfaction Is Rising**\\n\\nDespite rapid cloud adoption, success remains uneven. Gartner forecasts that by **2028, 25% of organizations** will report significant dissatisfaction with their cloud initiatives. The main culprits are unmet expectations, flawed strategy, and runaway costs. The remedy? Clear-eyed strategy and disciplined execution. Those who prioritize strategic alignment are likely to see dissatisfaction rates decline post-2029.\\n\\n**2. AI/ML Demand Will Skyrocket**\\n\\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is transforming cloud infrastructure. Gartner predicts that by **2029**, **50% of cloud compute usage** will be driven by AI/ML workloads. That’s a dramatic leap from current levels that are under 10%, according to Gartner. Hyperscalers will continue building AI-friendly platforms, combining real and synthetic data, and distributing intelligence across hybrid environments.\\n\\n**3. Multi-cloud Complexity Persists**\\n\\nMany enterprises are pursuing multi-cloud or cross-cloud architectures to enhance resilience and avoid vendor lock-in. Yet Gartner cautions that **over 50% of these efforts will fail to deliver on expected benefits by 2029**. The most common barriers are interoperability issues and fragmented operations. To succeed, organizations must clearly define use cases, and plan federated workloads across multiple clouds and on-prem environments.\\n\\n**4. Rise of Industry-Specific Cloud Platforms**\\n\\nCloud solutions tailored to vertical sectors, from healthcare to manufacturing, are rapidly gaining traction. Gartner expects that by **2029**, more than **half of organizations** will leverage industry cloud platforms to accelerate outcomes. These platforms deliver pre-built compliance, workflows, and analytics.\\n\\n![AI/ML     Powering AI Workloads with Intelligent Data Infrastructure and Open Source  ](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/8019034/interactive-179325296390.png)\\n\\n**5. Digital Sovereignty Takes Center Stage**\\n\\nConcerns around data residency, privacy, and geopolitical controls are driving demand for sovereign cloud services. Gartner forecasts that by **2029**, over **50% of global multinationals** will adopt digital sovereignty strategies, up considerably from fewer than 10% today. In an era of complex regulations and increasing data nationalism, cloud providers must offer localized control over infrastructure and governance.\\n\\n**6. Sustainability Isn’t Optional**\\n\\nWith AI’s momentum comes a surge in cloud energy consumption and environmental scrutiny. Regulators, investors, and customers increasingly expect sustainable practices in cloud operations. Providers and users alike will need to measure, manage, and reduce carbon footprints.\\n\\n**See also:** [Cloud Market Surged to $330 Billion, Driven Largely by Generative AI](https://www.clouddatainsights.com/cloud-market-surged-to-330-billion-driven-largely-by-generative-ai/)\\n\\n### Why These Trends Matter\\n\\nCloud is no longer optional. It forms the backbone of digital agility, competitive advantage, and operational resilience. These trends underscore the shift from purely technical optimization to holistic business enablement.\\n\\nAs half of compute shifts toward AI/ML, organizations must evaluate whether their data architectures, latency strategies, and governance models can support scalable intelligence.\\n\\nAdditionally, multi-cloud and digital sovereignty trends highlight the need for mature governance frameworks that balance agility with compliance, cost control, and geopolitical considerations.\\n\\nOff-the-shelf SaaS is giving way to vertical platforms optimized for regulation-heavy industries. These offer faster time to value and less domain-specific overhead.\\n\\n![AI/ML     Powering AI Workloads with Intelligent Data Infrastructure and Open Source  ](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/8019034/interactive-179325296390.png)\\n\\n### A Final Word\\n\\nThe use of the cloud is turbocharged by AI and defined by increasingly complex governance, cost, and environmental demands. As such, cloud computing and cloud databases in 2025 are at a crossroads, facing multiple challenges.\\n\\nBy framing cloud as a strategic asset rather than just a technical choice, leaders can transform these challenges into long-term competitive advantages.\\n\\n![](https://www.clouddatainsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sal-headshot-150x150-1.webp)\\n\\nSalvatore Salamone is a physicist by training who has been writing about science and information technology for more than 30 years.

2025](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/medium_Top_Cloud_Computing_Trends_in_2025_8e04f1a6ef.png)\\n\\nIn 2025, we’re seeing a shift from basic cloud adoption to intentional innovation. Back in 2020, the cloud was primarily a lifeline: a tool for business continuity, remote access, and scaling under pressure. But now, that baseline capability is expected. The conversation has shifted from _“**Can we run in the cloud?**”_ to _“**How intelligently and securely can we run in the cloud?**”_\\n\\nWhat’s emerging is a more strategic, nuanced approach. Organizations are looking beyond raw infrastructure to platforms that help them move faster, make smarter decisions, and align more tightly with business goals. Complexity is growing—but so is opportunity.\\n\\nRecent data underscores this transformation.**According to**[**Gartner**](https://www.gartner.com/en/infrastructure-and-it-operations-leaders/insights/deliver-platforms-and-services-to-enable-digital-transformation)**, by the end of 2025, over 70% of enterprises will have adopted industry cloud platforms to accelerate business initiatives.**[**IDC**](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP51917824&utm_source=chatgpt.com)**reports that 80% of global enterprises will prioritize intelligence and automation in their IT investments by mid-decade.**\\n\\nThis blog explores the forces behind that shift and the eight cloud trends that are beginning to reshape everything from architecture and developer experience to how businesses think about growth and resilience.\\n\\n#### **What’s Driving These Trends: Three Forces**\\n\\nIn 2025, you'll see the impact of**three key forces reflected in every trend related to cloud technology.**\\n\\n1.   **Intelligent Automation**: AI is no longer an add-on. It’s being baked into orchestration, monitoring, optimization, and even security policy enforcement.\\n2.   **Architectural Distribution**: Workloads are spreading across providers, regions, edge nodes, and APIs. Complexity is the norm, not the exception.\\n3.   **Business-Specific Alignment**: Organizations want platforms that speak their language—whether that’s financial compliance, healthcare data interoperability, or energy grid resilience.\\n\\nUnderstanding these drivers makes it easier to see how each trend fits not just into a technical roadmap, but a**strategic shift in how digital infrastructure enables growth and resilience**.\\n\\n1.   #### **Cloud + AI: Smarter Platforms, Not Just Smarter Apps**\\n\\nAI is no longer just powering applications—it’s becoming part of the cloud itself. Cloud-native platforms are embedding intelligence into their infrastructure, automating tasks like performance tuning, anomaly detection, and cost forecasting.\\n\\nA clear example is infrastructure scaling. Where teams previously had to manually monitor usage and adjust resources, AI models can now anticipate spikes and adjust capacity proactively, reducing latency and operational effort.\\n\\nTechnologies behind this trend include AI-infused monitoring tools like Datadog with Watchdog, AIOps platforms like Moogsoft, and services like AWS Auto Scaling or Google’s Active Assist.\\n\\nThese systems allow cloud environments to adapt in real time, making performance tuning and cost controls far more dynamic than traditional approaches.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Lack of transparency:** AI decisions can feel like black boxes to operations teams.\\n*   **Trust and control:** Not all organizations are ready to hand over critical infrastructure tasks.\\n*   **Oversight complexity:** Teams must validate that automation aligns with business goals.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nBy shifting intelligence deeper into the stack, organizations gain a self-optimizing foundation that scales smarter, recovers faster, and reduces human intervention, critical as cloud environments grow in scale and complexity.\\n\\n1.   #### **Vertical Cloud Platforms: One Size No Longer Fits All**\\n\\nGeneral-purpose clouds are not always ideal for regulated industries or domains with unique data formats and compliance needs. That’s where vertical cloud platforms come in—tailored for sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.\\n\\nTake Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare. It integrates compliance standards (like HIPAA), patient engagement tools, and healthcare-specific APIs into one pre-packaged environment, helping providers innovate without reinventing regulatory frameworks.\\n\\nThis shift is supported by industry-specific platforms like Google Cloud for Financial Services or Salesforce Industries, and compliance tools like Vanta or Drata that integrate directly into cloud environments.\\n\\nOf course, this often means less customization flexibility and a tighter dependency on the vendor’s roadmap. But for many organizations, that’s a worthwhile trade-off for speed and assurance.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Vendor dependency:** Organizations trade flexibility for speed and compliance.\\n*   **Limited customization:** You get what’s offered—custom builds can be constrained.\\n*   **Cost premium:** Vertical platforms often come with higher price tags.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nVertical clouds reduce friction in heavily regulated or complex industries—accelerating time to value, simplifying compliance, and enabling faster digital transformation without reinventing the wheel.\\n\\n1.   #### **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid: Flexibility Now Comes First**\\n\\nToday, most organizations operate in a multi-cloud or hybrid setup, using different cloud environments for different needs. One might handle analytics in one provider and user authentication in another.\\n\\nWhat once was a risk-management tactic has become a performance and flexibility strategy. Managing this complexity has gotten easier thanks to modern orchestration tools and a shift toward open, interoperable standards.\\n\\nConsider a global logistics firm that uses AWS for IoT tracking, Azure for internal systems, and Google Cloud for its machine learning pipelines. Interoperability is managed through orchestration tools, not manual workarounds.\\n\\nKey technologies enabling this trend include Terraform, Kubernetes, HashiCorp Consul, Google Anthos, and hybrid tools like Azure Arc or AWS Outposts.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Increased complexity:** Different clouds mean varied APIs, SLAs, and billing.\\n*   **Integration friction:** Without careful orchestration, systems may become silos.\\n*   **Skill gaps:** Teams must understand multiple platforms to operate effectively.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nIn a rapidly changing and performance-driven world, resilience and adaptability are more crucial. Multi-cloud is no longer a hedge—it’s a competitive advantage when managed strategically.\\n\\n1.   #### **Edge + Serverless: A Shift Toward Event-Driven, Low-Latency Architecture**\\n\\nFor applications that require real-time responsiveness—like connected vehicles, industrial automation, or augmented retail—latency matters. That’s where edge computing comes in, bringing compute power closer to where data is generated.\\n\\nPair that with serverless architecture, and you get highly responsive, event-driven systems where developers write logic, not infrastructure. The platform handles provisioning, scaling, and execution behind the scenes.\\n\\nA good example is Chick-fil-A, which uses Kubernetes clusters deployed at its stores to process real-time ordering data locally, improving responsiveness even during network disruptions.\\n\\nThis trend is powered by technologies like Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda@Edge, Azure Functions, and serverless frameworks such as OpenFaaS or Netlify.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Monitoring difficulty:** Distributed functions are harder to trace and debug.\\n*   **Cold start latency:** Not all serverless platforms are fast enough for real-time apps.\\n*   **Vendor lock-in:** Serverless services often tie you deeply into one cloud ecosystem.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nFor businesses building responsive, intelligent systems—from AI at the edge to real-time personalization—this architecture provides the speed, scale, and simplicity needed to meet modern expectations.\\n\\n1.   #### **Zero-Trust Security: Security Built Into Everything**\\n\\nTraditional perimeter-based security no longer fits today’s cloud-native world. Zero-trust security assumes no user, device, or application should be trusted by default.\\n\\nThis model validates every access attempt dynamically, based on user role, device posture, and contextual risk. It emphasizes strong identity management, encryption, and micro-segmentation.\\n\\nAdopting zero-trust can be complex, but it’s increasingly necessary in systems built on APIs, distributed teams, and third-party services.\\n\\nGoogle pioneered this approach internally with BeyondCorp, and today, tools like Zscaler, Okta, and Microsoft Entra ID help enterprises roll it out across environments.\\n\\nZero-trust combines dynamic access policies, encrypted data flows, identity federation, and continuous monitoring.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Cultural shift:** Zero-trust requires buy-in from both security and development teams.\\n*   **Identity sprawl:** Managing multiple identities across providers is complex.\\n*   **Integration effort:** Retrofitting legacy systems can be a slow, costly process.\\n\\nImplementation can be complex. It requires culture change, clear identity governance, and integration across layers. But the payoff is a fundamentally more secure, breach-resilient posture.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nZero-trust isn’t just about protecting against breaches—it’s about ensuring systems are safe by default. In cloud-native environments, it’s quickly becoming the standard, not an option.\\n\\n1.   #### **Developer Experience: Making Cloud Easy for Developers**\\n\\nAs development speed becomes a competitive advantage, cloud platforms are shifting their focus from raw compute to empowering builders.\\n\\nGreat developer experience means intuitive tools, fast feedback loops, and minimal friction. AI-assisted coding, integrated CI/CD, and low-code platforms are reshaping how software gets built and shipped.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Tool Overload**: Too many tools can overwhelm developers.\\n*   **Consistency**: Ensuring consistent environments across development and production.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nGreat developer experience leads to faster innovation. Investing here means more resilient teams and shorter paths from concept to production.\\n\\n1.   #### **AI-Led Cloud Optimization: Automating Efficiency and Control**\\n\\nCloud operations generate vast volumes of data, and AI is helping teams turn that data into decisions. Instead of just reporting usage, AI tools now suggest or even automate changes to improve cost-efficiency and resource use.\\n\\nThey can help right-size workloads, shut down idle resources, and forecast upcoming demand. In some cases, this optimization happens automatically, within guardrails defined by the organization.\\n\\nStill, human oversight remains important. Teams need to ensure these optimizations align with performance goals and business needs, not just cost savings.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Data Quality**: AI models require accurate data to make effective decisions.\\n*   **Over-Reliance**: Dependence on AI without human oversight can lead to issues.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nAs cloud usage increases, so do operational costs. AI helps businesses shift from reactive cost-cutting to proactive, data-driven optimization.\\n\\n1.   #### **Composable Cloud Services: Build Like Blocks, Not Stacks**\\n\\nOrganizations are moving away from rigid, monolithic cloud stacks toward**modular, composable architectures**, where cloud services are selected, integrated, and deployed like building blocks.\\n\\nFor example, a modern retail company might use Stripe for payment processing, Azure OpenAI for real-time personalization, and Fastly for edge delivery—all seamlessly stitched together through standardized APIs and managed contracts.\\n\\nThis approach is driven by principles like API-first development, micro-frontends, and infrastructure-as-code. Key enablers include tools like API gateways (e.g., Kong, Apigee), service meshes, and infrastructure-as-code frameworks like Pulumi and Terraform. These tools allow teams to define, deploy, and scale services independently, with guardrails in place.\\n\\nThe result? Faster experimentation, lower lock-in, and greater agility at scale.\\n\\n**Challenges to Consider**\\n\\n*   **Service sprawl**: More components mean more operational overhead.\\n*   **Contract drift**: Keeping service APIs in sync across updates is essential.\\n*   **Observability**: Uniform monitoring across distributed services requires strong governance.\\n\\n**Why it matters:**\\n\\nComposable services give teams flexibility without fragmentation. In a fast-changing market, being able to assemble—and reassemble—solutions quickly is a strategic edge.\\n\\n#### **How do These Trends Vary by Industry?**\\n\\nCloud innovations don’t impact all industries equally. Each sector faces its own set of challenges that shape how these trends are adopted and prioritized.\\n\\n**Healthcare:**\\n\\nThe healthcare sector’s top priority is secure, compliant data sharing across disparate systems. Vertical cloud platforms designed specifically for healthcare enable seamless data interoperability while ensuring HIPAA compliance. These specialized clouds provide built-in safeguards and audit controls, speeding up the adoption of AI-powered diagnostics and telemedicine without risking patient privacy.\\n\\n**Manufacturing:**\\n\\nFor manufacturers, the edge is mission-critical. Real-time automation on factory floors depends on low-latency processing close to equipment, driving demand for edge computing paired with serverless architectures. These technologies enable predictive maintenance and dynamic supply chain adjustments. Hybrid cloud setups also allow manufacturers to keep sensitive IP on-premises while leveraging public clouds for analytics.\\n\\n**Finance:**\\n\\nFinancial firms balance rapid innovation with strict regulatory oversight. Low-latency AI models running on hybrid clouds help detect fraud and manage risks in real time. Vertical clouds tailored to finance provide compliance with standards like PCI-DSS and GDPR, offering pre-integrated controls. Multi-cloud strategies enable firms to isolate critical workloads while optimizing cost and resilience.\\n\\n**Retail**\\n\\nRetailers leverage composable cloud services and AI-driven personalization to enhance customer experiences both online and in stores. Real-time inventory management uses edge computing to sync data from physical locations instantly. Retail-focused vertical clouds incorporate compliance with consumer data protection laws and streamline integrations with payment and logistics providers.\\n\\n#### **Prioritizing Your Cloud Evolution: A Strategic Framework**\\n\\nWith diverse trends emerging, organizations must prioritize investments based on cloud maturity, industry demands, and strategic objectives.\\n\\n**For Early-Stage Cloud Adopters (0-2 years in cloud):**\\n\\nFocus on foundational capabilities that ensure flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in. Establish multi-cloud strategies and enhance developer productivity to accelerate delivery. Once stable, introduce automated cost management and initiate baseline zero-trust security to strengthen controls.\\n\\n**For Intermediate Cloud Users (2-5 years in cloud):**\\n\\nWith some experience and infrastructure already in place, this is where strategy becomes more industry-specific. A healthcare provider might explore vertical clouds tailored to regulatory needs. A digital commerce team may turn to composable services to increase delivery speed and customization.\\n\\nAs operational maturity grows, explore edge computing and AI-driven optimization to boost responsiveness and efficiency.\\n\\n**For Advanced Cloud Organizations (5+ years, cloud-native):**\\n\\nAt this stage, cloud computing is fully integrated into the core business model, serving as a key driver of competitive differentiation. Artificial intelligence is embedded across operations rather than being an isolated capability. Edge computing is leveraged extensively to optimize latency-sensitive processes, while composable architectures provide the agility to adjust and scale in response to evolving business needs rapidly.\\n\\nHowever, organizations at this level continuously evaluate emerging trends and innovations to maintain their leadership, focusing on resilience, continuous improvement, and automated governance across increasingly complex environments.\\n\\n**Industry-Specific Priorities:**\\n\\n*   **Healthcare & Finance:** Prioritize vertical cloud platforms and comprehensive zero-trust security frameworks to ensure compliance and protect sensitive data.\\n*   **Manufacturing & Logistics:** Emphasize edge computing and hybrid cloud strategies to enable real-time automation and safeguard proprietary information.\\n*   **Retail & Digital-First Businesses:** Focus on composable services and enhancing developer experience to accelerate innovation and improve customer engagement.\\n\\n#### **From Trends to Action: Turning Insight into Impact**\\n\\nUnderstanding cloud trends is just the first step. Forward-looking organizations are transforming those insights into strategic action, rethinking governance, budgets, skills, and alignment to build a future-ready cloud practice.\\n\\n**Key Actions for Leading Teams**\\n\\n1.   **Rewrite governance for multi-cloud reality:** Instead of single-cloud policies, develop framework-based governance that works across providers. Start by creating cloud-agnostic security policies, establishing consistent tagging standards, and implementing unified monitoring across all environments. Practically, this means replacing vendor-specific compliance checklists with outcome-based controls that apply regardless of which cloud services you use.\\n2.   **Adopt adaptive FinOps:** Move beyond monthly cost reports to real-time financial optimization. Begin by implementing automated cost anomaly detection, establishing resource tagging standards for accurate cost allocation, and creating self-service cost dashboards for development teams. The goal is shifting from \\\"How much did we spend?\\\" to \\\"How can we optimize value while controlling costs dynamically?\\\"\\n3.   **Reskill teams for AI-native operations:** Invest in training that goes beyond traditional cloud administration. Focus on AI-assisted development tools, automated testing frameworks, and observability platforms that provide intelligent insights rather than just data. Start with pilot programs where select team members learn these tools, then scale successful approaches across your organization.\\n4.   **Align cloud with product strategy:** Integrate cloud architectural decisions directly into product planning cycles. This means cloud architects should attend product roadmap meetings, infrastructure capabilities should influence feature prioritization, and cloud investments should be justified by product outcomes, not just operational efficiency. Create shared success metrics that connect cloud performance to business results.\\n\\n**Concrete First Steps by Trend**\\n\\n1.   **For AI-Driven Platforms**: Audit your current monitoring tools and identify three manual processes that could be automated. Start with simple anomaly detection on critical services.\\n2.   **For Zero-Trust Security**: Begin with identity consolidation—catalog all your current identity providers and create a migration plan to reduce complexity by 50%.\\n3.   **For Edge Computing**: Identify your most latency-sensitive user interactions and measure current response times. These become your baseline for edge computing ROI calculations.\\n4.   **For Vertical Clouds**: If you're in a regulated industry, audit your current compliance processes and identify which take the most time. These are prime candidates for vertical cloud migration.\\n\\nIf your conversations still start with tooling, it may be time to zoom out and ask:_**What outcomes are we optimizing for?**_ That’s where these trends become not just interesting, but transformative.\\n\\n**Remember, if your cloud strategy hasn’t changed in two years, it’s already lagging.**Now is the moment to audit your architecture, tooling, and team readiness, ensuring you’re positioned not just to keep pace but to lead in innovation, growth, and security.\\n\\nTags \\n\\nCloudOptimo Cloud Computing Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Trends 2025 Cloud Innovation Cloud Strategy\\n\\n#### Free Cloud Assessment\\n\\nName \\n\\nBusiness Email* \\n\\nLet's connect\\n\\n[Previous Detecting Orphaned Resources Using AWS Config Rules](https://www.cloudoptimo.com/blog/detecting-orphaned-resources-using-aws-config-rules/)\\n\\n[Next ETL vs ELT in Cloud Data Stacks: Key Differences and Best Use Cases](https://www.cloudoptimo.com/blog/etl-vs-elt-in-cloud-data-stacks-key-differences-and-best-use-cases/)\\n\\nSimilar Blogs\\n-------------\\n\\n[![Image 20: blog-image](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/Mastering_AWS_Transit_Gateway_Architecture_Use_Cases_and_Best_Practices_bfabe97b32.jpg) ### Mastering AWS Transit Gateway: Architecture, Use Cases & Best Practices Subhendu Nayak Apr 14, 2025 AWS Transit Gateway is a highly scalable and flexible service that simplifies network architectures by providing centralized connectivity for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks and on-premises networks.

Both methods involve similar steps—extraction from a source, transformation of the data, and loading into a destination—but the order in which these steps occur changes how they perform, scale, and integrate with infrastructure. Historically, ETL emerged in the era of on-premise data warehouses. It was designed to perform data transformation before loading, often using external compute engines or middleware. ELT, by contrast, gained popularity with the rise of cloud-native data warehouses that could scale compute and storage independently. In ELT, raw data is loaded first, and transformations are executed inside the destination system—typically a cloud data platform like Snowflake or BigQuery.

Whether you run an e-commerce site, a streaming platform, or a global app, fast and reliable content delivery is critical. CloudFront, Cloudflare, and Akamai aim to deliver performance, but their approaches and strengths differ. This blog highlights what sets each apart, helping you choose the CDN that fits your audience and infrastructure. A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a globally distributed system of servers that caches and delivers content, such as images, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, videos, APIs, or even dynamic data, from the location nearest to the end user. By serving content from a server closer to the user, CDNs improve website speed, reduce latency, and provide a better overall user experience.

It often requires high upfront investments, longer procurement cycles, and manual maintenance. Cloud-only models provide agility, elasticity, and managed services. However, they can face limitations due to data residency requirements, latency-sensitive applications, and integration with legacy systems. These limitations have made way for hybrid cloud models that combine both environments' strengths. Hybrid cloud is no longer a transitional state; it is a strategic architectural model. AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operational models to virtually any on-premises facility. This enables consistent development, deployment, and management across cloud and on-prem environments.

In AWS, these so-called orphaned resources can quietly drive up costs, pose security risks, and increase operational complexity if left unchecked. This blog explores how to identify and manage orphaned resources using AWS Config, a service designed to continuously assess, audit, and evaluate AWS resource configurations. We'll start by understanding what orphaned resources are, why they matter, and how AWS Config plays a critical role in detecting them. From there, we'll move step-by-step through configuring AWS Config, leveraging managed and custom rules, setting up automations, handling challenges, and learning from real-world examples.

Back in 2020, the cloud was primarily a lifeline: a tool for business continuity, remote access, and scaling under pressure. But now, that baseline capability is expected. The conversation has shifted from “Can we run in the cloud?” to “How intelligently and securely can we run in the cloud?” What’s emerging is a more strategic, nuanced approach. Organizations are looking beyond raw infrastructure to platforms that help them move faster, make smarter decisions, and align more tightly with business goals. Complexity is growing—but so is opportunity. Recent data underscores this transformation. According to Gartner, by the end of 2025, over 70% of enterprises will have adopted industry cloud platforms to accelerate business initiatives. IDC reports that 80% of global enterprises will prioritize intelligence and automation in their IT investments by mid-decade.

It often requires high upfront investments, longer procurement cycles, and manual maintenance. Cloud-only models provide agility, elasticity, and managed services. However, they can face limitations due to data residency requirements, latency-sensitive applications, and integration with legacy systems. These limitations have made way for hybrid cloud models that combine both environments' strengths. Hybrid cloud is no longer a transitional state; it is a strategic architectural model. AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operational models to virtually any on-premises facility. This enables consistent development, deployment, and management across cloud and on-prem environments.

In AWS, these so-called orphaned resources can quietly drive up costs, pose security risks, and increase operational complexity if left unchecked. This blog explores how to identify and manage orphaned resources using AWS Config, a service designed to continuously assess, audit, and evaluate AWS resource configurations. We'll start by understanding what orphaned resources are, why they matter, and how AWS Config plays a critical role in detecting them. From there, we'll move step-by-step through configuring AWS Config, leveraging managed and custom rules, setting up automations, handling challenges, and learning from real-world examples.

Back in 2020, the cloud was primarily a lifeline: a tool for business continuity, remote access, and scaling under pressure. But now, that baseline capability is expected. The conversation has shifted from “Can we run in the cloud?” to “How intelligently and securely can we run in the cloud?” What’s emerging is a more strategic, nuanced approach. Organizations are looking beyond raw infrastructure to platforms that help them move faster, make smarter decisions, and align more tightly with business goals. Complexity is growing—but so is opportunity. Recent data underscores this transformation. According to Gartner, by the end of 2025, over 70% of enterprises will have adopted industry cloud platforms to accelerate business initiatives. IDC reports that 80% of global enterprises will prioritize intelligence and automation in their IT investments by mid-decade.

Both methods involve similar steps—extraction from a source, transformation of the data, and loading into a destination—but the order in which these steps occur changes how they perform, scale, and integrate with infrastructure. Historically, ETL emerged in the era of on-premise data warehouses. It was designed to perform data transformation before loading, often using external compute engines or middleware. ELT, by contrast, gained popularity with the rise of cloud-native data warehouses that could scale compute and storage independently. In ELT, raw data is loaded first, and transformations are executed inside the destination system—typically a cloud data platform like Snowflake or BigQuery.

A single hour of server downtime can lead to losses of $300,000 or more for 93% of SMEs and large enterprises.\\n\\n## Cloud Cost Optimization Trends\\n\\nCloud cost optimization helps manage and reduce cloud spending by implementing strategies like right-sizing, reserved instances, auto-scaling and cost monitoring, which ensure cost efficiency and maximize return on investment in cloud deployments. It helps balance the performance, security and cost of deployments to obtain maximum value from the investment.\\n\\nAccording to CloudZero, two-thirds of companies cannot accurately report unit costs. Over 40% can only estimate their cloud spend. The number of companies claiming cloud costs are too high has increased from 11% in 2022 to 14% in 2024, showing a lack of cost control. Public cloud spending is about 15% over budget, and 31% of organizations expect it to increase.\\n\\nHowever, it’s not all bad news. The estimated wasted cloud spend has decreased to 24% after reaching a high of 32% in 2022. According to Flexera, cost optimization is a top priority to about 59% of cloud users.\\n\\n### Pay-As-You-Go Cloud\\n\\nPay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing allows cloud users to only pay for the cloud resources they use. This enhances flexibility and scalability, allowing businesses to adjust their usage based on demand. Some of the trends supporting pay-as-you-go pricing include increased flexibility, hybrid cloud solutions and the development of serverless computing.\\n\\nThe pay-as-you-go pricing on public cloud is one of the drivers boosting the public cloud market, as it makes cloud resources more affordable for organizations. The 20.4% growth in public cloud spending will in 2024 in reference to 2023 can partly be attributed to the PAYG model in public cloud pricing.\\n\\n## Cloud Migration Trends\\n\\n[Cloud migration](https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-migration) entails moving data, applications and other businesses from an organization’s on-premises data centers to a cloud-based environment. This can involve transferring data to public clouds or private clouds, or implementing a hybrid solution. Cloud migration improves performance, scalability and cost-efficiency while operating infrastructure workloads.\\n\\nCloud adoption is becoming more popular, with most organizations migrating part or all of their workloads to the cloud. Heavy cloud users now make up 71% of respondents, compared to 65% last year, according to the Flexera State of the Cloud 2024 Report.\\n\\nCompanies’ Cloud Usage\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Heavy Usage | 71 % |\\n| Moderate Usage | 15 % |\\n| Light Usage | 14 % |\\n\\nFurthermore, according to the Flexera survey, 29% of respondents — including both enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses — are spending more than $12 million a year, up from 29% last year. There is also a 21% increase in organizations spending more than $1 million a month on cloud computing, with most deploying their workloads in multicloud environments.\\n\\nMost businesses in all sectors and industries — including healthcare, BFSI, IT & telecommunications, government and public sector, among others — are moving their operations to the cloud to reap from the benefits of cloud operations.\\n\\n## What Are the Benefits of Adopting Cloud Computing?\\n\\nThe [benefits of cloud computing](https://www.cloudwards.net/benefits-of-cloud-computing) include cost efficiency, scalability, disaster recovery, improved performance and reliability, and simplified IT management.\\n\\n## What Are the Challenges of Adopting Cloud Computing?\\n\\nThe [challenges of cloud computing](https://www.cloudwards.net/challenges-of-cloud-computing) include security concerns, cost management, integration and compatibility, vendor lock-in and the need for technical skills and expertise.

Moreover, it strictly complies with the requirements outlined in the DoA Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (CSR).\\n\\n##### **Google Cloud for Government:**\\n\\nPowered by Google Cloud, Google Government offers solutions focused on data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine intelligence capabilities. These solutions serve as a toolkit for government agencies to make data-driven decisions, provide better citizen services, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance performance in the operations field.  \\nCloud adoption in government is increasing due to customized services and fine-tuning of cloud environments. Cloud service providers (CSPs) today offer the engine to modernize public sector operations with tailored solutions built with governments in mind. By delivering highly customized services to boost efficiency, security, and compliance, they help governments better serve citizens.\\n\\n### Meeting Unique Requirements\\n\\nGovernment agencies greatly rely on cloud service providers (CSPs), as they can offer customized solutions to the agency’s requirements. This includes VPN’s enhanced security features, strict regulation compliance to frameworks, and sovereign cloud services guaranteeing data residency and sovereignty.\\n\\n##### **Enhanced Security and Compliance Measures**\\n\\nGovernment entities are responsible for managing data that requires security measures and strict adherence to regulatory requirements. CSPs have developed specialized environments to meet these demands:\\n\\n*   **FedRAMP Compliance:** FedRAMP sets forth a method for evaluating and approving the security of offerings in the US through consistent monitoring and authorization processes. Cloud providers are required to meet security criteria to secure FedRAMP authorization for catering to government agencies.\\n*   **DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG):**  \\n    The Ministry of Defense has a definitive range of security requirements. Hence every CSP must comply with their Cloud Computing SRG. The Guide contains all the protocols and security controls necessary to manage and protect sensitive information.\\n\\n##### **Data Residency and Sovereignty**\\n\\nThe reason to have data located within national borders is usually government control and the need to follow local laws:\\n\\n*   **Data Localization:** For data privacy compliance with national data residency laws, CSPs offer options for where data may reside in a particular geography. Azure Data Residency options provided by Microsoft allow customers to express where to store their data.\\n*   **Sovereign Cloud Solutions:** Some CSPs offer sovereign cloud services, which provide controls that physically and logically separate them from other clouds. With this data, governments have greater control of their own data. These solutions guarantee that the data is confined to a specific jurisdiction, satisfies local regulations, and manages data sovereignty.\\n\\n##### **Customized Solutions for Government Needs**\\n\\nCloud Service Providers (CSPs) develop specialized services tailored to the specific demands of government operations:\\n\\n*   **Dedicated Government Cloud Platforms:** Microsoft Azure Government and AWS GovCloud are providers that provide a trusted environment for government agencies only. These environments are under regulatory standards, which provide more fabulous security features.\\n*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** These platforms are also designed for scalability and can handle varying workloads, ensuring successful cloud adoption in government.\\n\\n### Interoperability and Integration\\n\\nEnsuring that cloud services can seamlessly integrate with existing government systems is crucial:\\n\\n*   **API Support:** Therefore, CSPs come with robust Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for subsequent integration with legacy systems, thus making a smooth transition to cloud operation.\\n*   **Hybrid Cloud Solutions:** Firstly, hybrid cloud is the context in which many providers provide for governments to run certain operations in-house but use cloud services for the rest, such that there will be flexibility and control.\\n\\n### Compliance with International Standards\\n\\nGovernments often need to adhere to international regulations and standards:\\n\\n*   **ISO Certifications:** ISO/IEC 27001 is the industry standard for information security management. CSPs use it to secure their information systems and attest to Information security management according to best global practices.\\n*   **GDPR Compliance:** They ensure that the General Data Protection Regulation is adhered to and that citizen data is secure within European Union countries.\\n\\nBy enabling a larger group of CSPs to offer a standard suite of on-the-shelf or managed cloud services, the cloud provides government agencies with the means to leverage cloud power to meet their unique security, compliance, and data sovereignty requirements while continuing to do this for CSPs.\\n\\nChallenges Governments Face in Adopting Cloud\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe use of cloud technologies to develop applications has its own issues for government agencies, including data security, complexity in migration, and cost. Addressing these challenges is very important to successfully integrate the cloud and increase the ratio of cloud adoption in government.\\n\\n### Key Challenges:\\n\\n**1\\\\. Data Security and Compliance:** Sensitive information is protected, and regulatory standards are adhered to. The safety of citizen data is a complex compliance requirement that agencies must navigate.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Migration from Legacy Systems:** Data transfer can be complicated, and in some cases, service disruptions can occur when you move from outdated infrastructure to cloud platforms.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Budget Constraints and Resource Allocation:** Cloud adoption efforts can be limited by limited financial resources and the requirement to allocate them strategically. However, balancing costs while reaching modernization goals is a big hurdle.\\n\\n### Solutions:\\n\\n**1\\\\. Hybrid Cloud Models:** Hybrid cloud strategies are implemented to allow for a phased migration. Agencies can hand off certain operations to the cloud while leaving those that cannot currently be on-premise. This minimizes risks and smoothens the transition.\\n\\n**2\\\\. Built-in Compliance Tools:** Cloud service providers can provide tools for adherence to regulatory standards, which can be utilized. These tools support monitoring and servicing your compliance requirements efficiently.\\n\\n**3\\\\. Cost Optimization Strategies:** Agencies can use the pay-as-you-go pricing model and cost management tools to optimize expenditure. Observing this approach allows the resources to be allocated at a low budget.\\n\\nGovernment agencies can address the complexity of cloud adoption with targeted solutions to address these challenges, improving both the service delivery of that agency and the operational efficiency overall.\\n\\nFuture Trends in Government Cloud Adoption\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe rising pace of cloud adoption in Government is at the verge of evolution and setting new trends with enough potential to revolutionize how governments connect and operate with or for citizens.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\\n\\nAI and Machine Learning algorithms have taken over and are becoming increasingly dominant in government, making it imperative for them to deploy cloud-based AI and Machine Learning tools to automate processes and accelerate decision-making speed.

CONCLUSION](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_Toc192691082)\\n\\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nCongress’s continued failure to pass a comprehensive privacy law left the states—as well as federal agencies—to keep leading the charge in defining and regulating cybersecurity and privacy in the United States. The states embraced this charge in 2024—seven states enacted new comprehensive privacy laws, and four states’ comprehensive privacy laws took effect. With 11 new comprehensive privacy laws slated to take effect in 2025 and 2026, 20 states and approximately half of the U.S. population will be covered by a state comprehensive privacy law by 2026. While the newly enacted laws generally follow a similar framework and share common core requirements, important variations are starting to emerge, which threaten to further complicate the already heavy compliance burden for companies operating across state lines. At the same time, there was a growing emphasis on children’s online privacy and biometric data in 2024, and a number of states amended their existing comprehensive privacy law to reflect this focus. State regulators similarly pursued an aggressive enforcement agenda in 2024, with a notable focus on children’s data/social media, biometric data, and data brokers.\\n\\nThere was also significant legislative, rulemaking, and enforcement activity at the federal level in 2024. Notably, the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act (PADFAA), which prohibits data brokers from transferring American’s sensitive personal data to certain foreign countries, was enacted and went into effect in 2024. In addition, numerous federal agencies—including the FTC, SEC, CFPB, DOJ, and HHS—promulgated privacy and data protection regulations and guidance on a range of issues, including children’s online privacy, biometric data, health data, location data, data brokers/national security, and cybersecurity incident disclosure, among other issues. Many federal agencies also brought enforcement actions against companies for alleged privacy, data security, and related violations.\\n\\nWhile we expect some of these trends to continue in 2025 and beyond, particularly at the state level, the Trump administration’s early policy changes—defined by deregulation of the technology industry, removal of what some consider historical barriers to innovation, and a reversal of Biden-era policies related to content moderation, AI and digital assets, among other things—signal a significant shift at the federal level that will inevitably shape state policy and enforcement priorities.\\n\\nLitigation likewise remained active in 2024, with a continued uptick in claims by private litigants and government entities related to data breaches, federal and state wiretapping laws, and state biometrics laws. Litigation is expected to continue in these areas in 2025.\\n\\nThis Review contextualizes these and other 2024 developments by addressing: (1) the regulation of privacy and data security, other legislative developments, enforcement actions by federal and state authorities, and new regulatory guidance; (2) trends in civil litigation around data privacy and security in areas including data breach, wiretapping, biometrics, anti-hacking and computer intrusion statutes, and TCPA; and (3) trends related to data innovations and governmental data collection. Information on developments outside the United States—which are relevant to domestic and international companies alike—will be covered in detail by Gibson Dunn’s forthcoming International Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Outlook .\\n\\n**II. REGULATION OF PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY**\\n\\nThe state comprehensive data privacy law expansion trend continued in 2024, with seven states enacting new laws: Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maryland, Kentucky, and Rhode Island. Comprehensive data privacy laws took effect in four states in 2024: Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Montana. In 2025, another eight states—Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Maryland—will see their laws go into effect, and laws will take effect in three more states—Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island—in early 2026. At that point, the total number of effective comprehensive state privacy laws will be 20, just seven years after California enacted the trail-blazing California Consumer Privacy Act. In addition, at the time of this report, the Connecticut, Iowa, and Tennessee legislatures are in various states of amending their current laws and another 16 states are actively considering data privacy legislation, with drafting and negotiations in various phases, and states have continued to enact narrower sector-specific laws covering minors, biometric information, and health information. We discuss these laws below and highlight different states’ approaches to consumer rights.\\n\\nSome state governments have also demonstrated a commitment to enforcing their data privacy laws, and announced several significant enforcement actions in 2024. With the continued absence of comprehensive federal privacy legislation, we suspect that states will continue to actively enforce their respective privacy laws. We discuss state-level enforcement below in our [State Agencies section](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_Toc192691050).\\n\\n> **A. Regulation of Privacy and Data Security**\\n\\n> > **1. State Legislation and Related Regulations**\\n\\n> > > **a. New Comprehensive State Privacy Laws Passed in 2024**\\n\\nSince California enacted the first comprehensive state privacy law in 2018, 19 other states have followed suit with their own comprehensive privacy legislation. The pace of legislation has accelerated in recent years—while only five states enacted privacy laws between 2018-2022, eight enacted laws in 2023, and seven more in 2024. Currently, 16 other states are also considering privacy legislation: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia.\\n\\nThe seven state privacy laws enacted in 2024—Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maryland, Kentucky, and Rhode Island—generally share the same basic requirements, providing consumers with rights to access, correct and delete their personal data, and opt out of targeted advertising, profiling, and the sale of personal data. Although these core elements remain consistent, certain states have introduced unique provisions. We discuss the state laws passed in 2024 that will go into effect in 2025 in more detail below. For analysis of comprehensive privacy laws that took effect in 2024 (including Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Montana), please refer to [last year’s review](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-outlook-and-review-2024/).\\n\\n> > > **b. Comprehensive State Privacy Laws Becoming Effective in 2025**\\n\\nA few months into 2025, comprehensive state privacy laws for five states—Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and New Jersey—have already gone into effect with three more—Tennessee, Maryland and Minnesota—coming online later this year. While these laws are largely coextensive with existing comprehensive privacy laws, they also contain distinguishing features, which we summarize below. Nebraska’s and New Hampshire’s laws are substantially similar to existing state privacy laws, so we do not summarize those.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nThe Delaware Personal Privacy Act for the most part aligns with other states’ laws, but notably does not provide entity-level exemptions for institutions of higher education or most nonprofit organizations, unless the nonprofit provides services to victims or witnesses of child abuse, domestic violence, human trafficking, sexual assault, violent felony, or stalking.[[1]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn1)\\n\\nDelaware—along with Minnesota (discussed below) and Oregon—also requires that, as part of a consumer access request, data controllers disclose to the consumer the list of specific third parties, rather than just the categories of third parties, to which a business has disclosed that consumer’s personal data.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act differs from other comprehensive state privacy laws by omitting several widely adopted consumer rights.[[2]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn2) Iowa does not mandate data protection assessments for processing activities involving “heightened risk of harm to consumers,” which sets it apart from every other state except for Utah, which also does not have this requirement.[[3]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn3) Consumers also lack the right to opt out of processing for targeted advertising and profiling. They do, however, have the right to opt out of the sale of personal data. Iowa also diverges from most states in the manner it requires consent to collect and process sensitive data.[[4]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn4) The common practice is for controllers to obtain opt-in consent, but Iowa requires pre-use notice with an opportunity for consumers to opt out prior to having their data collected. This approach is distinctly controller-friendly, setting the default presumption that controllers can collect sensitive consumer data unless the consumer takes action to opt out.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nMaryland’s Online Data Privacy Act, which will take effect in October 2025, has some of the strictest requirements in the country.[[5]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn5) It is the only state to prohibit the sale of sensitive personal information entirely. With respect to minors, Maryland prohibits the sale of their personal information and the processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.[[6]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn6) Maryland defines a minor as anyone under the age of 18, as compared to 16 and under in California’s and Virginia’s comprehensive data privacy laws (among others). And, unlike other states, Maryland extends this obligation to any business that “knew _or should have known_” the consumer’s age. Other states, like Texas and Connecticut, require actual knowledge or willful disregard of the consumer’s age.[[7]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn7)\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nMost states give consumers the right to opt out of automated processing that furthers a significant decision (such as an employment decision), but, with its Consumer Data Privacy Act, Minnesota is the first state to offer consumers the right to _question_ these decisions.[[8]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn8) Minnesota’s right to question includes the ability to: (1) know the reason behind the decision, (2) know what actions the consumer might have taken to secure a different decision in the future, (3) review the personal data used, and (4) correct inaccurate personal data and have the decision reevaluated. As businesses become more reliant on automated programs to assist in decisionmaking, this “right to question” will be a unique area of compliance that companies operating in Minnesota will have to be ready for.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nWith the New Jersey Data Privacy Law, which we also covered in last year’s update, New Jersey joins California and Colorado in the small group of states that grants rulemaking authority to a state agency.[[9]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn9) New Jersey’s privacy law authorizes its director of the Division of Consumer Affairs to promulgate implementing regulations under Senate Bill 332, allowing the state agency to create rules to better carry out the law’s intended purpose. The state agency has not yet proposed any regulations under this authorization.\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act, while largely similar to other comprehensive state privacy laws, is unique in that it recognizes an affirmative defense to a violation.[[10]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn10) If a data controller either maintains and complies with a written policy that aligns with the National Institute of Standards and Technology privacy framework or has documented policies designed to safeguard consumer privacy, it may avail itself of this defense.[[11]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn11)\\n\\n> > > **c. State Privacy Frameworks and Trends**\\n\\nThe recent wave of state privacy legislation shows that most states are converging on core obligations, but meaningful divides on specific issues are also emerging. This section examines some of the most important distinctions between state privacy laws and their implications for compliance.\\n\\n> > > > **i. Enforcement and Rulemaking Authority**\\n\\nAll state privacy laws, except California, grant enforcement authority solely to the state attorney general, prohibiting private citizens from filing lawsuits. To date, public actions have only been filed in California and Texas, although other state Attorneys General continue to serve non-public violation notices, requests for information, or civil investigative demands, and this is expected to increase as more state laws go into effect.\\n\\nOnly three states—California, Colorado, and New Jersey—have empowered state agencies to issue regulations related to their respective privacy laws.[[12]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn12) While California and Colorado have already issued regulations, New Jersey only recently empowered its Division of Consumer Affairs within the Department of Law and Public Safety to do so. Unlike California and Colorado, New Jersey did not set a deadline for passing regulations, making it uncertain whether and when the state will exercise its rulemaking authority.\\n\\n> > > > **ii. Scope of Automated Decisionmaking Regulations**\\n\\nAll states with privacy laws (except Utah and Iowa) allow consumers to opt out of certain forms of automated decisionmaking. States typically define automated decisionmaking as the processing of personal information to analyze or predict personal aspects such as health or behavior in furtherance of a significant decision.[[13]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn13) Some states restrict this right to “solely” automated decisionmaking, while others provide the right to opt out of automated decisionmaking more broadly. The statutory scope of these opt out rights will become increasingly important as businesses roll out new automated processing tools.\\n\\n**Opt-out right for “solely” automated decisionmaking[**[14]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn14)****Opt-out right for automated decisionmaking[**[15]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn15)****No opt-out right[**[16]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn16)**\\nConnecticut\\n\\n Delaware\\n\\n Florida\\n\\n Indiana\\n\\n Maryland\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n New Hampshire\\n\\n Rhode Island\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Texas California*[[17]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn17)\\n\\n Colorado\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Minnesota\\n\\n New Jersey\\n\\n Oregon\\n\\n Virginia Iowa\\n\\n Utah\\n\\nDefinition of “Sale”\\n\\nEvery state with privacy laws imposes obligations on businesses that “sell” personal information. Some states define the “sale” of data as an exchange for “monetary or other valuable consideration,” while others define sale as an exchange for “monetary consideration” only.\\n\\nThese differences can have major impacts, particularly for businesses that participate in marketing cooperatives or other similar organizations that provide services in exchange for data, rather than payment.\\n\\n**Monetary or other valuable consideration[**[18]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn18)****Monetary consideration only[**[19]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn19)**\\nCalifornia\\n\\n Colorado\\n\\n Connecticut\\n\\n Delaware\\n\\n Florida\\n\\n Maryland\\n\\n Minnesota\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n New Hampshire\\n\\n New Jersey\\n\\n Oregon\\n\\n Rhode Island\\n\\n Texas Indiana\\n\\n Iowa\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Utah\\n\\n Virginia\\n\\nChildren\\n\\nSince the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was enacted in 1998, state privacy law has generally considered children’s data to be sensitive data subject to the COPPA Rule’s requirement that businesses must obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13 years old.[[20]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn20)\\n\\nHowever, in recent years, many state laws have expanded their youth privacy protections to include heightened opt-in consent requirements for teenagers under the age of 16, requiring businesses to get affirmative consent for targeted advertising or the sale of data. New Jersey and Minnesota extend the opt-in requirement to those under 17, and Delaware extends it to age 18.\\n\\nMaryland goes further than any other state by prohibiting targeted advertising and the sale of data entirely if a business “knew or should have known” that the individual is under 18.\\n\\n**Opt-in consent for sale of data or targeted advertising (for children under 16 years old)[**[21]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn21)****Opt-in consent for sale of data, targeted advertising, _and profiling_ (for children under 16 years old)[**[22]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn22)****No targeted advertising or sale of data[**[23]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn23)****No age-specific provisions[**[24]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn24)**\\nCalifornia\\n\\n Connecticut\\n\\n Delaware (<18)\\n\\n Minnesota (<17)\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n New Hampshire New Jersey (<17)\\n\\n Oregon Maryland (<18)Colorado\\n\\n Florida\\n\\n Indiana\\n\\n Iowa\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n Rhode Island\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Texas\\n\\n Utah\\n\\n Virginia\\n\\n> > > > **iii. Consumer Rights**\\n\\nAlthough most states offer consumers the right to opt out of targeted advertising and the right to access and delete their data, many states provide additional consumer protections.\\n\\nMost states require businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms, such as the Global Privacy Control. Universal opt-out mechanisms allow consumers to opt out of personal data sales and targeted advertising automatically, rather than adjusting their preferences on a site-by-site basis.\\n\\nBy the end of January 2026, 11 states will require controllers to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms. California, Colorado, Delaware, Montana, Nebraska, and Texas currently have an active requirement. New Jersey, Minnesota, and Maryland will require controllers to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms in the second half of 2025, followed by Connecticut and Oregon in January 2026.\\n\\nMost laws require businesses to disclose the “categories” of third parties that receive consumer information (for example, advertisers or payment processors). Delaware, Minnesota, and Oregon, however, require businesses to disclose a list of _specific_ third parties in response to an access request. In Rhode Island, no request is necessary—a business is required to post the list of specific third parties in a conspicuous location on its website.\\n\\nDelaware and New Jersey are notable for being the only two states that require businesses to actually delete information after receiving a consumer request to delete.[[25]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn25) Most states allow data to be kept if it is de-identified or removed from non-exempt use cases.[[26]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn26)\\n\\n**States with requirement****States without requirement**\\n**Universal opt-out mechanism[**[27]**](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn27)**California\\n\\n Colorado\\n\\n Connecticut\\n\\n Delaware\\n\\n Maryland\\n\\n Minnesota\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n New Hampshire\\n\\n New Jersey\\n\\n Oregon\\n\\n Texas Florida\\n\\n Indiana\\n\\n Iowa\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Rhode Island\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Utah\\n\\n Virginia\\nResponse to right to access must include a list of “**specific third parties**” that have received the consumer’s personal data[[28]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn28)Delaware\\n\\n Minnesota\\n\\n Oregon\\n\\n Rhode Island (must be posted publicly)California\\n\\n Colorado\\n\\n Connecticut\\n\\n Florida\\n\\n Indiana\\n\\n Iowa\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Maryland\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n New Hampshire\\n\\n New Jersey\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Texas\\n\\n Utah\\n\\n Virginia\\n**Actual deletion required on request** (not just de-identification or removal from non-exempt use cases)[[29]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn29)Delaware\\n\\n New Jersey California\\n\\n Colorado\\n\\n Connecticut\\n\\n Florida\\n\\n Indiana\\n\\n Iowa\\n\\n Kentucky\\n\\n Maryland\\n\\n Minnesota\\n\\n Montana\\n\\n Nebraska\\n\\n New Hampshire\\n\\n Oregon\\n\\n Rhode Island\\n\\n Tennessee\\n\\n Texas\\n\\n Utah\\n\\n Virginia\\n\\n> > **2.

Florida’s Online Protection for Minors Act**\\n\\nOn March 25, 2024, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis [signed legislation](https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2024/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-protect-children-and-uphold-parental-rights.) to ban social media platforms from allowing children aged 13 and under to create social media accounts. The law requires social media platforms to delete existing accounts for children under the age of 14, and allows minors who are 14 and 15 to have social media accounts only upon parental consent.[[30]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn30) The law is effective as of January 1, 2025.[[31]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn31)\\n\\nThe law also imposes a range of other restrictions. Websites that publish “material harmful to minors”—which generally refers to “obscene” materials, like pornography—must verify the age of the person attempting to access the material.[[32]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn32) Social media platforms must also verify the age of users, using “commercially reasonable method[s]” and conduct such age verification through an independent third party.[[33]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn33) These third parties may not retain or use personal identifying information for other purposes than age verification, and must anonymize and protect personal identifying information from unauthorized access.[[34]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn34)\\n\\nThe law [has been challenged](https://www.wlrn.org/2025-02-20/new-florida-law-aimed-at-curbing-kids-social-media-may-require-everyone-to-cough-up-their-id) by three internet-industry groups, which cite First Amendment concerns. According to these plaintiffs, the law is unconstitutional as it restricts minors’ access to speech and forces businesses to collect sensitive data.[[35]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn35) The law is currently paused from enforcement until a [preliminary injunction motion](https://www4.wng.org/Report-on-court-meeting.pdf) for one of the ongoing cases is resolved.[[36]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn36)\\n\\n> > > **b.

Under the Protecting Georgia’s Children on Social Media Act of 2024, social media companies are required to prevent minors, defined as those under 16 years old,[[37]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn37) from using their services without the “express consent” of a parent or guardian.[[38]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn38) Social media companies are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to verify the age of account holders.[[39]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn39) The law goes into effect on July 1 of this year.[[40]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn40)\\n\\nIn addition to the age verification requirements, social media companies must make available, upon a parent or guardian’s request, a list and description of features offered on their platforms that parents and guardians can utilize to censor or moderate content.[[41]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn41)\\n\\nRegarding minors’ personal data, social media platforms are prohibited from displaying any advertising to a minor based on their personal information, except age and location, and may not collect personal information from a minor’s posts, content, messages, text, or usage activities other than what is “adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for the purposes for which such information is collected.”[[42]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn42)\\n\\n> > > **c.

The law is effective as of October 1, 2024. The law defines “child” as any consumer under the age of 18.[[43]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn43) It requires companies that operate online products that are “reasonably likely to be accessed by children” to provide, upon request of the Division of Consumer Protection of the Office of the Attorney General, a data protection impact assessment that identifies the purpose of an online product, how it uses children’s data, and whether it is designed in a manner consistent with the best interests of children.[[44]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn44) “Best interests of children” refers to the reasonable foreseeability of material physical, financial, psychological, or emotional harm to children; a highly offensive intrusion on children’s reasonable expectation of privacy, or discrimination against children based on race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender identity, sex, or sexual orientation.[[45]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn45) The law also requires that these companies put in place default privacy settings that offer children a “high level of privacy,” restricting companies’ ability to profile minors or process unnecessary data.[[46]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn46)\\n\\nOn February 3, 2025, an internet-industry trade association [filed a complaint](https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/NetChoice-Maryland-Speech-Code-Complaint-file-stamped-2-3-2025.pdf) against the Maryland Attorney General, alleging that the Maryland Kids Code violated the First Amendment and 14th amendment. The plaintiff [remarked](https://marylandmatters.org/2025/02/03/social-media-companies-head-to-court-claim-maryland-kids-code-is-unconstitutional/) that the law “presents websites with an impossible choice: either proactively censor broad categories of constitutionally protected speech or force users to submit sensitive personal information.” The plaintiff also takes issue with the law’s data protection impact assessment, alleging a First Amendment violation for “compel[ling] speech in the form of a data impact statement.” It additionally argues that the “reasonably likely to be accessed by children” and “best interests of children” standards are vague.[[47]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn47) A ruling is expected in the coming weeks.\\n\\n> > > **d.

New York’s Amended Labor Law**\\n\\nOn September 14, 2023, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation amending the New York State Labor Law to restrict employers from accessing their employees’ and job applicants’ “Personal Accounts.”[[64]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn64) This law is currently in effect.[[65]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn65) Personal Account under the law covers several popular social media applications, defined as “an account or profile on an electronic medium where users may create, share, and view user-generated content . . . exclusively for personal purposes.”[[66]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn66) The law applies to all employers operating in the state of New York, excluding law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and departments of corrections and community supervision.[[67]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn67)\\n\\nThe law prohibits employers from requesting, requiring, or coercing their employees or job applicants to provide a password, username, or other information to access a Personal Account, to access their Personal Accounts in their employer’s presence, or to reproduce information from their Personal Accounts.[[68]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn68) Employers are prohibited from retaliating against any employee or job applicant that refuses to provide such information.[[69]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn69)\\n\\nThe law still enables employers to retrieve employee or job applicant information for the purpose of investigating or reporting alleged misconduct, provided the information is in the public domain or voluntarily shared.[[70]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn70) The law also enables employers to require employees to disclose access information to a Personal Account on the employer’s internal information systems,[[71]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn71) or to an account used for business purposes.[[72]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn72)\\n\\n> > > **h. California’s Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act**\\n\\nOn September 20, 2024, California [enacted](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/20/governor-newsom-signs-landmark-bill-to-protect-kids-from-social-media-addiction-takes-action-on-other-measures/) its Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act. The law prohibits operators of “addictive” internet-based services or applications from providing “addictive feeds” to minors, unless the operator does not have actual knowledge that the user is a minor or obtains verifiable parental consent to provide such feeds to the minor user.[[73]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn73) The law also prohibits these operators from sending notifications to minor users between certain hours.[[74]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn74) Operators are also required to annually disclose the number of minor users of its service or application.[[75]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn75)\\n\\nThis law was blocked from enforcement earlier this year, with the trial court concluding that the law was likely an unconstitutional restriction on protected speech. As of January 28, 2025, the Ninth Circuit has granted a permanent injunction against the law’s enforcement, pending the defendants’ appeal.[[76]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn76)\\n\\n> > > **i. Colorado and California’s Amendments to the “Sensitive Data” Definition**\\n\\nOn April 17, 2024, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed a bill to expand the definition of “sensitive data” under the CPA to include “biological data” and “neural data,” which went into effect on [August 7, 2024](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1058). Similarly, on September 28, 2024, California [passed a bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1223) to amend the definition of “sensitive personal information” in the California Consumer Privacy Act to include “neural data,” which went into effect immediately.\\n\\nBoth laws define “neural data” to include information generated by measuring the activity of a consumer’s central or peripheral nervous system.[[77]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn77) Colorado requires that “neural data” “be processed by or with the assistance of a device,”[[78]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn78) whereas California provides that “neural data” “is not inferred from nonneural information.”[[79]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn79) Both laws would apply to novel neurotechnology devices and more commonplace items like electroencephalograms (EEGs).[[80]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn80) Colorado has gone one step further by including “biological data” in its definition of “sensitive information,” which it defines as “data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of an individual’s biological, genetic, biochemical, physiological, or neural properties, compositions, or activities or of an individual’s body or bodily functions, which data is used or intended to be used, singly or in combination with other personal data, for identification purposes.”[[81]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn81)\\n\\n> > **3. Federal Legislation**\\n\\n> > > **a. Comprehensive Federal Privacy Legislation**\\n\\nCalls for comprehensive federal privacy legislation remain loud and unanswered, despite bipartisan congressional efforts to introduce new legislation.\\n\\nThe comprehensive American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) was introduced on April 7, 2024, by a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers, and attempts to create a unified data privacy standard addressing the collection and processing of personal data as well as data breaches.[[82]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn82) As proposed, APRA would grant consumers the right to access, correct, delete, and export collected data and to know who their data is transferred to and the purpose for transfer.[[83]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn83)[The Congressional Research Service notes](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB11161) that APRA would also preempt state privacy laws, subject to certain exceptions.\\n\\nSince its introduction APRA has seen little movement, due to strong opposition from a variety of stakeholders and prioritization of other legislation. State regulators, [such as the California Privacy Protection Agency](https://cppa.ca.gov/pdf/cppa_letter_opposing_apra.pdf), oppose APRA as it would preempt state laws in the same area. [Certain interest groups](https://iapp.org/news/a/stakeholders-consider-impacts-of-latest-apra-draft-text) opposed the removal of provisions relating to civil rights protections and algorithmic accountability. [A last-minute cancellation](https://iapp.org/news/a/american-privacy-rights-act-markup-canceled-next-us-house-steps-uncertain) of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s scheduled markup of the APRA on June 27, 2024 was the last official action taken on the bill.\\n\\nWhile momentum for APRA has slowed, former FTC Chair Jon Leibowitz [stated](https://therecord.media/data-privacy-experts-predict-some-wins-trump)“[t]here’s 85% agreement between Democrats and Republicans about what should be in it, so I expect real movement on privacy legislation, even if what goes through lacks a private right of action, for example.” However, given the many other competing objectives of the new Trump Administration in the early days of the Administration, it is unlikely that a bill will be passed in the coming months.\\n\\n> > > **b. Other Introduced Legislation**\\n\\nCongress passed only one privacy-related law in 2024, which focused on national security issues, although [a number of consumer and individual privacy-related](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf)[laws](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf)[w](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf)[ere](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf)[introduced](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf). In April 2024, President Biden signed H.R. 815 into law, which included the Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024.[[84]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn84) PADFAA represents an effort to regulate the transfer of personal data from the U.S. due to national security concerns. The law, which went into effect on June 23, 2024, prohibits data brokers from selling, transferring, or disclosing personally identifiable sensitive data of a U.S. individual to any foreign adversary country (China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea) or any entity controlled by a foreign adversary country.[[85]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn85) PADFAA defines “personally identifiable sensitive data” broadly as “any sensitive data that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable, alone or in combination with other data, to an individual or a device that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to an individual.”[[86]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn86)\\n\\nOther proposed privacy legislation covered a range of topics—including workplace privacy, health privacy, financial privacy, privacy for children online, facial recognition, and AI—several of which attracted significant bipartisan support, but lawmakers remained divided over the same two issues that sunk more comprehensive federal privacy legislation: (1) whether federal privacy laws should preempt state laws (a position attracting more Republican support); and (2) whether it should include a private right of action (which more Democrats favor).\\n\\nOf the proposed privacy-focused legislation in 2024, much of the focus was on digital privacy and safety, especially for children on social media. Congress held [widely publicized hearings](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/releases/recap-senate-judiciary-committee-presses-big-tech-ceos-on-failures-to-protect-kids-online-during-landmark-hearing) on the topic, questioning social media executives on their failure to protect children online. In July 2024, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly [passed a pair of measures](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/index.php/2024/7/senate-overwhelmingly-passes-children-s-online-privacy-legislation) seeking to put more responsibility on social media platforms to ensure child safety online: The Kids Online Safety Act, which establishes a duty of care for online platforms and requires them to activate the most protective settings for kids by default, and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), which amends COPPA. COPPA 2.0 extends existing COPPA protections by banning online companies from collecting personal information from teenage users over the age of 12 and under 17, and broadening the entities and services covered. It also makes it unlawful to collect and use personal information from children and teens in targeted advertisements while affording users a right to erasure of their content and imposes new obligations for businesses that collect personal information from children and teens. The full House of Representatives has yet to debate either bill and it is unclear if action will be taken in 2025 to move either forward.\\n\\nOther privacy bills introduced in 2024 include: The Verifying Kids’ Online Privacy Act (amending COPPA to define a child as an individual under the age of 16 rather than 13 and requiring operators to verify the age of individuals accessing their service), the Stop Spying Bosses Act (requiring disclosure of or prohibiting surveillance, monitoring, and collection of worker data),[[87]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn87) the No Robot Bosses Act (prohibiting employers from relying exclusively on automated decisionmaking systems to make decisions regarding employment),[[88]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn88) the Reproductive Data Privacy and Protection Act (ensuring government entities that seek to compel disclosures relating to reproductive or sexual health information cannot do so for investigatory purposes),[[89]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn89) the American Donor Privacy and Foreign Funding Transparency Act (restricting the ability of federal government entities to collect or require submission of information on the identification of donors to tax-exempt organizations),[[90]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn90) the Protecting Privacy in Purchases Act (prohibiting payment card networks from requiring firearms retailers to use a merchant category code that would distinguish it from a general merchandise or sporting goods retailer),[[91]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn91) and others described in this Review.\\n\\nCongress also considered cybersecurity-related legislation: The Healthcare Cybersecurity Act of 2024 (requiring the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services to work together and implement a variety of measures to improve cyber defenses in the healthcare sector),[[92]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn92) the Farm and Food Cybersecurity Act of 2024 (requiring studies and simulation exercise for food-related cyber emergencies, threats, and disruptions),[[93]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn93) and the Health Infrastructure Security and Accountability Act (creating mandatory minimum cybersecurity standards for health care providers, health plans, clearinghouses, and business associates along with requiring independent audits).[[94]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn94)\\n\\n> **B. Enforcement and Guidance**\\n\\nIn 2024, federal regulators continued to actively pursue enforcement action and rulemaking related to cybersecurity and data privacy. This section summarizes the noteworthy efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and other federal and state agencies. The priorities reflected in federal enforcement actions and rulemakings will likely shift in 2025, as the newly appointed agency leaders implement the Trump Administration’s policy agenda.\\n\\n> > **1. Federal Trade Commission**\\n\\nThe FTC continued its active regulation and enforcement of cybersecurity and data privacy in 2024. A number of the FTC’s litigation matters, many of which represented its focus on sensitive consumer data such as geolocation and health information, reached settlement. The impact of the agency’s rulemaking can also be seen in its recent settlement agreements. For example, aspects of its [Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/13/2023-24412/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information) (Safeguards Rule) were often cited in settlements of data privacy enforcement matters through terms, such as limiting an entities’ agents’ access to consumer information only where necessary.\\n\\nThe[FTC also launched](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-issues-orders-eight-companies-seeking-information-surveillance-pricing), via orders pursuant to Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, fact-finding studies into eight companies to investigate how the companies use consumers’ personal data to engage in personalized pricing—the practice of charging different customers different prices for the same good. In his [concurring statement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/surveillance-pricing-6b-ferguson-concurrence.pdf), Former Commissioner, and current Chair, Andrew Ferguson emphasized the primary goal of these studies as fact-finding rather than pursuing enforcement action or rulemaking. He suggested that any necessary remedial action should be left to Congress and state lawmakers.\\n\\nOther areas that the FTC prioritized included algorithmic bias and AI, commercial surveillance, data security, and children’s privacy. Further, the FTC expanded its regulatory and enforcement scope related to biometric information.\\n\\nThis section discusses the FTC’s notable actions in 2024; however, it bears noting that the agency’s outlook this year will be impacted by President Trump’s February 18, 2025 [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/) requiring independent agencies to consult with the White House about its strategic plans, priorities, and draft regulations. While the executive order expressly lists the FTC, SEC, and FCC as impacted agencies, the CFPB probably will be impacted as well [if it is operational](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/cfpb-remaining-trump-administration-says-00205913) under the Trump administration.\\n\\n> > > **a. FTC Organization Updates**\\n\\nOn March 25, 2024, Republican [Melissa Holyoak](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/melissa-holyoak) was sworn in as a Commissioner for the FTC, filling the seat left open by former Commissioner [Christine Wilson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/christine-s-wilson) in March 2023. Subsequently, on April 2, 2024, Republican [Andrew Ferguson](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/andrew-n-ferguson) was sworn in as a Commissioner, filling the seat left open by former Commissioner [Noah Phillips](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/noah-joshua-phillips) in October 2022.\\n\\nIn December 2024, President Donald Trump [announced](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-picks-andrew-ferguson-chair-ftc-2024-12-10/) he planned to appoint Commissioner Ferguson to replace then-Chair Lina Khan. During the same month, reports circulated with a [leaked document](https://punchbowl.news/wp-content/uploads/FTC-Commissioner-Andrew-N-Ferguson-Overview.pdf) that professed to lay out Ferguson’s priorities for the agency, if he were selected as the Chair. Specifically, it stated Ferguson’s “Agenda for the FTC” would: “Reverse Lina Khan’s Anti-Business Agenda,” with “no more novel and legally dubious consumer protection cases,” and by “stop[ping] abus[e of] FTC enforcement authorities as a substitute for comprehensive privacy legislation”; “Hold Big Tech Accountable and Stop Censorship,”[[95]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn95) including through focused antitrust enforcement; “Protect Freedom of Speech and Fight Wokeness,” including by “end[ing] the FTC’s attacks on online anonymity”; and “Fight the Bureaucracy to Implement Trump’s Agenda.” On January 20, 2025, President Trump [appointed](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/andrew-n-ferguson-takes-over-ftc-chairman) Andrew Ferguson as the new FTC Chairman.\\n\\nIn December 2024, President Trump also [announced](https://iapp.org/news/a/trump-taps-andrew-ferguson-to-chair-ftc-nominates-mark-meador-commissioner) he planned to nominate Mark Meador as the new Republican FTC commissioner to replace the seat left open by prior Chair Lina Khan, whose term expired on January 31, 2025. Meador is currently a partner at law firm Kressin Meador Powers and previously worked for the FTC and the DOJ and as Deputy Chief Counsel for Antitrust & Competition to Republican Senator Mike Lee. Meador has [vocally supported](https://www.mlex.com/mlex/articles/2273636/us-ftc-nominee-meador-signals-continued-headaches-for-big-tech-consolidation) efforts to regulate big technology companies and has called for increased antitrust enforcement.\\n\\nIf Meador is confirmed, the FTC will be led by a Republican majority for the first time since Commissioner Bedoya was confirmed in 2022.\\n\\n> > > **b. Algorithmic Bias and Artificial Intelligence**\\n\\nAlgorithmic bias has been a growing concern regarding the use of AI technology for the FTC under former FTC chair, Lina Khan. In 2023, Khan, in a [guest editorial for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/opinion/ai-lina-khan-ftc-technology.html), expressed concern over AI tools being fed information “riddled with errors and bias,” thereby “automating discrimination” and unfairly inhibiting people’s access to financial services, employment, and housing, among others.\\n\\nIn December 2023, the FTC [filed a complaint and proposed stipulated order](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/rite-aid-banned-using-ai-facial-recognition-after-ftc-says-retailer-deployed-technology-without) against a convenience store chain. The FTC alleged the chain used AI-based facial recognition technology (FRT) to identify customers who may have been engaging in shoplifting and other problematic behavior. In March 2024, the [court entered the stipulated order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/DE019-StipulatedOrderforPermanentInjunctionandOtherRelief.pdf), which prohibits the company from using FRT for five years. In December of 2024, the FTC once again filed a complaint and proposed stipulated order, this time against an AI and Deep Learning-based video analytics and video cloud software company, alleging that the company made false, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims that its AI-powered facial recognition software was free of gender or racial bias, and that it had one of the highest accuracy rates on the market despite lacking the evidence to support such claims. The [complaint also alleged](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Complaint-IntellivisionTechCorp.pdf) that the company did not train its FRT software on “millions of faces” as it advertised, but only on approximately 100 unique individuals. The [FTC’s finalized order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2323023c4809intellivisionfinalorder.pdf) against the company prohibits the company from misrepresenting the accuracy and efficacy of its technology without competent and reliable testing of the technology to support its claims, among other restrictions and requirements.\\n\\nNewly appointed Chair Ferguson has [expressed his disagreement](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-trumps-new-ftc-chair-views-ai-big-tech-2024-12-12/) with the FTC’s prior approach to AI, indicating his belief that the “pro-regulation side of the AI debate” is “the wrong one.” For example, Chair Ferguson has [expressed some disagreement](https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2024-12-20_KAMVIV0839K1H435%2Fferguson-statement-social-media-6b.pdf) with the FTC’s approach to defining bias. In his [statement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/intellivision-ferguson-concurrence.pdf) concurring in the FTC’s action against the AI and Deep Learning-based video analytics and video cloud software company, IntelliVision, he expressed discomfort with relying on “statistical disparity in false-positive and false-negative rates” to define or determine the presence of bias and instead focused on IntelliVision’s failure to substantiate its claims that its software had “zero gender or racial bias.”\\n\\n> > > **c. Commercial Surveillance and Data Security**\\n\\nIn 2023, as discussed in our [prior alerts](https://www.gibsondunn.com/ftc-launches-commercial-surveillance-and-data-security-rulemaking-holds-a-public-forum-and-seeks-public-input/), the FTC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on commercial surveillance and data security. In July 2024, the FTC [issued orders](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-issues-orders-eight-companies-seeking-information-surveillance-pricing) to “eight companies offering surveillance pricing products and services . . . seek[ing] information about the potential impact these practices have on privacy, competition, and consumer protection.” In January 2025, the FTC then [released its initial findings](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-surveillance-pricing-study-indicates-wide-range-personal-data-used-set-individualized-consumer) in a surveillance pricing market study, which provided insights into the level of detail at which consumer behavior and demographics are surveilled and analyzed and the effects this has on surveillance pricing. That same day, the FTC announced it would open up [public comments](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/sp6b-rfi.pdf) on its commercial surveillance probe, which, unrelated to any proposed rulemaking, asked for public input until April 17, 2025 from businesses and workers about their experiences or views on the impact of surveillance pricing. On January 22, 2025, Chair Ferguson [closed public comments](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/khan-statement-regarding-request-for-public-comment-re-surveillance-pricing-practices.pdf). The unexplained shutdown of public comments has been [criticized](https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2025-01-23_11FQTX4770120M76%2Fbedoya-statement-emergency-motion.pdf) by fellow FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya.\\n\\nWhile Chair Ferguson has [voiced support](https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2024-12-20_KAMVIV0839K1H435%2Fferguson-statement-social-media-6b.pdf) for the FTC’s attempts to inform consumers regarding the extent of commercial surveillance, he has criticized the FTC’s approach to targeted advertising and AI arguing both that such targeted advertising is beneficial to consumers, and that mass data collection is difficult to avoid but also critical for the operation of many free internet services. The FTC may take a different approach to commercial surveillance concerns going forward. Both Chair Ferguson and Commissioner Melissa Holyoak [dissented](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/surveillance-pricing-6b-research-summaries-ferguson-dissent-final.pdf) from the former Democratic majority in the FTC for what the Republican Commissioners perceived as rushing to publish the initial findings of the surveillance pricing study. Chair Ferguson and Commissioner Holyoak opined that it was irresponsible for the FTC to put forward such a preliminary “beta” version of their findings, just to publicize an FTC statement on the matter prior to the start of President Trump’s term.\\n\\n> > > **d. Notable FTC Enforcement Actions**\\n\\nIn 2024, the FTC continued to aggressively enforce data privacy and the uses of sensitive consumer information. There are a few trends that businesses can observe as part and parcel of the agency’s agenda last year—in case resolutions, the FTC required the entities collecting and using location and health information for non-essential functions to delete that data, and invest in significant privacy and data security programs. Irrespective of an administration change, the FTC likely will continue to focus on the failure to protect or the misuse of sensitive data—actions that Commissioner Holyoak has supported in multiple concurring statements she published supporting related FTC [actions](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/comm-holyoak-statement-re-verkada.pdf) and [settlements](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2024-7-15-Commissioner-Holyoak-Statement-re-Kochava-final.pdf).\\n\\n**_Corporate Landlord of Single-Family Homes_**. The FTC and a corporate landlord reached a settlement to resolve the [FTC’s allegations](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1-Complaint_0.pdf) of undisclosed “junk fees,” improper retention of tenants’ security deposits and refunds, and misrepresentation of home inspection and maintenance practices. The company [agreed to pay](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-takes-action-against-invitation-homes-deceiving-renters-charging-junk-fees-withholding-security) a $45 million fee that the FTC says will be used to refund impacted consumers. The company is also [permanently restrained](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023170invitationhomesorderenteredbycourt.pdf) from mispresenting monthly lease pricing and fees, property conditions, and the circumstances under which it will deduct funds from consumers’ security deposits. Consistent with the agency’s recent focus on consumer data retention, the settlement requires the corporate landlord to delete all financial data collected from consumers outside limited circumstances.\\n\\n**_Digital Marketing and Data Aggregator_**. After facing allegations of impermissibly collecting and using consumers’ location data for advertising purposes, a marketing company [reached a settlement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-finalizes-order-inmarket-prohibiting-it-selling-or-sharing-precise-location-data) with the FTC. The [administrative complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/InMarketMedia-Complaint.pdf) alleged the company failed to fully disclose to consumers how their location data, which would reveal where they live and work, would be used for purposes other than necessary app functions. The [agreed-upon order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/InMarketMedia-DecisionandOrder.pdf) prohibits the company from sharing in any way consumers’ precise location data, or offering any product or service designed to target consumers based on their location. The FTC [also required](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-will-ban-inmarket-selling-precise-consumer-location-data) the company to destroy all stored location data or ensure the data is deidentified.\\n\\n**_Substance Abuse Telehealth Firms_**. The DOJ settled an action it brought on behalf of the FTC against two telehealth companies for alleged violation of the Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act of 2018 (OARFPA) through unfair and deceptive trade practices relating to [alcohol](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/MonumentEnteredFinalOrder.pdf) and [substance abuse treatment](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cerebral_joint_stipulation_order_permanent_injunction.pdf). In addition to the monetary penalties, the court-approved joint stipulations banning the companies from disclosing consumer health information to third parties for advertising purposes. The companies must also implement a privacy and data security program to formalize the process by which they keep health information secure, as well as a data retention schedule to limit the time period that they retain consumer data.\\n\\n**_Online Therapy_**. In May 2024, an online therapy firm [began issuing refund notifications](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/betterhelp-customers-will-begin-receiving-notices-about-refunds-related-2023-privacy-settlement-ftc) to impacted consumers, based on a [2023 settlement with the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/202_3169-betterhelp-consent.pdf) arising out of allegations that the firm shared consumers’ sensitive data with third parties. The FTC [has indicated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-ban-betterhelp-revealing-consumers-data-including-sensitive-mental-health-information-facebook) that it considers sensitive consumer data to include email addresses, IP addresses, and answers to personal health questions. The online therapy provider was [charged](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2023169-betterhelp-complaint_.pdf) with sharing such consumer information with online and app advertisers without setting appropriate limitations for the advertisers’ use of the data, and without obtaining consumer consent.\\n\\n**_Software Provider_**. The FTC [settled allegations](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/06/ftc-finalizes-order-avast-banning-it-selling-or-licensing-web-browsing-data-advertising-requiring-it) against a UK-based software provider that its Czech subsidiary collected and sold consumer browsing information without adequate notice and consent. The subsidiary [is alleged](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-order-will-ban-avast-selling-browsing-data-advertising-purposes-require-it-pay-165-million-over) to have sold the browsing data to more than 100 third parties. As per the [final order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/202_3033_-_avast_final_consent_package.pdf), the company and its subsidiaries are required to delete the copies of the data that was sold, and to obtain consent from future consumers before selling browsing data for advertising purposes.\\n\\n**_Data Brokers_**. The FTC brought a [second amended complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/86-SecondAmendedComplaint.pdf) against a data broker for allegedly violating Section 5 of the FTC Act by selling consumers’ precise location data. The second amended complaint comes after the presiding federal district court judge [denied the data broker’s attempt to dismiss the suit](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/71-OpiniononMTD.pdf). In her [concurring statement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2024-7-15-Commissioner-Holyoak-Statement-re-Kochava-final.pdf) in support of the Commission’s vote to file the amended pleading, Commissioner Holyoak underscored the importance of “vigorously pursuing” the action in order to protect precise geolocation information identifying consumers’ visits to sensitive locations. A separate data broker also [agreed to settle](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-finalizes-order-prohibiting-gravy-analytics-venntel-selling-sensitive-location-data) FTC claims that it unlawfully tracked and sold sensitive location data. The Commission voted 5-0 to approve the [final order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/212_3035_-_gravy_analytics_final_consent_package_without_signatures.pdf), which prohibits the data broker from selling sensitive location data or collecting such data, outside a limited number of approved purposes.\\n\\n**_Security Camera Company_**. The DOJ [settled an action](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2123068verkadasignedorder.pdf) it brought on behalf of the FTC against a security camera company that is alleged to have violated the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). The company is also [alleged](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/ftc-takes-action-against-security-camera-firm-verkada-over-charges-it-failed-secure-videos-other) to have had insufficient security measures over consumer data it collected, allowing a hacker to access customers’ security camera data in 2021. The hacker is [alleged](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2123068verkadacomplaint.pdf) to have accessed cameras in particularly sensitive locations such as psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. The company [agreed](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2123068verkadasignedorder.pdf) to pay a $2.95 million monetary penalty for its CAN-SPAM violation and implement an information privacy program, among other actions.\\n\\n**_Smart Home Technology_**. In December, the FTC [sent the first set of payments](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-sends-payments-consumers-harmed-vivints-misuse-consumer-credit-reports) to consumers allegedly harmed by a home security company’s misuse of credit reports. The company, which agreed to a settlement with the FTC in 2021, [paid $5 million](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/04/smart-home-monitoring-company-vivint-will-pay-20-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-misused-consumer) to be disbursed directly to consumers. According to the FTC, the company’s sales representatives relied on false or unverified information to help consumers get financing approval for products and services that they would not otherwise be qualified to receive. The FTC’s December payment of nearly $500,000 is directed to 470 consumers, who filed a valid claim. Additional funds are stated to be distributed at a later date.\\n\\n> > > **e. Financial Privacy**\\n\\n[Pursuant to Section 6(b) of the FTC Act](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/resolution_surveillance_pricing.pdf), the [FTC issued orders](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/sp6b_order_surv_pricing.pdf) to eight firms, including financial services firms, that advertise using customer information and machine learning technologies to engage in targeted pricing to consumers. The [orders require](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/sp6b_order_surv_pricing.pdf) recipient companies to disclose documents showing how they use consumer data, such as credit history, to engage in “surveillance pricing,” also known as “personalized pricing.” This pricing practice involves charging different prices for the same product based on the consumer’s personal data. The firms were [mandated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-issues-orders-eight-companies-seeking-information-surveillance-pricing) to provide documents and information relating to four specific aspects of their personalized pricing:\\n\\n*   The types of products and services offered using personalized pricing;\\n*   The personalized pricing offerings’ underlying data and how such data was collected;\\n*   Targeted clients and their use of the offerings; and\\n*   Resulting pricing differentials for the same offering and other impacts.\\n\\nIn a [concurring statement](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/surveillance-pricing-6b-ferguson-concurrence.pdf), then-Commissioner Ferguson underscored the primary goal of these studies as gathering information rather than pursuing enforcement actions, expressing the importance of revealing to Congress and the public “whether and how consumers’ private data may be used to affect their pocketbooks.” He voiced less enthusiasm for the Commission taking remedial action based on the studies’ outcome, suggesting instead that state and federal legislators may address any needed response through privacy laws.\\n\\nIn addition to launching the personalized pricing study, the FTC began to incorporate aspects of its [Safeguards Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/13/2023-24412/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information) in case resolutions. Settlement agreements of actions involving unsecured consumer information, in particular, reflect certain components of the Safeguards Rule. For example, a common settlement term requires companies to [implement information privacy programs](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/MonumentEnteredFinalOrder.pdf) and [abstain from misleading consumers](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/202_3033_-_avast_final_consent_package.pdf) about the strength and integrity of their consumer privacy measures. One [important feature of these programs](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cerebral_joint_stipulation_order_permanent_injunction.pdf) is that the entity must place limitations on an employee’s, contractor’s, and authorized third parties’ access to consumer information based on job necessity.\\n\\n> > > **f. Children’s and Teens’ Privacy**\\n\\nAt the end of 2023, the FTC [proposed amendments to COPPA](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/12/ftc-proposes-strengthening-childrens-privacy-rule-further-limit-companies-ability-monetize-childrens), aiming to shift the burden for protecting children’s privacy and security from parents to service providers. As of January 16, 2025, the FTC [finalized changes](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-finalizes-changes-childrens-privacy-rule-limiting-companies-ability-monetize-kids-data/) to COPPA. The final rule’s amendments include:\\n\\n*   Opt-in parental consent requirements for covered operators to disclose children’s personal information to third-party companies for targeted advertising or other purposes;\\n*   Limits on data retention where covered operators may only retain personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill a specific purpose for which it was collected;\\n*   Public disclosure requirements for COPPA’s self-regulatory Self-Harbor programs, such as disclosure of information on their membership lists; and\\n*   Several amended definitions, including the expansion of “personal information” to include biometric identifiers and government-issued identifiers.\\n\\nIn adopting the final rule, the FTC decided against adopting some proposed changes it received during the public comment period, such as a requirement to limit the use of push notifications directed to children without parental consent and changes to requirements applicable to educational technology companies that operate in a school environment.\\n\\nIn 2023, the [FTC also sought comment](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-seeks-comment-new-parental-consent-mechanism-under-coppa) on the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s (ESRB) application for a “Privacy-Protective Facial Age Estimation” technology that analyzes a user’s face to confirm their age, which would serve as a consent mechanism under COPPA’s requirement that parents consent to an online service collecting their children’s personal data. On March 29, 2024, the [FTC denied the ESRB’s application](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/03/ftc-denies-application-new-parental-consent-mechanism-under-coppa) with a vote of 4-0 due to insufficient information. The FTC made this denial without prejudice to enable the ESRB to re-file the application in the future, when the FTC anticipates that additional information will assist in the understanding of age verification technologies. The FTC otherwise took no position on the merits of the application.\\n\\nIn 2024, the FTC [continued to pursue enforcement](https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1854366/congress-urges-doj-to-probe-tiktok-kids-privacy-concerns) actions against major technology companies in relation to children’s and teens’ privacy. For example, the FTC referred a complaint to the DOJ against a technology company for possibly violating COPPA by allowing children to use its application without parental consent. The FTC also took action against an anonymous messaging application marketed to kids and teens for allegedly violating COPPA by failing to ensure that a parent receives direct notice of and consents to its practices around collecting, using, or disclosing their child’s personal information.[[96]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn96) Although not an enforcement action, the [FTC additionally](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance)examined the data collection and use practices of nine big technology companies, which eventually led to a report upon which the FTC based recommendations to policymakers and companies.\\n\\n> > > **g. Biometric Information**\\n\\nIn May 2023, the FTC published its [Policy Statement on Biometric Information](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p225402biometricpolicystatement.pdf). See the Biometric Information section of our [2024 annual update](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-outlook-and-review-2024/) for additional details on the policy statement.\\n\\nThe policy statement specified that making unsubstantiated marketing claims regarding the validity, reliability, accuracy, performance, fairness, or efficacy of technologies relying on biometric information constitute deceptive practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act. In December 2024, the [FTC announced a proposed consent order](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-takes-action-against-intellivision-technologies-deceptive-claims-about-its-facial-recognition) with an AI and Deep Learning-based video analytics and video cloud software company to settle the FTC’s allegations that the company could not substantiate its marketing claims on the accuracy of its facial recognition technologies, including its accuracy across genders, ethnicities and skin tones. The [proposed order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/D%26O-IntellivisionTechCorp.pdf) prohibits the company from making misrepresentations regarding the efficacy and lack of bias in its facial recognition technologies.\\n\\n> > **2. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**\\n\\nOver the past year, the CFPB finalized and proposed multiple rulemakings which implicate privacy issues, with a flurry of such action in the waning days of the Biden Administration. As of this report’s publication, [the Trump Administration has paused](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/bessent-pauses-cfpb-litigation-new-rules-as-he-takes-the-reins) implementation of several of these rulemakings, and the agency’s future is currently [uncertain](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/musks-doge-descends-on-consumer-financial-protection-bureau).\\n\\n> > > **a. A Dramatic Shift Under the Trump Administration**\\n\\nFollowing significant actions by the CFPB in 2024—including related to data privacy, data security, and algorithmic decisionmaking—thus far in 2025, the interim CFPB Directors appointed by President Trump have imposed significant operational changes that raise significant questions about the agency’s future scope and direction.\\n\\nAfter removing Rohit Chopra as CFPB Director on January 31, 2025, President Trump appointed in quick succession Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and then Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as Acting CFPB Directors. Bessent and then Vought moved rapidly to freeze virtually all CFPB activities, [ordering employees to stop all enforcement and litigation activity](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/bessent-consumer-bureau-chief-00202076); [halting rulemakings and suspending effective dates of pending rules](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/bessent-pauses-cfpb-litigation-new-rules-as-he-takes-the-reins); [closing the CFPB’s Washington, DC office for a week](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/vought-moves-to-defang-cfpb-telling-staff-to-halt-all-supervision-19f1ac9f) and [cancelling the headquarter’s lease](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-admin-denies-plans-shutter-cfpb-court-papers-say-2025-02-25/); canceling [the CFPB’s next pull of funding from the Federal Reserve](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/09/vought-cuts-off-cfpb-funding-00203261); [cancelling over $100 million in vendor contracts](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/cfpb-nixes-all-expert-witness-contracts-in-enforcement-shutdown); [firing probationary-period staff](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/12/nx-s1-5294479/cfpb-workers-fired-trump-doge); and [dismissing (without explanation) various enforcement actions filed during the Biden Administration](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/cfpb-drops-capital-one-rocket-mortgage-affiliate-lawsuits.html). While President Trump and the head of DOGE, Elon Musk, have expressed a desire to eliminate the CFPB, the Trump Administration has recently taken the position in [court](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/cfpb-remaining-trump-administration-says-00205913) that it only intends to make the agency more “streamlined and efficient.”\\n\\nConsistent with this position, Jonathan McKernan, President Trump’s nominee for CFPB Director, testified in early March before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, that he would continue to enforce consumer protection laws while advocating for reforms to increase accountability and end the CFPB’s “past excesses.” At the time of publication, McKernan’s nomination is pending confirmation.\\n\\n> > > **b. Impact of the Trump Administration’s Actions on the Pre-Trump CFPB’s Ambitious Agenda**\\n\\nPrecisely how CFPB under Trump-appointed leadership will reshape the agency’s approach to consumer protection remains to be seen.\\n\\nThe outgoing CFPB pursued an ambitious and aggressive rulemaking, policy, and enforcement agenda, often in reliance on novel and expansive interpretations of its statutory authority. In the near term, regulated parties can expect new CFPB leadership to critically examine these initiatives—likely rescinding some rules and guidance, and continuing to drop certain enforcement actions while continuing to pursue others.\\n\\nFor example, there is substantial uncertainty around the agency’s key 2024 rulemakings and guidance related to data privacy, data security, and AI. Specifically, on December 3, 2024, the CFPB [proposed a sweeping new rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-stop-data-brokers-from-selling-sensitive-personal-data-to-scammers-stalkers-and-spies/) that would subject data brokers to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with the goal of limiting the sharing of consumer financial data. On March 5, 2025, the comment period for this rule was extended from March 3, 2025, until April 2, 2025, with the Bureau stating it was doing so in order to give interested persons additional time to consider and submit comments. What new leadership will do with respect to this rule remains to be seen, although it seems unlikely they will embrace it in its proposed form.\\n\\nAdditionally, the effective date of the agency’s [final rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/required-rulemaking-on-personal-financial-data-rights) issued in October 2024 under Section 1033 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) requiring certain financial institutions to make data such as account and transaction information available upon request to consumers and authorized third parties has [been suspended](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5285356/treasury-secretary-bessent-acting-cfpb-director). The ordered suspension sweeps in all other CFPB final rules that had not gone into effect as of February 3, 2025, like the[final rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/cfpb-approves-rule-to-ensure-accuracy-and-accountability-in-the-use-of-ai-and-algorithms-in-home-appraisals/)[issued](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/cfpb-approves-rule-to-ensure-accuracy-and-accountability-in-the-use-of-ai-and-algorithms-in-home-appraisals/) in June 2024 aiming to mitigate AI-driven bias in housing appraisals that was slated to go into effect in approximately June 2025. However, a significant [final rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/defining-larger-participants-of-a-market-for-general-use-digital-consumer-payment-applications/) issued in November 2024 establishing the agency’s supervisory power over nonbank digital payment providers took effect before then-Acting Director Bessent’s February 3, 2025 instruction [freezing final rules](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/bessent-pauses-cfpb-litigation-new-rules-as-he-takes-the-reins), so whether action will be taken to rescind the rule remains to be seen.\\n\\nThe CFPB’s prior leadership had also intensified scrutiny of AI in financial services, issuing [guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-to-curb-unchecked-worker-surveillance/) and a [special edition of its Supervisory Highlights](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/supervisory-highlights-advanced-technologies-special-edition-issue-38-winter-2025/) emphasizing compliance obligations, which new CFPB leadership may also rescind.\\n\\nIn the longer term, the CFPB’s future is uncertain. Courts might step in to limit an administrative shutdown of the agency. The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which represents unionized CFPB employees, brought an action in federal court challenging Vought’s stop-work directive, arguing that separation-of-powers principles prevent the Trump Administration from winding down a congressionally authorized agency.[[97]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn97) The court in that matter [ordered](https://www.law360.com/consumerprotection/articles/2304705?nl_pk=8d6be06e-55a3-49ff-8496-826ccaff4057&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=consumerprotection&utm_content=2025-03-04&read_main=1&nlsidx=0&nlaidx=0) a senior CFPB official to testify on March 10, 2025 about the status of the agency’s statutorily required activities in connection with NTEU’s request for a preliminary injunction to halt mass terminations and other cuts. Additionally, the City of Baltimore and Economic Action Maryland Fund has challenged Vought’s attempt to transfer the CFPB’s funds to the Federal Reserve, arguing, among other things, that such action violated the Administrative Procedure Act because the agency would be deliberately leaving itself without enough funding to perform its legally mandated duties.[[98]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn98) A preliminary injunction preventing the funds transfer is in place until March 14, 2025.[[99]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn99)\\n\\n> > > **c. Other Regulators and Private Litigation: Filling a Potential Enforcement Gap**\\n\\nIf the CFPB’s activities continue to wane, other regulators may step up their enforcement activities. For example, the FTC, which has concurrent enforcement authority with the CFPB over certain statutes, can police “unfair practices” under the FTC Act and has insight into the CFPB’s investigations and enforcement under the agencies’ [memorandum of understandin](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_ftc_memo-of-understanding_2019-02.pdf)g. State attorneys general also have broad authority to enforce state consumer protection laws, may enforce the (federal) Consumer Financial Protection Act in their respective jurisdictions under 12 U.S.C. § 5552, and have a “[blueprint](https://www.law360.com/articles/2284260/cfpb-serves-up-consumer-protection-roadmap-for-states)” for enforcement activity in the form of a report published by the CFPB in January 2025, prior to the leadership transition. State banking departments may also enhance supervisory oversight over non-bank financial institutions in light of any perceived supervisory gap at the federal level.\\n\\nAdditionally, private litigants may seize upon regulatory uncertainty to pursue consumer litigation.\\n\\nBusinesses that have invested in compliance with recent CFPB mandates must now reassess their strategies in light of shifting federal priorities and the possibility of increased state and private litigation risk. As the regulatory pendulum swings, staying ahead of both federal and state developments will be critical for businesses seeking to navigate this rapidly evolving environment.\\n\\n> > **3. Securities and Exchange Commission**\\n\\nThe SEC continued its historic levels of enforcement activity in 2024, with a continued emphasis on disclosure and transparency requirements surrounding cybersecurity. The SEC’s new cybersecurity disclosure rule for public companies also went into effect in 2024, and numerous companies filed disclosures as required under the rule. In addition, the SEC finalized new cybersecurity disclosure rules for broker-dealers and registered investment advisers.\\n\\n> > > **a. Regulation**\\n\\n**_Companies begin disclosures of cybersecurity incidents_**. The SEC’s new cyber disclosure rule for public companies, which requires them to publicly disclose material cyber incidents, went into effect in December 2023, and 2024 was the first full year of implementation of the rule.[[100]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn100) In 2024, approximately 50 public companies filed cybersecurity [disclosures](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sec-cyber-rule-one-year/735249/) on Form 8-K. Many of these disclosures were for non-material impacts. Initially, several companies made non-material [disclosures](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001472787/000095017023072513/faf-20231220.htm) under the new cybersecurity reporting Item 1.05, which was specifically created for disclosures of material cybersecurity incidents. As a result, the Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance issued a [statement](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-05212024) suggesting that such disclosures were appropriate under Form 8-K Item 8.01, which is for miscellaneous statements, rather than Item 1.05. Due to the strict timing requirements, [some companies](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/933738/000165495424015098/eng_8k.htm) have made filings under item 1.05, stating that the company could not determine that the impact was material, only to [later amend](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933738/000165495425000798/eng_8ka.htm) their 8-K filing to state that the company had found the impact to not be material. Notably, fewer than 20% of [filings](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sec-cyber-rule-one-year/735249/) state a material impact.\\n\\nAdditionally, on June 24, 2024, the SEC issued five new compliance and disclosure [interpretations](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/compliance-disclosure-interpretations/exchange-act-form-8-k) addressing hypothetical scenarios involving the public company disclosure requirement. Four of these interpretations concern ransomware payment, and provide guidance on how to conduct materiality assessments in scenarios where the company makes such a payment, while the fifth addresses materiality determinations following a series of separate but potentially related incidents.\\n\\n**_SEC adopts data breach notification requirements for additional financial institutions_**. On August 2, 2024, a [final rule](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/34-100155.pdf) went into effect updating Regulation S–P to require registered investment advisers, transfer agents, and broker-dealers to notify customers within 30 days if their information may have been stolen. [Covered institutions](https://www.sec.gov/files/34-100155-fact-sheet.pdf) have 18 months for larger entities or 24 months for smaller entities[[101]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn101) from the date of publication in the federal register to comply with the requirements. Key requirements under the new regulation include:\\n\\n*   Covered institutions must implement an incident response program regardless of whether an incident has occurred.\\n*   Covered institutions must disclose an incident to customers as soon as practicable, and no later than 30 days after discovery of an incident. The customer notices must include details about the incident, the breached data, and how affected individuals can respond to the breach to protect themselves. This requirement is waived where an institution determines that the affected data will not be used or it is reasonably likely that it will not be used in a way that adversely affects customers.\\n*   Expands existing requirements to safeguard customer data and dispose of unused customer data to include additional types of data and apply to transfer portals in addition to previously covered institutions.\\n\\n> > > **b. Enforcement**\\n\\n**_Court dismisses much of the SEC’s complaint against Software Company_**. The SEC [originally sued](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-227.pdf) a software company in 2023 over a high-profile breach of the company’s computer system in 2020. In light of the breach, the SEC alleged that the company had made materially false statements regarding its cybersecurity practices in certain public filings and on its publicly facing website, then subsequently made misleading statements regarding a series of cybersecurity incidents that culminated in a high-profile cyber attack.\\n\\nAs we previously discussed in our July 25, 2024 [client alert](https://www.gibsondunn.com/dismissal-of-much-of-secs-solarwinds-complaint-has-potentially-broad-implications-for-sec-cybersecurity-enforcement/), the court dismissed the majority of the SEC’s claims. The remaining claims are related to the Security Statement that the company posted to their website in 2017. Most notably, the court rejected the SEC’s attempt to bring an internal accounting controls violation claim under Section 13(b)(2)(B) in the context of cybersecurity-related actions. The court reasoned that the SEC’s position that its authority to regulate an issuer’s “system of internal accounting controls” includes the authority to regulate cybersecurity controls was “not tenable,” and unsupported by the statute, legislative intent, or precedent.\\n\\nThe court’s decision also calls into question the SEC’s ability to rely on claims of inadequate disclosure controls and procedures in similar circumstances, given that the court ruled that a single disclosure failure is insufficient to put the adequacy of a company’s disclosure controls and procedures in issue.\\n\\n**_SEC fines transfer agent for alleged failure to protect client funds_**. A transfer agent was hacked in 2022 and 2023, resulting in the theft of $6.6 million in client funds. The company [recovered](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-101) about $2.6 million and fully reimbursed clients. The SEC found that the transfer agent had failed to take adequate measures to secure client funds, censured the respondent, issued a cease-and-desist order, and fined the transfer agent for $850,000.\\n\\n**_SEC fines stock exchange operator for allegedly failing to meet disclosure requirements_**. The SEC alleged that the parent company of a number of stock exchanges waited several days after learning about a cyberattack to inform compliance and legal officials at the subsidiary exchanges. The SEC took the [position](https://assets.law360news.com/1839000/1839897/34-100206.pdf) that this violated the Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg-SCI) by preventing the subsidiary exchanges from making their own timely disclosures to the SEC. The company agreed to pay $10 million to [settle](https://www.law360.com/cybersecurity-privacy/articles/1839897/nyse-parent-agrees-to-10m-sec-fine-over-cyber-breach) the charges but did not admit the allegations.\\n\\n**_SEC settles with marketing firm over alleged disclosure and internal control failures_**. The SEC [settled](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-75) with a communications and marketing company for $2.1 million over the company’s alleged violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13a-15a. The SEC alleged that the company failed to create sufficient internal cybersecurity disclosure controls, which resulted in delayed response to a 2021 ransomware attack. The SEC order notes that data security was critical to the company’s business because the company secured sensitive client data. The company settled the allegations following an investigation without admitting fault.\\n\\n> > > **c. SEC Enforcement Outlook for 2025**\\n\\nOn October 21, 2024, the SEC Division of Examinations published its annual examination priorities, which include cybersecurity as one of the Division’s planned areas of focus in 2025. However, President Trump’s nominee to chair the SEC is expected to be more pro-business than the outgoing chair, which may result in less enforcement activity overall. Moreover, Republican members of the Commission, Mark Uyeda and Hester Pierce, have expressed skepticism regarding the SEC’s previous efforts regarding cybersecurity, with both issuing dissents against recent cybersecurity enforcement actions. Commissioner Uyeda also previously issued a [statement](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-cybersecurity-072623) sharply criticizing the 2023 public-company disclosure rules. Nevertheless, the SEC recently [announced](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-42) the reformation of the crypto and cybersecurity division as the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit, with a focus on “[r]egulated entities’ compliance with cybersecurity rules and regulations,” among other priorities. Accordingly, while we expect the SEC will continue to focus on cybersecurity in 2025, there will likely be lower and less aggressive enforcement activity related to cybersecurity.\\n\\n> > **4. Department of Health and Human Services and HIPAA**\\n\\nIn October 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) [announced](https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/02-01-2025T05:49/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/10/31/hhs-office-for-civil-rights-settles-hipaa-ransomware-cybersecurity-investigation-for-90000-dollars.html) the launch of a Risk Analysis Initiative to guide health care organizations in conducting thorough evaluations of their cybersecurity practices. The initiative focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information to reduce the likelihood of cyber incidents. OCR explained that it “created the [Risk Analysis Initiative](https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/02-01-2025T05:49/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/10/31/hhs-office-for-civil-rights-settles-hipaa-ransomware-cybersecurity-investigation-for-90000-dollars.html) to increase the number of completed investigations and highlight the need for more attention and better compliance with [HIPAA’s] Security Rule,” which sets standards for protecting ePHI through administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, requiring businesses to conduct thorough risk assessments, implement and document security measures, and maintain continuous ePHI protections. The Risk Analysis Initiative signals renewed interest in enforcing HIPAA’s Security Rule, underscoring the need for covered entities to ensure they are conducting thorough and accurate ePHI-related risk assessments.\\n\\nRelatedly, on December 27, HHS issued a [notice](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/hipaa-security-rule-nprm/index.html) of proposed rulemaking aimed at improving HIPAA’s Security Rule. The proposed rule [would require](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/hipaa-security-rule-nprm/factsheet/index.html) HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates to bolster existing cybersecurity protections for protected health information, including encrypting protected health information, deploying additional technical controls to shield against malicious software, and requiring multi-factor authentication. In announcing the proposed [rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/06/2024-30983/hipaa-security-rule-to-strengthen-the-cybersecurity-of-electronic-protected-health-information), Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm [emphasized](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/hipaa-security-rule-nprm/index.html) the “increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks in the health care sector” that “pose a direct and significant threat to patient safety” and disrupt patient care. The responsibility for finalizing the rule now lies with the Trump administration, which may be more skeptical of implementing new regulations. Specifically, President Trump issued an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/) requiring a “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” directing federal agencies, including the HHS, to “not propose or issue any rule in any matter . . . until a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President . . . reviews and approves the rule.” Thus, it is unclear whether the proposed rule will proceed under the new administration.\\n\\n> > > **a. Rulemaking on HIPAA Compliance and Data Breaches**\\n\\nHHS finalized two significant HIPAA rules in 2024. On February 8, OCR finalized a [rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/fact-sheet-42-cfr-part-2-final-rule/index.html) updating the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulations to improve coordination among providers by allowing a single consent for treatment, payment, and health care operations, while also permitting de-identified disclosures to public health authorities. The [rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/16/2024-02544/confidentiality-of-substance-use-disorder-sud-patient-records) strengthens patient protections by aligning enforcement with HIPAA, introducing civil penalties for violations, requiring specific consent for substance use disorder counseling notes, and creating a safe harbor for investigative agencies acting with reasonable diligence before requesting records.\\n\\nOCR finalized another [rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/reproductive-health/final-rule-fact-sheet/index.html) on April 26, which modifies the HIPAA Privacy Rule to strengthen protections for reproductive health care by prohibiting the use or disclosure of protected health information to investigate or impose liability on individuals, health care providers, or others involved in lawful reproductive health care. The [rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/26/2024-08503/hipaa-privacy-rule-to-support-reproductive-health-care-privacy) also requires covered entities to obtain signed attestations for specific requests related to reproductive health care and mandates that these entities update their Notice of Privacy Practices to reflect these new privacy protections.\\n\\n> > > **b. Telehealth and Data Security Guidance**\\n\\nHHS released a [statement](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/telehealth-faq-2024-update-51324-clean.pdf) in May 2024, explaining that it will extend COVID-era telehealth and audio-only services beyond 2024, as was planned. As HHS explained, this change was prompted by “changes in patterns of care and higher levels of use of telehealth and audio-only services that can be expected to continue into future benefit years.” Thus, any telehealth or audio-only services between patients and qualified health professionals “that is reimbursable under applicable state law and otherwise meets applicable risk adjustment data submission standards may be submitted to issuers’ External Data Gathering Environment” servers “for purposes of HHS-operated risk adjustment program for the 2024 benefit year and beyond.” In practice, the extension of telehealth and audio-only services beyond 2024 allows insurers to include these services in their risk adjustment data, which helps determine the appropriate reimbursement they receive for covering individuals enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace and Medicaid. Through this policy pronouncement, HHS has signaled its ongoing commitment to and recognition of telehealth’s growing role in healthcare delivery.\\n\\n> > > **c. Reproductive and Sexual Health Data**\\n\\nIn addition to OCR’s final rule strengthening data protections for reproductive health care, discussed above, the FTC also took action to protect individuals’ reproductive health data. In April 2024, it finalized an [order](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-finalizes-order-x-mode-successor-outlogic-prohibiting-it-sharing-or-selling-sensitive-location) banning a data broker and its successor from sharing or selling sensitive, precise location data, which the FTC alleged could be used to track visits to “medical and reproductive health clinics and places of worship.” In addition to the ban, the order requires the data broker and its successor to develop a program to maintain a comprehensive list of sensitive locations, delete previously collected data unless deidentified or consented to by consumers, and establish privacy programs and safeguards to ensure data is not used for identifying individuals or associating with sensitive locations.\\n\\n> > > **d. HHS Enforcement Actions**\\n\\nHHS made data privacy and cybersecurity a key focus in 2024, ramping up enforcement efforts for [HIPAA](https://us.pagefreezer.com/en-US/wa/browse/0a7f82bb-be6e-448a-ae11-373d22c37842?url=https:%2F%2Fwww.hhs.gov%2Fblog%2F2025%2F01%2F07%2F2024-hipaa-accomplishments-wrap-up.html&timestamp=2025-01-22T07:02:54Z) violations, including actions involving “ransomware, phishing, health information left unsecured on the internet, impermissible access to electronic PHI, reproductive health information impermissibly disclosed, and untimely patient access to PHI.”\\n\\nOf note, the HHS reached a sizable settlement involving HIPAA Security Rule violations. In December 2024, HHS announced a [$1.19 million penalty](https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/02-01-2025T05:49/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/12/03/hhs-ocr-imposes-penalty-against-gulf-coast-pain-consultants.html) against Clearway Pain Solutions Institute for violations of the HIPAA Security Rule “following receipt of a breach report that a former contractor for the company had impermissibly accessed their electronic record system” to “retrieve PHI for use in potential fraudulent Medicare claims.” HHS concluded that the contractor had gained impermissible access on three separate occasions, compromising the PHI of over 34,000 individuals. OCR also found that Clearway Pain Solutions Institute failed to conduct a thorough risk analysis of potential vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information (ePHI) and failed to terminate former workforce members’ access to ePHI.\\n\\nReproductive health data breaches have been another priority over the last year. On November 26, 2024, HHS announced a [settlement](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/agreements/holy-redeemer-hospital-ra-cap/index.html) with Holy Redeemer Family Medicine for HIPAA Privacy Rule violations linked with disclosure of a female patient’s entire medical record to a prospective employer. The disclosure allegedly included the patient’s obstetric and gynecological history, as well as “other sensitive health information concerning reproductive health care.” The HHS [complaint](https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/02-01-2025T05:49/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/11/26/hhs-office-civil-rights-settles-holy-redeemer-hospital-disclosure-patients-protected-health-information-including-reproductive-health-information.html) stated that Holy Redeemer Family Medicine violated the HIPAA privacy rule because it lacked the adequate consent for the release of the full medical record. Under the settlement, Holy Redeemer Family Medicine agreed to pay a fine and implement a comprehensive corrective action plan requiring it to submit breach notification reports to HHS, develop policies for compliance with the Privacy Rule, and train employees on HIPAA compliance.\\n\\nLastly, HHS also ramped up enforcement under OCR’s Risk Analysis Initiative, announcing its first [enforcement action](https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/02-01-2025T05:49/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/10/31/hhs-office-for-civil-rights-settles-hipaa-ransomware-cybersecurity-investigation-for-90000-dollars.html) under the initiative in October 2024. A 2022 ransomware attack affected the PHI of 14,273 patients at Bryan County Ambulance Authority (BCAA), prompting OCR’s investigation into the entity’s alleged failure to conduct a proper risk analysis. HHS found that the entity had failed to conduct a compliant risk analysis to determine the potential risks to its ePHI systems. The parties reached a settlement requiring BCAA to pay $90,000, implement a corrective action plan to ensure HIPAA Security Rule compliance, and submit to a three-year OCR monitoring.\\n\\n> > **5. Other Federal Agencies**\\n\\n> > > **a. Department of Homeland Security**\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), together with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content, and Technology, released a joint report comparing cyber incident reporting frameworks, further expanding on its earlier efforts in standardizing reporting processes. By identifying key similarities and differences, the [report aims to inform](https://www.dhs.gov/archive/news/2023/09/19/dhs-issues-recommendations-harmonize-cyber-incident-reporting-critical) future evaluations of cyber incident reporting processes and enhance alignment between U.S. and EU cybersecurity measures, in particular through a comparative analysis of the recommendations from the U.S. Cyber Incident Reporting Council, the 2023 DHS report on [Harmonization of Cyber Incident Reporting](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/harmonization-cyber-incident-reporting-federal-government) to the Federal Government, and the [EU’s NIS2 Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) (Directive 2022/2555). [Further input](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/comparative-assessment-dhs-harmonization-cyber-incident-reporting-federal-government) has also been provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).\\n\\nThe DHS’s CISA has also published several updated guidelines, including an updated “[Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) 3.0 Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/updated-tic-30-security-capabilities-catalog-scc-v32),” providing a list of deployable security controls, security capabilities, and best practices, along with multiple updates to its “[Public Safety Communications and Cyber Resiliency Toolkit](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-updates-toolkit-seven-new-resources-promote-public-safety-communications-and-cyber-resiliency)” or the “[Marine Transportation System Resilience Assessment Guide](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/mts-resilience-assessment-guide-dec2024.pdf).” It has recently also published a revised “[National Cyber Incident Response Plan](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/revised-national-cyber-incident-response-plan-public-comment),” to which stakeholders from across public and private sectors could provide their input by January 15, 2025. Additionally, CISA has been [involved in investigations](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-peoples-republic-china-prc-targeting-commercial-telecommunications) regarding allegations that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) [targeted commercial telecommunications](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-prc-activity-targeting-telecommunications) infrastructure. CISA notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and shared information to assist potential victims. Lastly, CISA is also investigating the [recent cybersecurity incident](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-update-treasury-breach) at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\\n\\n> > > **b. Department of Justice**\\n\\n**_Final Rule on Foreign Adversaries’ Access to Sensitive Data_**. On December 27, 2024, the Department of Justice (DOJ) [issued a Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/08/2024-31486/preventing-access-to-us-sensitive-personal-data-and-government-related-data-by-countries-of-concern) aimed at restricting foreign adversaries’ access to Americans’ sensitive personal and government-related data. Previously, in February 2024, the Biden administration [already directed federal agencies](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04573/preventing-access-to-americans-bulk-sensitive-personal-data-and-united-states-government-related) to halt the transfer of sensitive American data to China, Russia, and other foreign adversaries via a corresponding executive order.\\n\\n[This Final Rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/08/2024-31486/preventing-access-to-us-sensitive-personal-data-and-government-related-data-by-countries-of-concern) now grants the DOJ authority to prohibit or impose stringent conditions on transactions involving such data when they pose a national security threat. Among other things, the rule bans transfer of three types of data to parties affiliated with the target countries: (1) bulk U.S. sensitive personal data, which includes covered personal identifiers, precise geolocation data, biometric identifiers, human genomic data, and personal financial data; (2) U.S. government-related data, which includes any data that is either precise geolocation data for certain locations, or sensitive personal data linked or linkable to certain government employees or contractors; and (3) human genomic or biospecimen data.[[102]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn102)\\n\\nAdditionally, companies handling personally identifiable information, financial data, healthcare records, and biometric data are therefore advised to review their cross-border data transfer agreements and conduct data risk assessments, ensure localization of critical datasets, and implement sufficient contractual protections when dealing with international data partners. In short, this rule requires U.S. companies to be able to identify any transaction that could allow access to covered data by a foreign entity, in particular from China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela.\\n\\n**_Children’s Privacy Violations_**. In August 2024, the DOJ, with [urging from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/06/statement-commission-regarding-tiktok-complaint-referral-doj) and Congress, [filed a civil lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-tiktok-and-parent-company-bytedance-widespread-violations-childrens) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against a social media company over violations of children’s privacy laws. Allegations include unauthorized data collection, application of digital tools to surveil minors, and other non-compliance with COPPA. In particular, according to the complaint, from 2019 to the present the company knowingly permitted children to create regular accounts (i.e., not accounts created in the so-called “Kids Mode”) and interact with adults, collected their personal information without parental consent (even for those accounts which were created in Kids Mode), and failed to delete this data upon parental request, while having inadequate policies to manage children’s accounts. The complaint further alleges that the company also violated a 2019 Permanent injunction, in part by neglecting its mandate to preserve records about activities from minors below the age of 13 on the platform.\\n\\n**_Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative_**. [Initiated in 2021](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-new-civil-cyber-fraud-initiative), the DOJ’s Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative (CCFI), which is intended to encourage disclosure and to hold accountable entities and individuals that put U.S. information or information systems at risk by knowingly providing deficient cybersecurity products or services, misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, or violating obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches, gained significant momentum in 2024, leading to multiple [settlements](https://www.gibsondunn.com/false-claims-act-2023-year-end-update/) with government contractors and private companies accused of failing to meet cybersecurity standards.[[103]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn103) Such failure to comply can take multiple forms, including outright violations of legal provisions, falsified cybersecurity certificates, or an inability to fulfill contractual obligations.\\n\\nWhile multiple cases concerning disputes over compliance with federal cybersecurity requirements have been settled, United States ex rel. [Craig v. Georgia Tech Research Corp](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/united-states-files-suit-against-georgia-institute-technology-and-georgia-tech-research) remained ongoing, supported by an intervention from the DOJ in August 2024, at the time of the publication of this article. Companies contracting with the US Government must adhere to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity frameworks to mitigate enforcement risks (also, see below, section A.5.c. Department of Commerce).\\n\\n**_Cybercrime and Dark Web Marketplaces_**. The DOJ has intensified efforts to enforce against [cybercrimes](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8932-24) relating to cryptocurrencies, and dismantle [cybercrime marketplaces](https://www.gibsondunn.com/gibson-dunn-digital-assets-recent-updates-january-2025/) selling stolen data, hacking tools, or illicit goods. Key operations included the [takedowns of the dark web marketplaces Nulled and Cracked](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cracked-and-nulled-marketplaces-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) (which impacted at least 17 million victims from the United States), and the [takedown of Rydox](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/rydox-cybercrime-marketplace-shut-down-and-three-administrators-arrested) (which sold, amongst others, sensitive data from thousands of victims residing in the United States), along with [arrests](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/incognito-market-owner-arrested-operating-one-largest-illegal-narcotics-marketplaces) regarding [Incognito Market](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/incognito-market-owner-pleads-guilty-operating-one-largest-illegal-narcotics), an extensive dark web effort to traffic illicit drugs to the United States and around the world.\\n\\nFurthermore, the DOJ, often in collaboration with international partners, also successfully targeted ransomware groups responsible for major cyberattacks, including, amongst others:\\n\\n*   [Together with its international partners](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant) and the FBI, the DOJ disrupted the [LockBit ransomware group,](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware) one of the most active ransomware groups in the world that has targeted over 2,000 victims, received more than USD 120 million in ransom payments, and made ransom demands totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. Actions against LockBit included seizing numerous websites and servers managed by LockBit administrators. These were complemented by indictments against key figures, the issuing of the search warrants, and the development of decryption capabilities to restore systems encrypted by the LockBit ransomware variant.\\n*   An alleged North Korean government-affiliated cybercriminal [was charged](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/north-korean-government-hacker-charged-involvement-ransomware-attacks-targeting-us-hospitals) for attacks targeting U.S. hospitals and critical infrastructure.\\n\\n> > > **c. Department of Commerce**\\n\\nIn October 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), through the Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Office of Information and Communications Technology and Services (OICTS), issued [a landmark decision](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-us-customers) prohibiting the use of Kaspersky’s antivirus software and cybersecurity products in the United States or by U.S. persons, “_due to the Russian Government’s offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations_.” The decision marked the first time OICTS exercised its authority with regards to Information and Communications Technology and Services (ICTS) supply chain regulations. While it was based on an interim final rule implementing an Executive Order from the Biden administration, the [corresponding final rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/06/2024-28335/securing-the-information-and-communications-technology-and-services-supply-chain) was issued in December 2024.\\n\\nAdditionally, cybersecurity risks stemming from supply chains have in particular been under heightened scrutiny of the DOC—although the [impact of the new Trump administration](https://www.gibsondunn.com/impact-of-trump-administration-regulatory-freeze-memorandum-selected-regulations-and-agency-actions/) on these remains to be seen:\\n\\n*   For example, the BIS [issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious) regarding a rule banning the import and sale of connected vehicles from China (including Hong Kong) and Russia, citing risks related to espionage, cyber threats, and unauthorized data collection, which has been finalized while still under the Biden administration on 19 January 2025. The rule also restricts key vehicle software and hardware deemed to pose “undue or unacceptable risks” to national security, with certain software restrictions beginning in 2027 and hardware restrictions following in 2029.\\n*   Furthermore, BIS has [announced an Export Control Framework](https://www.bis.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-announces-regulatory-framework-responsible-diffusion) to further strengthen the U.S.’s cybersecurity capabilities from a hardware perspective. The framework is aimed at limiting the spread of advanced artificial intelligence technologies while tightening restrictions on advanced computing. It specifically imposes strict controls on the export, reexport, and transfer of advanced computing integrated circuits and the model weights of leading AI systems.\\n*   BIS has also [proposed a new rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious) imposing restrictions on U.S. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers, in particular cloud service providers, concerning their role in training large AI models. The rule would require IaaS providers to implement Customer Identification Programs (CIPs) to collect “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information, and is ultimately aimed at preventing foreign adversaries from accessing advanced AI capabilities.\\n\\nSeparately, in February 2024, the DOC’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [released Version 2.0 of its Cybersecurity Framework (](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework)[CSF](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework)[)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework). The updated CSF is now organized around six key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, along with CSF 2.0’s newly added “_Govern_” function, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity governance and risk management. It also now addresses explicitly all organizations and not just those in critical infrastructure, its original target audience.\\n\\nLastly, in December 2024, the DOC [released a strategic report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/The-Decisive-Decade-Advancing-National-Security-at-the-Department-of-Commerce.pdf) titled “_The Decisive Decade: Advancing National Security at the Department of Commerce_.” The report outlines key policy objectives in the digital space, emphasizing U.S. leadership in critical technologies, international security collaborations, and private-sector partnerships to enhance cybersecurity. It serves as a roadmap for maintaining economic security and technological dominance while addressing threats from foreign adversaries.\\n\\n> > > **d. Department of Energy**\\n\\nCybersecurity continues to be a point of emphasis underpinning power systems and critical infrastructure resilience. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released and endorsed various implementation strategies and adoption guidelines intended to drive the voluntary adoption of uniform cybersecurity practices across the energy sector.\\n\\nIn March 2024, the DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) partnered with the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissions (NARUC) to publish “[Cybersecurity Baselines](https://www.naruc.org/core-sectors/critical-infrastructure-and-cybersecurity/cybersecurity-for-utility-regulators/cybersecurity-baselines/)” for distributed energy resources (DERs) and their electric distribution systems. Intended for asset scoping and baseline prioritization, the Cybersecurity Baselines are intended to enhance system resilience and provide a starting point from which a solid cybersecurity foundation can be built and later expanded upon, following a risk-informed roadmap. The final version of the accompanying Implementation Guidance is expected [to be published in mid-2025](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/articles/protecting-energy-infrastructure-ceser-partners-publish-cybersecurity-guidance).\\n\\nCybersecurity also remains a critical pillar of DOE’s [efforts to protect clean energy](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/articles/doe-funds-new-cyber-research-protect-clean-energy-infrastructure) infrastructure. In particular, a key focus has been [modernizing and securing](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/fleet-modernization-maintenance-and-cybersecurity) U.S. hydropower plants, which is central to the DOE’s cybersecurity strategy. The DOE has also issued several cybersecurity guidelines, [including those for energy procurement](https://www.energy.gov/femp/cybersecurity-considerations-procurement) and introduced [new Supply Chain Cybersecurity Principles](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-leads-effort-improve-cybersecurity-energy-supply-chains), developed in collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory.\\n\\nIn addition, the [Energy Threat Analysis Center](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2024/11/energy-departments-etac-cyber-threat-center-goes-operational/) (ETAC)—a public-private partnership that convenes experts from the federal government and the U.S. energy sector—became operational in Q4 2024. Jointly managed by CESER and the DOE’s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, and in partnership with the national laboratories, and in close coordination with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), [it is aimed at strengthening](https://www.energy.gov/ceser/energy-threat-analysis-center-0) the collective defense, response, and resilience of the U.S. energy sector, improve national security in the energy sector, enhance analysis capabilities and facilitate an increased sharing of information.\\n\\nIn addition to providing external guidance and support, the DOE has also continued efforts to [enhance its own cybersecurity](https://www.energy.gov/topics/cybersecurity) following recent cyberattacks. In particular, in January 2024, the DOE issued its [Cybersecurity Strategy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/EXEC-2023-007090%20-%20DOE%20Cybersecurity%20Strategy%20SB%20S2%20CIO%20012224_508%20Reviewed.pdf). Other governmental bodies also highlighted the importance of the DOE and its mission to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure as well as ensuring supply chain security. For example, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) noted that a [crucial role for this will fall on](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/DOE-OIG-25-05.pdf) the recently established Vetting Center, where a Vetting Center Policy Group has been established in 2024. Assessing the outcome of this will be crucial for contractors and vendors doing business with the DOE, as they should anticipate increased emphasis on and scrutiny of their cybersecurity practices in 2025.\\n\\n> > > **e. Department of Defense**\\n\\nIn October 2024, the Department of Defense (DoD) finalized a much anticipated rule implementing its Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program for defense contractors, broadly aimed at increasing the security of controlled, unclassified information within the defense industry.[[104]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn104) The CMMC will set three “levels” of cybersecurity requirements based on the nature of information held by contractors, with the aim of creating a baseline level of cybersecurity for almost all DoD contract solicitations. These requirements include confirming that Cloud Service Providers used by contractors meet certain risk standards, protocol for processing, storing, and transmitting controlled unclassified information; and submitting annual compliance self-assessments.\\n\\nIn addition to enhancing the cybersecurity of its supply chain, the DoD announced its plan to prioritize strengthening its [Defense Industrial Base](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/28/2003424523/-1/-1/1/DOD_DOB_CS_STRATEGY_DSD_SIGNED_20240325.PDF) (DIB), which is a network of foreign companies and organizations that support the DoD and other U.S. defense requirements. In March 2024, the DoD [announced](https://industrialcyber.co/threats-attacks/dod-cio-debuts-cybersecurity-reciprocity-playbook-to-streamline-system-authorizations-boost-cybersecurity-efficiency/)[a cybersecurity strategy](https://industrialcyber.co/threats-attacks/dod-cio-debuts-cybersecurity-reciprocity-playbook-to-streamline-system-authorizations-boost-cybersecurity-efficiency/) aimed at improving the DIB’s cybersecurity capabilities and its IT interoperability and integration with the DoD, and in May 2024, the DoD’s Chief Information Officer released a [playbook](https://industrialcyber.co/threats-attacks/dod-cio-debuts-cybersecurity-reciprocity-playbook-to-streamline-system-authorizations-boost-cybersecurity-efficiency/) for implementing shared security authorization packages across DoD systems to make system assessments more efficient. In June 2024, the Pentagon released a [blueprint](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3817169/dod-releases-strategy-to-achieve-it-integration-interoperability/) for the DoD to prioritize providing joint warfighting IT capabilities between U.S. forces and mission partners, modernizing information networks, optimizing IT governance, and cultivating a digital workforce.\\n\\n> > > **f. Federal Communications Commission**\\n\\n[As noted in the 2023 update](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-outlook-and-review-2024/), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced its new Privacy and Data Protection Task Force in June 2023. Since its inception, the Task Force has been active in various enforcement and [rule](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400393A1.pdf)[–](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400393A1.pdf)[making efforts](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400393A1.pdf).\\n\\n**_Enforcement_**. The FCC also levied large fines and settled several claims related to company data practices. In April 2024, the [FCC fined American wireless carriers](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402213A1.pdf) nearly $200 million for allegedly sharing their customers’ location data without consent. The FCC Enforcement Bureau investigation found that the carriers sold location data access to aggregators, who then resold the access to third parties, in an alleged attempt to offload their obligation to obtain customer consent.\\n\\n[In June 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-403233A1.pdf), a leading Latin American telecommunications company agreed to pay $100,000 to resolve allegations that the company failed to report a data breach in a timely manner in violation of FCC rules and conditions of Liberty’s license. [In July 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-403803A1.pdf), the FCC announced a $34.6 million settlement and consent decree with a phone captioning company to resolve allegations that the company unlawfully retained call content beyond the duration allowed and submitted inaccurate information to the Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) Fund Administrator. [Also in July 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404156A1.pdf), the FCC announced a $16 million settlement with an American wireless prepaid service provider to resolve allegations that the company failed to reasonably protect customer information in connection with multiple data breaches. [In September 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405545A1.pdf), a major American wireless carrier entered into a $13 million settlement with the FCC regarding a data breach of a cloud vendor for the carrier, exposing customer information that the vendor was supposed to have destroyed. The FCC faulted the carrier for failing to ensure the vendor had destroyed the data. [Also in September 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-405937A1.pdf), another major American wireless carrier reached a $31.5 million settlement with the FCC to resolve investigations into multiple data breaches, including access to the names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers for 47.8 current, former, and prospective customers. The $31.5 million settlement consisted of a $15.75 million penalty and a $15.75 million investment by the carrier into its cybersecurity infrastructure.\\n\\n**_TCPA Rulemaking_**. The FCC [continued its focus on curtailing robocalls and robotexts](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-400522A1.pdf) by adopting new rules in February 2024. While previous rules have made it clear that consumers have a right to revoke their consent to receive automated calls and messages, the new rules require that revocation requests be honored within a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 business days from receipt. The rules also codified the FCC’s previous ruling that consumers can revoke their consent through any reasonable means.\\n\\nApproved in December 2023, TCPA rules requiring lead generators, comparison shopping websites, and similar companies to obtain a consumer’s prior express written consent to receive automated calls from each marketing partner went into effect on January 25, 2025.[[105]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn105) A February 3, 2025 decision from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently vacated this “one-to-one consent rule” under the TCPA, which may create uncertainty for other recent TCPA regulations.[[106]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn106)\\n\\n**_Cyber Trust Mark_**. [In March 2024](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401201A1.pdf), the FCC voted to create a voluntary cybersecurity labeling program for devices that meet certain cybersecurity and privacy standards. Qualifying products will bear a label including a new “U.S. Cyber Trust Mark” to help consumers differentiate trustworthy products and will also include a scannable QR code with additional product information. Examples of eligible products include smart home appliances and fitness trackers.\\n\\n> > **6. State Agencies**\\n\\nState attorneys general continued to lead the charge as privacy regulators in 2024, enforcing both existing consumer protection laws and comprehensive data privacy laws that an increasing number of states are enacting. Attorneys general have not been alone in their work, however, as other state agencies, including new dedicated privacy regulatory agencies, work in tandem with attorneys general. State agencies and state attorneys general are expected to be particularly active and continue the trend in 2025 in light of the Trump administration’s predicted reduction in enforcement activity at the federal level.\\n\\n> > > **a. California**\\n\\n> > > > **i. California Privacy Protection Agency**\\n\\nIn 2024, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) [began to take a more active role](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20240326.html) in privacy regulation and enforcement in California. In January 2024, the agency launched a [website](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20240118.html) dedicated to enlightening the public regarding privacy rights and, throughout the year, [announced partnerships](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20240625.html) and [initiatives](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20240326.html) related to strengthening privacy protections. The [CPPA also published](https://cppa.ca.gov/pdf/enfadvisory202401.pdf) its first two California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [enforcement advisories](https://cppa.ca.gov/pdf/enfadvisory202402.pdf), addressing the application of data minimization to consumer requests and avoidance of dark patterns, respectively. Along with the enforcement advisories, the CPPA and AG have issued confidential notices of violation to various companies, including, but not limited to the scope of their enforcement advisories.\\n\\nAdditionally, the CPPA announced changes to its leadership. After over three years leading the [CPPA](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241108.html), Executive Director Ashkan Soltani stepped down from his position, effective January 2025. Tiffany Garcia, the former Chief Deputy Executive Director of the [CPPA](https://cppa.ca.gov/about_us/), will serve as Interim Executive Director until a permanent replacement is named. Before joining the CPPA, Garcia served for four years as Deputy Secretary for Fiscal Policy and Administration at the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency.\\n\\nOn January 1, 2024, the California Department of Justice transferred administrative responsibility for the state’s data broker registry to the [CPPA](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/data_broker_regulations.html). In October 2024, the CPPA [announced](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241030.html) a public investigative sweep of data broker registration compliance. The CPPA subsequently announced a [series of settlement agreements](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241114.html) with data brokers [resolving claims](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241223.html) that the companies failed to [register and pay required fees](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2025/20250129.html), which is subject to a $200 fine per day. In December 2024, the CPPA [voted to adopt](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241108_2.html)[regulations](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/pdf/data_broker_reg_fee.pdf) substantially increasing the fees for data broker registration from $400 to $6,600 and clarifying procedural requirements under California’s Delete Act, which requires data brokers to register with the CPPA.\\n\\nIn November, the CPPA advanced draft CCPA [regulations](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2024/20241108_2.html) on cybersecurity audits, risk assessments, and automated decisionmaking technology (ADMT) to the formal rulemaking process. The [notice and comment period](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/ccpa_updates.html) was open from November 22, 2024 until February 19, 2025. In addition to adding rights and requirements for the use of ADMT (described in detail in the ), the proposed regulations would revise the existing CCPA regulations to require businesses to conduct cybersecurity audits and risk assessments. These changes include an expansion of the definition of sensitive personal information, additional requirements for implementing consumer rights, and updates to the opt-out framework. Gibson Dunn has  laying out the significant issues with the draft regulations.\\n\\n> > > > **ii. California Attorney General**\\n\\nThough the CPPA has begun privacy enforcement in California, the California Attorney General (CA AG) continued to play an active role in enforcing the CCPA in 2024. In January 2024, the CA AG announced an [investigative sweep](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-investigative-sweep-focuses-streaming-services%E2%80%99) focused on streaming services. The CA AG also announced two settlement agreements under the CCPA in 2024. The [first](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-settlement-doordash-investigation-finds-company), with a major tech company, handled by Gibson Dunn, addressed the CCPA’s requirement that a business disclose and provide consumers the right to opt out of the selling or sharing of their personal information. The settlement agreement required a low settlement penalty of $375,000 and injunctive terms that reiterated existing requirements of the law but notably did not require any changes to business practices. The second [settlement](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-la-city-attorney-feldstein-soto-announce-500000), which the CA AG brought with the Los Angeles City Attorney, resolved claims that a mobile game company violated the CCPA and COPPA by failing to obtain parental consent for collecting and sharing children’s data from a mobile app. In addition to a $500,000 civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires the company to obtain consent for processing children’s and teen’s personal information, provide a just-in-time notice when children’s data is sold or shared, and properly configure third-party software-development kits to comply with children’s data legal requirements.\\n\\n> > > **b. Other State Agencies**\\n\\nIn 2024, state attorneys general in other states began to enforce their recently enacted state comprehensive privacy laws and build out privacy enforcement infrastructure. For example:\\n\\n*   The Texas Attorney General (Texas AG) has been particularly active in enforcing Texas’s data protection laws. In June 2024, the Texas AG announced the launch of a [data privacy and security initiative](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-data-privacy-and-security-initiative-protect-texans-sensitive), establishing a dedicated data privacy protection team. Focused on the sale of geolocation data, the Texas AG opened an [investigation](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-opens-investigation-car-manufacturers-collection-and-sale-drivers-data) into car manufacturers’ collection and sale of driver data and subsequently brought a [lawsuit](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-general-motors-unlawfully-collecting-drivers-private-data-and) against a car manufacturer under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The Texas AG issued [notices of violation](https://therecord.media/texas-attorney-general-data-privacy-notices-siriusxm-apps-companies) to multiple other companies for allegedly sharing sensitive user data without proper notice and consent under the recently effective [Texas Data Privacy and Security Act](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/texas-data-privacy-and-security-act) and [notifications](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-notifies-over-100-companies-their-apparent-failure-comply-texas-data) of apparent failure to register as data brokers to over 100 companies a few months after the close of the Texas Data Broker Law’s [initial registration period](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-notifies-over-100-companies-their-apparent-failure-comply-texas-data). Gibson Dunn has advised clients in response to many confidential investigations and notices over the past year. The Texas AG also filed a [complaint](https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-tiktok-sharing-minors-personal-data-violation-texas-parental) against a popular social media platform under the SCOPE Act, alleging that the company failed to obtain parental consent before sharing, disclosing, or selling a minor’s personal information and failed to offer required parental controls.\\n*   In February 2024, the Connecticut Attorney General (CT AG) published a [report](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/ag/press_releases/2024/ctdpa-final-report.pdf) describing enforcement actions under the Connecticut Data Privacy Act in the first six months since the law took effect. The report states that the CT AG has issued numerous warning letters, received 30 complaints, issued inquiries and cure notices addressing deficiencies in privacy policies, sensitive data, teen data, and data brokers.\\n*   In December 2024, the Colorado Department of Law [adopted rules](https://coag.gov/colorado-privacy-act-rulemaking/) updating language in the Colorado Privacy Act Regulations to include newly adopted definitions of biometrics and adding a process for issuing opinions and guidance. Additionally, as part of a roll-out process, the Colorado Attorney General [recognized Global Privacy Control](https://coag.gov/opt-out/) (GPC) as the first universal opt-out mechanism to meet the CPA’s standards, and required businesses to implement GPC opt-outs by July 2024.\\n*   The Oregon and Virginia Attorneys General have initiated confidential investigations into compliance with their newly effective state privacy laws, some of which have been handled by Gibson Dunn.\\n*   Ahead of the January 1, 2025 effective date of the [New Hampshire Data Privacy Act](https://gc.nh.gov/rsa/html/LII/507-H/507-H-mrg.htm), the New Hampshire Department of Justice announced the creation of a [data privacy unit](https://www.doj.nh.gov/news-and-media/attorney-general-formella-announces-creation-new-data-privacy-unit?trk=feed_main-feed-card_feed-article-content). Delaware created a [Personal Data Privacy Portal](https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/fraud/personal-data-privacy-portal/) in anticipation of the [Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act](https://www.dwt.com/-/media/files/blogs/privacy-and-security-blog/2023/09/hb154.pdf?rev=321cd002978d46af8627810701fa6e94&hash=D1F4C97C319DEC01B1EB7411D60712FA), which also took effect January 1, 2025.\\n\\n**III. Civil Litigation Regarding Privacy and Data Security**\\n\\n> **A. Data Breach Litigation**\\n\\nData breaches and cybersecurity incidents have continued to pose a threat to businesses, resulting in substantial economic losses and putting companies at risk of litigation. According to the Identity Theft Research Center (ITRC), although there were fewer data breaches in 2024 than in 2023—2,850 as opposed to 3,122 total data breaches—[due to the scale of some of the 2024 breaches](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2024-annual-data-breach-report-near-record-compromises/), the number of data breach victims actually [increased by 257% from 2023.](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/) We summarize a few of the notable data breach suits below.\\n\\nA large telecommunications company faced multiple class action lawsuits stemming from a data breach that allegedly resulted in the exposure of approximately 73 million account holders’ personal data.[[107]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn107) These class actions have now been transferred to and consolidated in the Northern District of Texas, alleging claims for, among other things, negligence, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.[[108]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn108) The class actions also allege that the telecommunications company violated state consumer protection laws, deceptive and unfair trade practices laws, and personal consumer information laws.[[109]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn109)\\n\\nA federal court denied a pharmaceutical wholesaler’s motion to dismiss, finding that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded standing in seeking damages for the risk of future harm resulting from a data breach.[[110]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn110)[Specifically, the court found](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/I38623c60f0ab11ee807ff5b396b939d4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(oc.Default)) that, because the plaintiff had pleaded actual attempted misuse, standing had been adequately pleaded, even though the attempted misuse was prevented by the Social Security Administration.[[111]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn111)\\n\\n[A pair of recent decisions](https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/Ia335cee0a39211ef885bb2e066a069e7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(oc.Default)) also provide insight into the role that fiduciary duty claims play in data breach litigation. In November 2024, the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed a lower court dismissal of a data breach class action against a management consulting firm, which had allegedly collected sensitive personal and health information from employees, patients, and vendors; and where the submission of sensitive personal information is a pre-requisite for employment.[[112]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn112) The court [affirmed the dismissal of the case](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ia335cee0a39211ef885bb2e066a069e7/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0) due to lack of standing and failure to sufficiently plead claims, including because the plaintiff failed to plead that a fiduciary duty existed between her and her former employer.[[113]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn113) Specifically, the court held that while Griggs argued that as NHS has influence and dominion over Griggs and her data, under Alabama precedent, a principal or employer is not the fiduciary of the agent or employee, and Griggs failed to provide any support for the court to provide an exception in her case. In a July 2024 decision out of the Northern District of Georgia, a court found that a plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded evidence to show a fiduciary relationship existed between a company that retained health information.[[114]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn114) Unlike the Alabama case, the Georgia case did not involve an employer-employee relationship. The Northern District of Georgia court allowed breach of fiduciary duty claims, determining that “in some circumstances, the retention of private information that patients provided while seeking medical care can create a fiduciary duty under Georgia law.”[[115]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn115) Additionally, 2024 saw a number of significant data breach settlements that will shape what new cases are filed and negotiation in existing cases:\\n\\n*   A health network agreed to a $65 million [settlement](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2024/09/12/792600.htm), which was later approved by the court, to resolve the claims of nearly 135,000 patients and employees whose personal data was breached due to a ransomware attack, including more than 600 patients who had their personal medical-record photos posted on the internet after the health network refused to pay the ransom.\\n*   A personal genomics company agreed to a $30 million [settlement](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1879177/23andme-inks-30m-data-breach-deal-with-6-4m-users-in-mdl) to resolve a multi-district class action brought on behalf of more than six million customers who claimed that their personal data was stolen, including, for a small set of customers, information about their health based on the analysis of their genetic data.\\n*   A mobile payment company and its subsidiary agreed to a $15 million [settlement](https://www.law360.com/articles/1809699/attachments/0) to settle claims stemming from two separate data breaches, one by a former employee and [another](https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/4813905-cash-app-settlement-are-you-eligible-to-claim-up-to-2500/) by third parties that used old phone numbers to access users’ accounts, that allegedly exposed the personally identifiable information, account numbers, and trading activity of more than 8.2 million users.\\n\\n> **B. Wiretapping and Related Litigation Concerning Online “Tracking” Technologies**\\n\\nThe flood of lawsuits brought under federal and state wiretapping statutes continued in 2024, with hundreds of cases being filed, frequently by the same plaintiff law firms. Many technology companies offer web- and app-based tools (such as software development kits, pixels, chat features, or similar tools) that web and app developers can use to track users’ activity on their website or app. Plaintiffs have brought lawsuits alleging that the use of these tools in a variety of different sectors (such as healthcare, video, finance, and more) violates federal and state wiretapping statutes by “recording” (or “eavesdropping” on) plaintiffs’ activity on websites and apps (which plaintiffs characterize as their “communications” with web and app developers). For example, plaintiffs have alleged that third-party technology companies were able to “wiretap” and “eavesdrop” on their online chat communications with businesses through the technology used to implement those chat features.[[116]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn116) Some of these lawsuits were filed directly against the developers that own the websites and apps at issue.[[117]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn117) Others were filed against the companies that offer this technology to web and app developers and allegedly receive the communications at-issue.[[118]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn118)\\n\\nAs described in [last year’s Review](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-outlook-and-review-2024/), the plaintiffs in these cases often bring claims under both the federal Wiretap Act and state wiretapping laws, which can carry high penalties for violations. The federal Wiretap Act is a one-party consent statute, so there is no liability if even one party to a communication consents to share it unless the communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing a crime or tortious act.[[119]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn119) The Act provides for statutory damages consisting of $100 a day for each day of violation or $10,000, whichever is greater.[[120]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn120) Some states have adopted more restrictive two-party (or all-party) consent statutes while also providing for high statutory damages. For example, California’s wiretapping and eavesdropping laws prohibit wiretapping or eavesdropping on communications without the consent of all parties involved and provide for $5,000 in statutory damages per violation.[[121]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn121)\\n\\nThese claims continue to be especially difficult to defend against at early stages of the case, as courts in 2024 have sometimes refused to consider a defendant’s privacy policy to show consent at the motion-to-dismiss stage.[[122]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn122) A significant number of these cases have continued to survive past the pleadings stage, though several others have been dismissed outright.[[123]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn123) In one significant decision, a California federal district court dismissed wiretapping and other privacy-based claims against a technology company**based on the plaintiffs’ failure to plausibly allege that the company intended for third parties to use its pixel technology to send sensitive health information** (contrary to the company’s instructions).[[124]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn124) This decision teed up an intra-District split on the proper standard for assessing intent for wiretapping claims in the Northern District of California, where many of these cases are brought.[[125]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn125) In addition, the caselaw has continued to develop regarding what sort of harm plaintiffs must show to pursue a claim, with some courts finding a statutory violation sufficient (based on an asserted privacy injury)[[126]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn126) and others requiring more in light of a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision.[[127]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn127)\\n\\nThere were more decisions in 2024 at the summary judgment stage as well, with mixed results. For example, a California federal court granted summary judgment for the defendant web developer on the plaintiff’s California wiretapping claim.[[128]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn128) The plaintiff alleged the defendant violated California’s wiretapping statute when she visited the defendant’s website, because her keystrokes were recorded by computer code embedded on the website.[[129]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn129) The plaintiff claimed that this recording violated the California wiretapping statute’s prohibition on “read[ing] or attempt[ing] to read or learn the contents or meaning of electronic communications” without the consent of all parties to the communication.[[130]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn130) The court held the defendant did not “read, attempt to read, or to learn the contents or meaning” of the communications because the keystrokes were immediately “hashed,” or transformed into an “incomprehensible alphanumeric string called a hash,” and the unhashed information was not retained anywhere.[[131]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn131) As another example, another California federal court granted summary judgment for the defendant social media companies on the plaintiffs’ federal and California wiretapping claims.[[132]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn132) The plaintiffs alleged the defendants’ web-based tools collected and sent their information when they visited websites that used those tools.[[133]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn133) The court held plaintiffs had not produced any evidence that the defendants had intercepted the “contents” of their communications as required under the federal and California wiretapping claims, and that even if plaintiffs had done so, it did not appear the defendants had obtained any communications “during transmission” as to one of the two tools.[[134]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn134) By contrast, another California federal court denied in substantial part a technology company’s motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their private health information entered into a period-tracking app was surreptitiously shared with the technology company through the company’s software development kit embedded on the app.[[135]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn135) The court permitted the plaintiffs’ federal and California wiretapping claims to proceed, finding “factual disputes” existed regarding “the alleged transmission of data via [the defendant]’s SDK, and its subsequent use vel non.”[[136]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn136)\\n\\nIn 2024, certain tracking technology cases also reached preliminary or final settlements encompassing wiretapping claims. For example, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for final approval of the parties’ proposed class action settlement in a case based on a technology company’s purported surreptitious tracking of users’ web-browsing activity even when users browsed in “Incognito mode.”[[137]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn137) Included as part of this “groundbreaking settlement that yields substantial benefits” for class members are the technology company’s agreements to rewrite its disclosures to inform users that it collects private browsing data, to “delete and/or remediate billions of data records that reflect class members’ private browsing activities,” and to permit users in Incognito mode to block third-party cookies by default.[[138]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn138) Under the terms of the settlement, class members retain their right to sue the defendant individually for damages, including for the “significant statutory damages available under the federal and state wiretap statutes.”[[139]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn139)\\n\\n> **C. Anti-Hacking and Computer Intrusion Statutes**\\n\\nThe federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) generally makes it unlawful to “intentionally access a computer without authorization” or to “exceed[] authorized access.”[[140]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn140) As described in [last year’s Review](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-outlook-and-review-2024/), the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in _Van Buren v. United States_, 593 U.S. 374 (2021), subsequent cases, and the Department of Justice’s decision in 2022 to narrow its CFAA enforcement policies have limited the CFAA’s legal and practical scope. Decisions this past year have continued to grapple with the proper scope of the CFAA and similar state statutes, such as California’s Comprehensive Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA).\\n\\n> > **1. CFAA**\\n\\nIn 2024, courts continued to confront questions about the scope of “authorization” under the CFAA. For example, in July 2024, a federal jury in Delaware found that an online travel agency violated the CFAA by using an airline’s website without authorization or in excess of its authorized access.[[141]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn141) The airline characterized the travel agency’s unauthorized use of its website as “screen scraping,” which the airline defined as “using an ‘automated system or software . . . to extract data from [the airline’s] website for commercial purposes,’ such as selling [the airline’s] flights on websites other than [the airline]’s.”[[142]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn142) According to the airline, the travel agency continued screen scraping even after the airline sent cease-and-desist letters and developed a program to block such unauthorized activity.[[143]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn143) The jury awarded $5,000 to the airline, which represented the amount of “actual economic harm” caused by the travel agency’s violation of the CFAA.[[144]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn144) Following the jury verdict, the travel agency filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, arguing in part that the airline failed to prove that it suffered a loss of at least $5,000 in any one-year period, as required under the CFAA.[[145]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn145) The court agreed, granting judgment in favor of the travel agency.[[146]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn146) The court entered an amended judgment in accordance with its ruling on January 31, 2025.[[147]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn147) This was one of the [first civil trials](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2024/07/30/first-ever-civil-computer-fraud-act-case-lands-in-favor-of-ryanair/?slreturn=20250131130254) involving a CFAA claim.\\n\\nOther 2024 decisions similarly addressed the meaning of “authorization” under the statute. In a case before the Sixth Circuit, an IT administrator created company email accounts for potential buyers of the company to use.[[148]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn148) When the potential purchase fell through, the IT administrator searched the buyers’ email accounts to preserve certain emails for litigation purposes.[[149]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn149) The Sixth Circuit held that the IT administrator’s actions were not “without authorization” because, as the manager of the email accounts, he had undisputed authorization to access them.[[150]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn150) The Sixth Circuit next considered whether the IT administrator’s actions “exceed[ed] authorization,” observing that “[d]etermining the parameters of authorization . . . is not always easy to pin down.”[[151]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn151) But the court ultimately did not decide the issue, finding the IT administrator did not violate the statute because the CFAA prohibits only “intentionally” exceeding unauthorized access, and the administrator “lack[ed] notice that his access [was] unauthorized.”[[152]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn152) The Sixth Circuit thus affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendants.\\n\\nAs another example, in a federal Idaho case, a company alleged that three of its former employees improperly accessed its internal healthcare record system to obtain confidential and proprietary information to form a competing business.[[153]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn153) While they were employed by the company, the three defendants were all issued credentials to access the system.[[154]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn154) After one defendant was fired, he allegedly increased another defendant’s permissions in the system, which the latter defendant used to access material he was not otherwise authorized to access. The court pointed to _Van Buren v. United States_, 593 U.S. 374 (2021), noting the Supreme Court had indicated “the question of authorized access is a ‘gates-up-or-down inquiry—one either can or cannot access a computer system, and one either can or cannot access certain areas within the system.’”[[155]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn155) The court went on to note that the Supreme Court “left open the issue of ‘whether [the authorization] inquiry turns only on technology (or ‘code-based’) limitations on access, or instead also looks to limits contained in contracts or policies.’”[[156]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn156) Because one defendant had allegedly wrongfully expanded the other defendant’s access beyond what was authorized, the court held it could not conclude at the motion-to-dismiss stage that such conduct fell outside the scope of the CFAA.\\n\\n> > **2. CDAFA**\\n\\nCourts have also grappled with issues under state-law analogs to the CFAA, which plaintiffs sometimes invoke alongside wiretapping and other privacy-related claims. One such statute, the CDAFA, is California’s version of the CFAA, and its provisions “generally prohibit[] tampering, interference, damage, and unauthorized access to lawfully created computer data and computer systems.”[[157]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn157) The CDAFA creates a private right of action against any person who commits certain listed violations “for compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief.”[[158]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn158) “Access” under the statute means to “cause output from” the “logical, arithmetical, or memory function resources of a computer.”[[159]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn159) Only someone who has “suffer[ed] damage or loss by reason of a violation” of the statute may bring a civil action.[[160]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn160)\\n\\nAs was the case last year, in 2024, several district courts considered CDAFA claims as part of the recent wave of litigation related to website tracking technologies. Of particular note is what appears to be a growing divide among the district courts on the issue of whether the loss of value in a plaintiff’s data can qualify as “damage or loss” under the statute.\\n\\nMost courts have held that the loss of value of personal data is not enough to show “damage or loss” under the CDAFA.[[161]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn161) For example, a California district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ CDAFA claim in a case where the plaintiff alleged her interactions with her medical center’s online patient portal, including her private medical data, were surreptitiously forwarded to certain third parties due to the center’s use of tracking pixels on its website.[[162]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn162) The plaintiff argued the loss of value of her data constituted “damage or loss” under the CDAFA. The court rejected that argument, holding that the “loss of the right to control [one’s] data, the loss of the value of [one’s] data, and the loss of the right to protection of the data” are not losses covered by the CDAFA.[[163]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn163)\\n\\nSome courts, however, have accepted the lost-value-of-data theory. For example, in a federal California case, the plaintiff alleged that his personal information entered into a chat feature on the defendant’s website was surreptitiously shared with other companies due to the code used to support the chat feature.[[164]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn164) The court declined to dismiss the plaintiff’s CDAFA claim, holding the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that the defendant “has a stake in the value of his misappropriated data.”[[165]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn165) The court pointed to the Ninth Circuit’s decision in _In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litigation_, 956 F.3d 589 (9th Cir. 2020), for support, reasoning that the Ninth Circuit had found the plaintiffs in that case “had sufficiently alleged their [data] carried financial value” under the CDAFA.[[166]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn166)\\n\\n> **D. Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation**\\n\\nOriginally enacted in 1991, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) regulates certain forms of telemarketing activities and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems (ATDS).[[167]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn167) TCPA litigation historically centered on issues concerning the technical definition of an ATDS, but in 2021, the Supreme Court clarified and restricted the definition in its 2021 opinion in _Facebook Inc. v. Duguid_, in which the Court endorsed a narrow definition that limited the definition of ATDS to devices that store or produce telephone numbers by using a random or sequential number generator.[[168]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn168) With the definition of an ATDS largely resolved, the interpretation of other key provisions in the TCPA has become the focus of ongoing litigation.\\n\\nIn one notable decision in 2024, the Fourth Circuit reversed a motion to dismiss a putative class action, holding that the plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to state a claim that the defendant’s fax invitation to attend a free webinar constituted an “unsolicited advertisement” under the TCPA.[[169]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn169) The court held that it is reasonable to infer that the free webinar had a “commercial character,” even though specific products were not mentioned in the fax.[[170]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn170) The court further reasoned that, by accepting the defendant’s fax invitation, the plaintiff would have potentially provided contact information and consent to future promotional materials—which gave the fax the requisite “commercial nexus” to the defendant’s business.[[171]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn171)\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Fourth Circuit held in a different case that the TCPA does not apply to faxes that are received through online fax services.[[172]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn172) The court reasoned that because an online fax service does not receive an electronic signal “over a regular telephone line” or have the capacity to transcribe text or images “onto paper,” it does not meet the statute’s definition of a “telephone facsimile machine.”[[173]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn173)\\n\\nLooking ahead, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in a case that addresses whether the Hobbs Act, which limits the judicial review of FCC final orders to appellate courts, requires a federal district court to accept the FCC’s interpretations of the TCPA.[[174]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn174) Because the FCC’s interpretations can affect how courts evaluate claims and defenses in TCPA actions, this decision could have a significant impact on how these cases are litigated and resolved.\\n\\n> **E. State Law Litigation**\\n\\n> > **1. California Consumer Privacy Act Litigation**\\n\\nThe CCPA provides a limited private right of action, allowing consumers, individually and as a class, to pursue civil litigation when their personal information falls subject to “unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business’s violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices.”[[175]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn175) The CCPA provides for the greater of either statutory damages—between $100 and $750 per consumer per incident—or actual damages, plus injunctive or declaratory relief, and any other relief a court deems appropriate.[[176]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn176) In practice, this private right of action is used almost exclusively to address data breaches. While there was not significant movement in 2024 on these issues, some courts have issued rulings supporting an expansive interpretation of what constitutes a “data breach” subject to the private right of action. Moreover, in 2024, several courts focused on the threshold consideration of whether defendants qualified as a “business” subject to the CCPA, as well as defenses to the CCPA. The details of these rulings are summarized below.\\n\\n> > > **a. Limited Reach of the CCPA’s Private Right of Action**\\n\\nIn several suits over the past year, courts did not reach the merits of alleged violations of the CCPA because they first assessed whether a defendant was subject to the private right of action. Courts generally interpreted the statute to require that the defendant qualify as a “business”—an entity that collected or otherwise made determinations about how to process plaintiffs’ personal data—to be subject to the statute’s private right of action, though they differed on whether a traditional service provider could be sufficiently subject to those requirements.[[177]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn177) For example, in a putative class action against a debt collection and accounts receivable management company, the court dismissed the CCPA claim, holding that though plaintiffs did plead that the company “obtained” and “received” the plaintiffs’ PII, the complaint did not allege that the defendant “determined how and why [plaintiffs’] PII should be processed.”[[178]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn178) In another suit, the court held that a cloud-based software company did not qualify as a “business” because enabling the secure transfer of files by hosting them on the company’s file-sharing software did not amount to “determin[ing] why and how consumers’ PII was processed.”[[179]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn179) However, in a suit against a health information technology company, the court held that the defendant’s use of plaintiffs’ PII “to develop, improve, and test” the defendant’s services—a common type of processing by “service providers”—was sufficient to make it subject to the CCPA.[[180]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn180)\\n\\nAnother court addressed the scope of a data breach, effectively doubling down on prior courts’ broadening of the common understanding of the triggering event required for the private right of action. In that case, plaintiffs brought a putative class action against a mental healthcare company that was alleged to have been disclosing users’ mental health information to a third party without providing notice to users.[[181]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn181) The company moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ CCPA claim, arguing that CCPA’s private right of action applies only to traditional data breaches.[[182]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn182) The court disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss the claim, holding that courts have allowed CCPA claims to “survive a motion to dismiss where a plaintiff alleges that defendants disclosed plaintiff’s personal information without his consent due to the business’s failure to maintain reasonable security practices.”[[183]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn183)\\n\\n> > > **b. Other CCPA Defenses**\\n\\nIn 2024, defendants continued to invoke CCPA defenses, such as narrow exemptions and the statute’s notice requirement, with varying success.\\n\\n**_International Law Firm_**. After an international law firm discovered a significant cybersecurity breach of its systems, plaintiffs brought a putative class action lawsuit against the firm asserting multiple claims, including violations of the CCPA.[[184]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn184) The firm argued in part in its motion to dismiss that because the named plaintiff was employed by one of the defendant’s clients, the “business-to-business” exception applied because the defendant received his data as part of a business-to-business transaction.[[185]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn185) Though this exemption expired on January 1, 2023, it was in place at the time of the 2021 data breach, so the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim with prejudice.[[186]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn186) Though defendants can no longer rely on this exemption for data breaches taking place in 2023 and beyond, this case serves as a reminder that it remains a viable defense to breaches occurring before that time.\\n\\n**_Hotel and Casino Entity_**. A hotel and casino entity was subject to a data breach in November 2022, in which the PII of thousands of customers was accessed by hackers.[[187]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn187) A class action suit was brought against the entity asserting multiple claims, including violations of the CCPA.[[188]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn188) The entity contended plaintiffs’ claim for statutory damages under the CCPA was barred because notice of the CCPA claim was untimely.[[189]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn189) One of the named plaintiffs had filed his individual complaint—which did not assert a CCPA claim—and mailed a CCPA pre-suit notice on the same day.[[190]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn190) Several months later, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint which included a statutory damages CCPA claim.[[191]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn191) The court held that the plaintiffs had satisfied the notice requirement because the defendant was provided with the required cure period before the plaintiff brought the claim to court.[[192]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn192) The court further held that the allegations in plaintiff’s letter were sufficient to provide statutory notice and that the defendant’s measures taken after receipt of the letter did not cure the unauthorized release of the plaintiffs’ data and were instead designed to address future threats.[[193]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn193)\\n\\n> > **2. State Biometric Information Litigation**\\n\\n> > > **a. Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)**\\n\\n2024 was another active year for Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). There were both plaintiff- and defense-friendly developments, as well as a novel, significant settlement. Of note for plaintiff-friendly developments, courts permitted a complaint against a cloud service provider to survive a motion to dismiss, and concluded that plaintiffs located outside Illinois may be able to bring BIPA claims against defendants who allegedly process their data within Illinois. The year also saw some of the most important pro-defendant developments in recent years, which collectively limit the scope of BIPA to a considerable extent. Most notably, the Ninth Circuit held that biometric data must be capable of identifying the plaintiff to be subject to BIPA, and the Illinois state legislature amended BIPA to greatly reduce the likelihood that a plaintiff may recover an astronomical damages award. In addition, district courts recognized limitations on BIPA, including that the statute doesn’t apply when the defendant doesn’t control the data at issue, and that a plaintiff has to plead specific facts in order to rely on a theory that her biometric data was included in an AI model’s training dataset.\\n\\n> > > > **i. Application of BIPA to Cloud Services Companies**\\n\\nIn a putative class action against a cloud service provider in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, a plaintiff alleged that the cloud service provider violated BIPA by allowing a third-party video game publisher to use its cloud computing services to facilitate the use of biometric data.[[194]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn194) Specifically, the complaint alleged that a feature offered by the video game publisher, which allowed users to upload facial images that the game publisher then used to create a customized player resembling the user, involved the creation of a scan of face geometry (a biometric identifier under BIPA) and that the provider received the plaintiff’s scan from the video game publishers, transmitted it to third-party gaming platforms, and stored it on its servers. A magistrate judge recommended that the provider’s motion to dismiss be denied. The court reasoned that, despite the provider’s assertion that it “had no ability to access users’ biometric data and [was] unaware of [its] receipt of such information,” the court must take as true the allegation that the provider “knowingly obtained” the data and that it remained in the provider’s “control” as the provider “disseminate[d] and store[d] it” on its servers.[[195]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn195) Thus, the court concluded that the plaintiff had plausibly alleged both the provider’s “possession” and “collection” of biometric data, even absent any allegation that the provider itself had “extracted Plaintiff’s face geometry.”[[196]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn196) The district court ultimately adopted the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation,[[197]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn197) and shortly thereafter, the parties reported that they had reached a settlement.[[198]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn198) The outcome of this case may signal an increased risk faced by service providers based on conduct undertaken by their clients.\\n\\n> > > > **ii. In-State Processing of Non-Illinois Residents’ Data**\\n\\nCustomers of a sandwich chain filed a putative class action against the company, alleging that it violated BIPA by recording its drive-through customers’ voice interactions and, using technology located at its corporate headquarters in Illinois, extracting from each recording a unique voiceprint.[[199]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn199) The company moved to dismiss, arguing in part that BIPA shouldn’t be applied extraterritorially to two of the named plaintiffs, who visited the company’s drive-throughs in Indiana and Tennessee rather than Illinois. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, reasoning that the two named plaintiffs who never used a drive-through in Illinois had nonetheless “alleged that the extraction, collection, analysis, and use of their voiceprints all occurred at Defendant’s headquarters in Illinois” and that such allegations provided a sufficient nexus to Illinois.[[200]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn200) However, the court was careful to qualify that “discovery may reveal that the connection to Illinois is sufficiently tenuous as to warrant revisiting the matter at the summary judgment stage.”[[201]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn201) The decision could lead other plaintiffs located outside the borders of the State of Illinois to bring BIPA claims under a theory that the defendant processed their biometric data within the state. It remains to be seen, however, whether other courts will be receptive to such a theory.\\n\\n> > > > **iii. Biometric Data Must Be “Capable of Identifying” the Plaintiff**\\n\\nIn a notable case before the Ninth Circuit this year, a non-user of a social media platform who appeared in user-uploaded photos that the platform processed with facial-recognition technology in an effort to identify consenting users in connection with a feature that helped users tag their photos argued for a sweeping interpretation of BIPA: that the social media company needed to obtain consent to the use of facial recognition from every anonymous non-user who appeared in a photo uploaded by a user.[[202]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn202) The plaintiff’s reading effectively would have outlawed facial-recognition technologies like defendant’s, as well as many popular biometric identification technologies, such as most biometric security systems.\\n\\nIn the first appellate ruling of its kind, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment for the defendant on the ground that BIPA applies only to data that can be used to identify the plaintiff, and therefore does not apply to the anonymous data that the company created from photos of non-users for the purpose of determining whether they were users of the service who had consented to identification. The decision effectively overruled earlier rulings from courts within the Ninth Circuit, which had held that data is covered by BIPA so long as it meets the plain meaning of a “scan of face geometry”—a type of “biometric identifier” under the statute.[[203]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn203) The ruling is potentially a watershed development. By its terms, the ruling significantly cabins the reach of BIPA, curtailing the ability of individuals anonymous to the defendant (such as non-users of a product or service) to bring suit under the statute.\\n\\nDistrict courts have since applied this ruling to the same effect. One court in the Northern District of Illinois dismissed a BIPA claim against a consumer electronics company.[[204]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn204) The plaintiff had alleged that the company collected data subject to BIPA when its technology analyzed photos on users’ phones and tablets to create “unique . . . digital face templates” for each person’s face, which it used to recognize the same face in multiple photos and group together photos of that same face.[[205]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn205) Relying on the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, the court explained that the plaintiffs failed to allege that the company had created data “capable of identifying a person’s identity.”[[206]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn206) Although the technology “group[ed] unidentified faces together,” it was the device’s users who had the option to “add names to the face[]” groupings.[[207]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn207)\\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit’s ruling is a significant, defense-friendly development, and its precise contours will continue to be developed through litigation at the district court level.\\n\\n> > > > **iv. BIPA Damages Amendment**\\n\\nIn a sweeping decision, the Illinois Supreme Court held in 2023 that a BIPA violation accrues _each time_ a private entity collects or discloses biometric data without prior informed consent, not just upon the first collection or disclosure.[[208]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn208) The court acknowledged the defendant’s concerns that this broad reading of the statute could lead to “annihilative liability” but determined that “policy-based concerns about potentially excessive damage awards under [BIPA] are best addressed by the legislature.”[[209]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn209) The court concluded its decision with a “respectful[] suggest[ion] that the legislature review these policy concerns and make clear its intent regarding the assessment of damages under the Act.”[[210]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn210)\\n\\nIn 2024, the legislature heeded the Illinois Supreme Court’s call and amended BIPA to address companies’ concerns about astronomical damages awards.[[211]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn211) As amended, BIPA now clarifies that a plaintiff can recover from a defendant only once under section 15(b) for violations involving the collection of “the same biometric identifier or biometric information from the same person using the same method of collection” and once under Section 15(d) for violations involving the disclosure of “the same biometric identifier or biometric information from the same person to the same recipient” where such data was collected “using the same method of collection.”[[212]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn212) The amendment greatly reduces the likelihood that an individual plaintiff can recover an outsized damages award under the statute. However, courts are currently split on the question of whether the amendment applies retroactively.[[213]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn213)\\n\\n> > > > **v. Defendant’s Lack of Control of the Data at Issue**\\n\\nA plaintiff brought a putative class action against a software company under sections 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA, alleging that the company “acquired [her facial scan] when third parties viewed her photograph with a device running the [] operating system owned and controlled by [the defendant].”[[214]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn214) Notably, the plaintiff did “not allege that her biometrics were physically stored on [the defendant’s] hardware.”[[215]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn215)\\n\\nThe Northern District of Illinois granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the company “possess[ed]” or “collect[ed]” the alleged facial scans simply because it (1) “designed, licensed, and updated the facial scan software on users’ devices”; (2) “exercised control over the device users’ ability to access and use the facial scan software”; and (3) “retained the ability to control whether and how a user could use the facial scan software.”[[216]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn216) As the court explained, “control of the facial scan software is not the same as control of the facial scan data that is collected using the software” onto users’ own devices.[[217]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn217) In other words, offering “a tool that can be used to collect a facial scan is not the same as actually doing the collecting.”[[218]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn218)\\n\\nThe court’s decision is notable. It paves the way for defendants to seek dismissal of BIPA claims when it is clear from the face of the complaint that the alleged data at issue remains on physical devices or other hardware controlled by third parties and the defendant does not itself exercise any control over the data.\\n\\n> > > > **vi. Pleading Requirement for AI Model-Training Theory**\\n\\nA plaintiff brought suit under BIPA against the developer of a mobile app that generates avatars from photos that users upload.[[219]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn219) The plaintiff had never used the defendant’s app or personally uploaded his photos to it. Rather, his theory was that the defendant violated section 15(b) by training the AI model that powered the app on a publicly available dataset of five billion photos that allegedly included images of him.\\n\\nWithout reaching the merits of the plaintiff’s claims, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing. The court accepted the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff failed to provide a sufficient basis to conclude that his photos were even included in the dataset at issue. The plaintiff simply speculated that they might be, since the dataset was purportedly assembled by scraping popular social media sites that he uses.\\n\\nThe court’s decision confirms that a plaintiff must allege facts that make it at least plausible that his photos are at issue when predicating a lawsuit on an AI model-training theory.\\n\\n> > > > **vii. Other Noteworthy Developments**\\n\\nIn a multidistrict litigation, a group of plaintiffs brought a consolidated class action complaint against a facial recognition company, alleging (among other things) that the company “covertly scraped over three billion photographs of facial images from the internet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each individual depicted to harvest the individuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.”[[220]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn220) The district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims, concluding that the statute applies to “biometric data extracted from photographs.”[[221]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn221)\\n\\nThen, this year, the court granted preliminary approval of a global settlement of the litigation.[[222]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn222) The proposed settlement is noteworthy for its novel terms: it would provide the class members a 23% stake in the company. At then-current potential valuations, the class members’ stake was estimated to be worth roughly [$52 million](https://tinyurl.com/3ra8p8zd). Counsel for the plaintiffs issued a statement that the defendant lacked the funds needed to pay a large settlement, so the parties worked instead to find “a creative solution.”[[223]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn223) The settlement is yet to receive final approval.\\n\\n> > > **b. Texas Biometric Privacy Law Litigation**\\n\\nIn the first-ever lawsuit filed by the Texas Attorney General under Texas’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI), Texas claimed a large social media company violated the statute by allegedly collecting biometric data without adequate consent from photos and videos that users uploaded to the platform as part of a suite of now-deprecated features relying on facial recognition technology.[[224]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn224) The case had been set to go to trial in June 2024, but the parties ultimately settled, with the defendant agreeing to pay $1.4 billion without admitting liability.\\n\\n> > > **c. New York Biometric Privacy Law Litigation**\\n\\nBeyond BIPA and CUBI, there were also noteworthy decisions involving New York City’s Biometric Identifier Information Law this year.[[225]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn225) A pair of decisions, one from the Southern District of New York and the other from the Western District of Washington, held that the prohibition on “profiting” from biometric data in New York City’s law is limited to transactions involving the data itself and does not extend to other benefits that the defendant may derive from the use of that data.\\n\\nFirst, earlier this year, a plaintiff filed a complaint against a major live-entertainment company, alleging that the company violated New York City’s law by using facial recognition software to identify and exclude from its venues attorneys employed by law firms that are involved in litigation against it.[[226]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn226) The law applies where a defendant “profit[s] from the transaction of biometric identifier information,” so the “question presented,” the court explained, was whether the “defendant profits when it shares biometric data with a third-party vendor to facilitate” the attorneys’ exclusion.[[227]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn227) The court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss. It concluded that the complaint failed to allege that the defendant profited from the transaction itself, as the statute requires.[[228]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn228) Rather, the complaint asserted that the defendant “profits when it _purchases_ a product or service,” a theory of liability that “defies common sense.”[[229]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn229)\\n\\nSecond, a group of plaintiffs filed a putative class action against two retailers, alleging that their technologies that enable customers to simply walk out of their stores with their chosen products without queuing up at the checkout line violate New York City’s law.[[230]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn230) The complaint alleged that one of the defendants profited from the plaintiffs’ biometric data by “sharing, leasing, trading or selling its . . . devices and databases by . . . allow[ing] [the defendant] to link individuals’ biometric information to other valuable forms of information[,] . . . allowing [the defendant] (or other third parties willing to pay [the defendant] for such packaged data) to make more targeted advertising, marketing, pricing, and promotional decisions.”[[231]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn231) The court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Citing the decision involving the live-entertainment company, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ argument regarding the statute’s profit element, concluding that “the profit Plaintiffs allege appears to ‘flow from [the defendant’s] employment of [a] broader program, albeit one advanced by biometric data sharing’”—an “unpersuasive” theory.[[232]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn232) The court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the other defendant as well, reasoning that they “fail to allege sufficient facts that [the defendant] plays any part in the control of the . . . technology or otherwise share in biometric identifier information as defined” under the statute.[[233]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn233)\\n\\n> **F. Other Noteworthy Litigation**\\n\\n**_Daniel’s Law Ruled Constitutional_**. In 2024, a federal judge rejected a constitutional challenge to Daniel’s Law, a New Jersey privacy statute enacted in 2020 in response to the tragic murder of the son of a federal judge. The statute allows law enforcement officials and their immediate family members (Covered Persons) to request that any person, business, or association not disclose their home address or unpublished telephone numbers.[[234]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn234) In 2023, amendments to the statute permitted Covered Persons to assign a Daniel’s Law claim to a third party, and provided for actual damages (set at a minimum of $1,000 as liquidated damages) for each violation, punitive damages upon a showing of willful or reckless disregard of the law, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs—triggering a surge of litigation against a wide range of businesses that interact with New Jersey residents.[[235]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn235) In a suit involving a third-party assignee, defendants moved to dismiss the claims on the basis that Daniel’s Law is unconstitutional on its face on the basis that it violated the First Amendment and that it is a strict liability statute.[[236]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn236) In November 2024, the District Court of New Jersey denied the motion to dismiss and held that Daniel’s Law is constitutional.[[237]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn237) As a threshold matter, the court held that Daniel’s Law is a privacy statute, so its content-based regulation of speech was not subject to strict scrutiny.[[238]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn238) Instead, the court applied the three-factor test that the Supreme Court has used for balancing the right of privacy against the right of free speech and concluded that Daniel’s Law passed this test.[[239]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn239) The defendants also argued that the law was unconstitutional on its face as a strict liability statute, that it provides for actual or liquidated damages for non-compliance without regard to fault.[[240]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn240) The court rejected this argument as well, concluding that “Daniel’s Law must be read as imposing liability only if a defendant unreasonably disclosed or made available the home addresses and unlisted telephone numbers of covered persons after the statutory deadline had expired.”[[241]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn241) Due to the exposure created by the statutory penalty of actual damages or $1,000 per violation and the short response window, this ruling has significant implications for any business interacting with New Jersey residents, and businesses should implement policies and procedures for complying with take-down requests in the 10-day window. Shortly after the ruling, the court issued an order permitting the defendants to appeal,[[242]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn242) so we will continue to monitor this case in 2025.\\n\\n**_Cellular Data as Property_**. In the first appellate decision addressing whether cellular data is property, the Ninth Circuit held that cellular data can be categorized as property that is subject to conversion.[[243]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn243) Plaintiffs in a class action suit sued a major technology company alleging the company performed passive data transfers using plaintiffs’ cellular data without their knowledge or consent, asserting a claim for conversion under California law.[[244]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn244) The court held in connection with a motion to dismiss that cellular data can constitute property for purposes of a conversion claim—which requires a showing that there is a property right at issue—because even though the data is intangible, it allows access to a cellular network, can be limited by a user’s data plan, is capable of exclusive possession or control, and can be valued, bought and sold.[[245]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn245) The court also held that the plaintiffs plausibly alleged the company used their data in a way that was inconsistent with their own property interests.[[246]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn246) The court observed that when the company transfers information from its own servers, the data spent during that transfer is allocated to the customer, and accordingly is treated by the wireless carrier as if it is data that the customers themselves used.[[247]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn247) Therefore, the company’s use of plaintiffs’ cellular data to transfer the information prevented plaintiffs from using all the cellular data they purchased and was inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ property interests.[[248]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn248)\\n\\n**_Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) Litigation_**. Courts continued to determine the scope of the VPPA in 2024. One notable case focused on a narrow liability exception under VPPA and the level of scrutiny that should apply to VPPA. The Massachusetts District Court denied a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against a broadcasting company where plaintiffs alleged the company disclosed their PII and viewing history to third parties without their consent.[[249]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn249) The company argued that their actions fell within the narrow exception for disclosures made “incident to the ordinary course of business,” but the court held that the alleged “marketing, advertising, and analytics” uses of the data did not fall within the exception’s permissible uses.[[250]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn250) The court also held that the alleged disclosures of consumers’ PII constituted commercial speech for First Amendment purposes and required application of intermediate scrutiny to VPPA, which it passed.[[251]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn251)\\n\\nAnother federal district court also dismissed a class action suit against a casino and entertainment company that owns and operates a website that offers online video games that users can access by registering for an account with their personal information.[[252]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn252) The company installed a tracking tool on its website that the plaintiff alleged shares information about a users’ gaming history with a third party.[[253]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn253) The court held the VPPA was inapplicable because the company did not qualify as a video tape service provider under the statute.[[254]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn254) The court reasoned that video games do not constitute prerecorded content that is subject to the VPPA _unless_ the video game is interlaced with “cut scenes” that are similar to prerecorded video clips.[[255]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn255)\\n\\nA California state court, meanwhile, denied class certification in a case asserting claims for invasion of privacy and for violations of the federal Wiretap Act, CIPA, and related common law claims arising from Meta’s offering of “Business Tools” to HBO and its alleged tracking of users’ video-viewing activities.[[256]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn256) The court denied class certification because there was no classwide method to prove whether any particular video was viewed by a class member or by someone using their account: “an individualized inquiry is necessary to determine whether the data . . . reflects a particular class or subclass member’s own video-viewing behavior rather than the video-viewing behavior of a friend or family member who has accessed that individual’s HBO account.”[[257]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn257)\\n\\nA Georgia federal court, however, granted class certification in a VPPA case based on a similar theory as the California case above.[[258]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn258) Plaintiff alleged that WebMD violated the VPPA, because by installing the “Facebook Pixel” on webmd.com, WebMD allegedly disclosed the video-viewing activity of its users to Facebook without their consent.[[259]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn259) In granting Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, the court rejected WebMD’s argument that an individualized inquiry would be required, noting that scenarios a user might have allowed someone else to use their computer or a video was not working at the time when the user clicked on the link were the “exceptions,” not the rule.[[260]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn260) Specifically, the court wrote, “WebMD does not point to any instances in which its concerns became a reality nor does it point to any evidence regarding these concerns being anything more than exceedingly rare potential exceptions . . . the idea that class certification should be denied merely due to a possibility at this stage that a website gave a 404 error or a family member used someone else’s computer seems absurd.”[[261]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn261)\\n\\n**_State Video Privacy Statutes_**. The Ninth Circuit upheld district court dismissals of two class action suits against two major technology companies that alleged each company violated two state privacy statutes by unlawfully retaining users’ PII: The New York Video Consumer Privacy Act and the Minnesota Video Privacy Law.[[262]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn262) Plaintiffs alleged that both state privacy statutes provide a private right of action for the unlawful retention of personal information, but the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that neither of the privacy statutes had such a private right of action.[[263]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftn263)\\n\\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\\n\\nIn 2024, the privacy and cybersecurity landscape in the U.S. continued to be defined by an expansion of state comprehensive privacy laws, and regulatory and enforcement activity led by federal and state agencies, as well as civil litigation brought by private plaintiffs. This was driven in large part by the rapid development and advances in data-intensive technologies like generative AI, the unrelenting cyber threat posed by malicious actors and foreign adversaries, and an increasing focus on protecting biometric data and children’s online privacy. We expect these trends to continue in 2025 as existing data-intensive technologies and use cases take hold and new ones emerge. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation, we expect federal and state agencies to continue to lead the charge on the regulatory front and continue to aggressively pursue enforcement actions against companies and individuals. However, given the shift at the federal level driven by the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation, pro-innovation, and reversal of Biden-era policies around content moderation, AI, and digital assets, we expect a significant alteration in policy and enforcement priorities at the state and federal levels. We will continue to track and analyze these developments in the year ahead.\\n\\n[[1]](https://www.gibsondunn.com/us-cybersecurity-and-data-privacy-review-and-outlook-2025/#_ftnref1) Del.

Throughout 2024, global [privacy](https://www.opensecurity.es/las-medidas-esenciales-para-blindar-la-informacion-en-2025/) experienced a critical period marked by new regulations, significant court rulings, and an increase in cyberattacks. These dynamics have shaped an increasingly complex privacy landscape that will continue to be decisive in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\nOn the occasion of Data Privacy Week (January 27 to 31) and International Data Protection Day (January 28), ESET, a leader in [cybersecurity](https://revistacloud.com/glosario/que-son-soluciones-ciberseguridad/)Cybersecurity solutions are essential in the digital era…, emphasizes the importance of protecting personal and corporate data in an ever-evolving digital environment.\\n\\n“Data, both personal and corporate, has become one of the most valuable assets for users and companies. Cybercriminals have been aware of this for a long time, which is why they are constantly launching malicious campaigns to try to access and steal it,” explains Josep Albors, Director of Research and Awareness at ESET Spain. “Data Privacy Week reminds us that protecting this information is not only a legal obligation but also an essential necessity to ensure trust and security in the digital environment,” he adds.\\n\\nKey Lessons from 2024: Regulations, Sanctions, and Technological Trends\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs ESET reminds us, **the year 2024 brought forth regulatory and judicial decisions that have redefined global privacy**. The fines imposed on major companies such as [LinkedIn](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/irish-data-protection-commission-fines-linkedin-ireland-eu310-million), [Uber](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2024/dutch-sa-imposes-fine-290-million-euro-uber-because-transfers-drivers-data-us_en), and [Meta](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/DPC-announces-91-million-fine-of-Meta) for GDPR violations highlighted the need for rigorous compliance and proper protective measures. At the same time, rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) generated new legal interpretations, such as the expansion of the definition of sensitive data and the establishment of stricter criteria for processing information under legitimate interests.\\n\\n“_We cannot forget_ that _the adoption of regulations like the EU AI Act also underscored the growing concern about privacy and security risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence. These events highlighted that privacy is not just a technical issue but also a legal and strategic priority that requires continuous attention from organizations_,” comments **Albors**.\\n\\nPreparing for the Challenges of 2025\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nAs the regulatory framework evolves, organizations will face a more challenging landscape in 2025. Stricter enforcement of regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act and new requirements from the EU AI Act will demand a proactive approach from security and compliance teams. At the same time, technological advancements are driving the proliferation of more sophisticated threats, with artificial intelligence tools being used to enhance cybercrime attacks. These trends also pose ethical and legal dilemmas, as the massive use of data in AI systems may conflict with users’ privacy rights.\\n\\nIn this context, indirect risks also emerge. According to ESET, cybercriminals could exploit fears of regulatory sanctions to extort companies, while a lack of preparedness could attract scrutiny from regulators. “_All of this emphasizes the importance of taking preventive measures and strengthening security strategies_,” warns **Josep Albors**.\\n\\nRecommendations for Users and Companies\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nTo navigate this complex landscape, ESET recommends:\\n\\n*   **Stay informed**: Understand applicable regulations and their implications.\\n*   **Adopt good security practices**: Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and apply encryption to sensitive data.\\n*   **Invest in technological solutions**: Implement tools like ESET Internet Security for consumers and ESET PROTECT Advanced for businesses, which provide comprehensive protection against cyber threats.\\n*   **Promote education**: Raise awareness and train employees and users on the importance of protecting information.\\n*   **Update devices and software**: Always keep operating systems and applications up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Monitor compliance**: Stay aware of regulatory changes and conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) before introducing new products or services.\\n*   **Strengthen data security**: Review existing protocols, identify responsible parties, and establish clear reporting and management systems.\\n*   **Avoid public Wi-Fi networks**: These networks are easy targets for cybercriminals.

This includes implementing [sophisticated](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/cloud-compliance-tools/) access controls, auditing systems, and automated compliance checks that function across multi-cloud environments.\\n\\nEnhanced privacy features are becoming integral to cloud services, with technologies such as zero-trust architectures, end-to-end encryption, and differential privacy gaining traction.\\n\\nData sovereignty concerns, particularly the location and legal jurisdiction of data storage, are prompting cloud providers to invest in localized data centers and adopt policies that give customers more control over their data.\\n\\n**Trend 5: Blockchain and Cloud-Native Technologies – Advancing Data Centralization and Security Measures:** The integration of blockchain technology and cloud-native environments is poised to transform data centralization and security measures in cloud computing in 2025.\\n\\nBlockchain’s decentralized nature inherently enhances data security by enabling transparent, tamper-evident records, making unauthorized data manipulation nearly impossible.\\n\\nMoreover, [blockchain](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/next-gen-infosec/enhance-cloud-data-security/) facilitates a high level of data integrity and authentication, ensuring that data remains accurate, consistent, and accessible only to authorized parties. This integration addresses one of the primary concerns of cloud consumers: the potential risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.\\n\\nIn the realm of data centralization, blockchain supports secure, reliable inter-cloud data exchanges and enables decentralized data management while maintaining transparency and security.\\n\\nThis is vital for fostering collaboration across different cloud platforms without sacrificing the control and ownership of data. By intertwining bloc chain with cloud-native technologies, organizations can create a robust, secure foundation for storing, processing, and sharing data, ultimately leading to improved operational efficiencies and greater trust among users and partners.\\n\\n[TAKE OUR DATA MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION PREP COURSES](https://training.dataversity.net/learning-paths/dmbok-and-cdmp-preparation-learning-plan?utm_source=dataversity&utm_medium=inline_ad&utm_campaign=DMBOK_LP_temp2&utm_content=copy1)\\n\\n[![Image 5](https://www.dataversity.net/wp-content/themes/dataversity/inc/images/dv-logo.png)](http://dataversity.net/)\\n\\n[DATAVERSITY.net](http://dataversity.net/)\\n\\n[TDAN.com](http://tdan.com/)\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Twitter_white.png)](http://twitter.com/dataversity) [![Image 7](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Linkedin_white.png)](http://linkedin.com/company/dataversity) [![Image 8](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Youtube_white.png)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeTLK-PN9ZynubJ5UIxzk-Q) [![Image 9](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Flipboard_white.png)](http://flipboard.com/@dataversity) [![Image 10](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/Facebook_white.png)](https://www.facebook.com/Dataversity)\\n\\nConferences\\n-----------\\n\\n*   [Enterprise Data World](http://enterprisedataworld.com/?utm_source=DV%20Footer&utm_medium=Link)\\n*   [Data Governance & Information Quality](http://dgiqconference.com/)\\n\\nOnline Conferences\\n------------------\\n\\n*   [Enterprise Data Governance Online](http://datagovernanceonline.com/?utm_source=DV%20Footer&utm_medium=Link%20)\\n*   [Data Architecture Online](http://dataarchitectureonline.com/?utm_source=DV%20Footer&utm_medium=Link%20)\\n\\nDATAVERSITY Resources\\n---------------------\\n\\n*   [DATAVERSITY Training Center](https://training.dataversity.net/)\\n*   [Women in Data Management and Governance](https://www.dataversity.net/category/education/women-in-data-management-and-governance/)\\n*   [White Papers](http://whitepapers.dataversity.net/)\\n*   [Product Demos](https://www.dataversity.net/category/education/webinars/ondemand-webinars/product-demos/)\\n*   [What is…?](https://www.dataversity.net/category/education/what-is/)\\n*   [Data Puppets](https://www.dataversity.net/data-puppets/)\\n\\nCompany Information\\n-------------------\\n\\n*   [Why Train with DATAVERSITY](https://content.dataversity.net/rs/656-WMW-918/images/DATAVERSITYEducation.pdf)\\n*   [About Us](http://dataversity.net/about-dataversity-net/)\\n*   [Content Sponsorship](https://www.dataversity.net/sponsors/)\\n*   [Contact Us](https://www.dataversity.net/contact-us)\\n*   [Press Room](https://www.dataversity.net/category/education/press-room/)\\n\\nNewsletters\\n-----------\\n\\n*   [DATAVERSITY Weekly](https://dataversity.net/subscribe)\\n*   [Women in Data Management and Governance Monthly Newsletter](https://content.dataversity.net/WDMGNewsletter.html)\\n*   [TDAN Bimonthly Newsletter](https://content.dataversity.net/TDAN-Subscribe_Subscribe-to-TDAN.html)\\n*   [DATAVERSITY Email Preferences](https://content.dataversity.net/Subscription-Management-with-DVBlue.html?utm_source=DV&utm_medium=Footer)\\n\\nDATAVERSITY Education\\n---------------------\\n\\n*   [Data Conferences](https://www.dataversity.net/category/data-conferences/)\\n*   [Trade Journal](https://www.dataversity.net/)\\n*   [Online Training](http://training.dataversity.net/)\\n*   [Upcoming Live Webinars](https://www.dataversity.net/category/education/webinars/upcoming-webinars/)\\n\\n*   [![Image 11](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.44.26-PM.png)](http://dgiqconference.com/)\\n*   [![Image 12](https://dv-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-26-at-2.44.16-PM.png)](http://enterprisedataworld.com/)\\n\\n© 2011 – 2025 Dataversity Digital LLC | All Rights Reserved.

For one, the portability of cloud data allows it to travel across various locations very fast. With each region having different data regulations, it gets hard to keep up.\\n\\nIn some cases, organizations using the cloud must meet data residency regulations. For instance, the rules may require them to only use cloud service providers with data centers in specific locations. [...] Common challenges include security issues due to the increased attack surface from being hosted online, to multi-environment complexities like integrating multiple different cloud solutions or on-premises architecture with the cloud. In niche industries, expertise shortages often present a significant problem, where there’s simply not enough experts to go around.\\n\\nThe following factors highlight some of the most pressing challenges of cloud computing:\",\n",

Typically, cloud service providers offer tutorials and courses for their services.\\n\\n**Facts & Expert Analysis About Cloud Computing Challenges:**\\n\\n*   **Between cost management, data security and privacy:** A 2024 study revealed security and cost management as the top two cloud computing challenges.[1](https://www.cloudwards.net/challenges-of-cloud-computing/#Sources) In a 2023 study, 64% of respondents cited security and compliance as the main challenge while 60% mentioned cost management.[2](https://www.cloudwards.net/challenges-of-cloud-computing/#Sources)\\n*   **Continuous adoption:** Even with the potential challenges, cloud adoption isn’t slowing down, and a 2024 study backs continuous cloud adoption.[1](https://www.cloudwards.net/challenges-of-cloud-computing/#Sources)\\n*   **Go multi-cloud:** Although a multi-cloud approach comes with some complexities, a 2023 study confirmed that most high-maturity enterprises are adopting multi-cloud solutions.[3](https://www.cloudwards.net/challenges-of-cloud-computing/#Sources)\\n\\nWhile cloud computing has transformed data access and management, cloud computing is not without challenges. The challenges of cloud computing are diverse, but often come down to fundamental aspects of the cloud.\\n\\nCommon challenges include security issues due to the increased attack surface from being hosted online, to multi-environment complexities like integrating multiple different cloud solutions or on-premises architecture with the cloud. In niche industries, expertise shortages often present a significant problem, where there’s simply not enough experts to go around.\\n\\nThe following factors highlight some of the most pressing challenges of cloud computing:\\n\\n*   **Data security and privacy** — Moving data to the cloud raises the potential for data leaks, data losses and security breaches.\\n*   **Complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments** — Integrating solutions across multiple cloud platforms can be complex.\\n*   **Performance challenges** — Maintaining consistent performance can get tricky in some situations. For one, sudden traffic surges can lead to downtime.\\n*   **Interoperability and flexibility** — Each cloud service provider has proprietary software, which can make applications hard to operate on other platforms. Also, the level of customization is largely up to the provider, so there’s some inflexibility.\\n*   **High dependence on networks** — Cloud systems rely heavily on network connectivity for data flow. Of course, this dependence comes with various risks, ranging from performance to security risks.\\n*   **Lack of knowledge and expertise** — Cloud computing services are numerous, so every new tool might require training or the recruitment of an expert.\\n*   **Reliability and availability** — Cloud systems must consistently perform and have zero or near-zero outages. However, with software bugs and hardware issues always lurking, achieving this reliability and availability isn’t easy.\\n*   **Password security** — Some cloud systems require the creation of multiple accounts to use different services. Multiple accounts mean more passwords to manage. What’s more, cloud platforms — particularly SaaS and cloud storage providers — are top targets for hackers.\\n*   **Cost management** — While relatively cost-effective, the cost of cloud computing typically varies with usage, which can be unpredictable. Proper cost management is therefore essential.\\n*   **Suboptimal resource usage** — Having access to computing resources on-demand raises the chances of paying for underused resources.\\n*   **Control or governance** — Cloud users relinquish significant control to cloud service providers. That means they must establish a thorough framework to maintain responsible standards.\\n*   **Compliance** — It’s essential to ensure that the cloud provider’s policies adhere to regulatory guidelines.\\n*   **Migration** — Making the shift from traditional systems to the cloud (or between different clouds) without breaking anything can be tricky.\\n*   **Private cloud** **creation** — Creating a private cloud offers an extra layer of security and data privacy. However, this comes with some infrastructural complexity and requires a higher level of expertise.\\n*   **Segmented usage and adoption** — Cloud service providers often struggle to create services that satisfy all potential use cases. Because of this, some companies may have to adopt services piece by piece.\\n\\nShow all\\n\\nMeet the experts\\n\\n![Image 99: Adeyomola Kazeem](https://www.cloudwards.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Adeyomola-150x150.jpg)\\n\\n**Adeyomola Kazeem** (Writer)\\n\\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adeyomola-kazeem)\\n\\nAdeyomola Kazeem is an experienced writer and cloud computing professional with over five years of writing experience, specializing in cloud computing, Linux and DevOps.

Data Security and Privacy\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nSince cloud solutions are accessible from anywhere, keeping data both secure and private is one of the key challenges of cloud computing.\\n\\nWhile cloud service providers secure the underlying infrastructure, customers remain largely responsible for data security and privacy in the cloud. Ordinarily, traditional privacy and security policies should suffice. However, customers have less control of data in the cloud, so their security approaches differ, resulting in a need for alternate data security and privacy policies.\\n\\nApart from that, cloud environments are a public target for malicious actors, so they experience regular attacks. **Going by attack frequency only**, cloud environments have an increased attack surface. Potential data breaches by insiders on the provider side further increase the attack surface.\\n\\nData regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation may also be a concern as they require adherence to stringent laws.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Encrypting data at rest and in transit reduces the chances of data breaches by malicious actors. \\n*   Having fine-grained access control lowers the risks of insider threats.\\n*   Performing regular security audits to continuously enhance data security and privacy policies will ensure sustained effectiveness.\\n\\n2\\\\. Complex Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nHybrid and Multi-Cloud environments allow users to take advantage of the strengths’ of multiple platforms, but they’re also much more complex to manage.\\n\\nOne of the main cloud computing challenges in multi-cloud environments is the lack of standardization among cloud providers. This makes app integration across cloud platforms somewhat difficult.\\n\\nEnsuring appropriate configuration in each multi-cloud environment is another concern. The more complex the environment, the trickier the configuration management. Similarly, managing the billings, tools and so on for each platform could get too complicated.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Building applications and systems with cloud-agnostic tools makes for easy integration across platforms. \\n*   Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization and container orchestration tools make configuration management easier and more consistent. \\n*   Investing in cloud cost management tools like nOps and Densify will help you manage costs in multi-cloud environments.\\n\\n3\\\\. Performance Challenges\\n--------------------------\\n\\nWhile flexible and reliable, the cloud has its performance challenges, most commonly in the form of latency. Latency can come from a slow internet connection. It could also be due to physical distance from the cloud data servers. In either case, latency slows down data transfer and ruins the end user’s experience.\\n\\nChanges in usage patterns can also affect cloud performance. For one, when accessing shared cloud resources, cloud users may experience reduced performance during peak usage periods. Similarly, applications can become inaccessible to end users during unexpected traffic surges. With reputable cloud platforms, this period of inaccessibility typically doesn’t last too long.\\n\\nAnother source of cloud performance challenges is flawed architecture. Poor choice of services — such as improper virtual machine sizing or configuration — could cause your software to underperform.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Switching to more reliable ISPs, choosing closer data centers and using content delivery networks (CDNs) can help mitigate latency. \\n*   Integrate auto-scaling into your cloud infrastructure to greatly reduce the downtime caused by surges. \\n*   Configure auto-scaling with fitting parameters as your usage pattern changes.\\n*   Work with the cloud service provider to optimize architecture (e.g. AWS Enterprise Support).\\n*   Invest in routine training to enhance innovation and promote resource optimization.\\n\\n4\\\\. Interoperability and Flexibility\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud solutions should ideally be as interoperable and flexible as possible, meaning they can function independent of their specific platform or vendor.\\n\\nHowever, cloud service providers build some of their services on proprietary software. Because of this, integrating apps using these services across multiple platforms sometimes isn’t straightforward. This can ultimately lead to vendor lock-in, where the user is so dependent on a particular cloud provider that they can’t leave.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Use open-source or cloud-agnostic tools when possible to prevent vendor lock-in and enhance interoperability.\\n*   Standardize cloud software across your organization to enhance flexibility.\\n\\n5\\\\. High Dependence on Networks\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nHigh dependence on networks is one of the biggest challenges of cloud computing, and it’s one that is hard to avoid, since networking is one of the core components of cloud computing.\\n\\nData transfer to and from the cloud is done over a network, which is typically the internet. With limited bandwidth or slow internet, the data transfer time will skyrocket and performance will drop. Even worse, without internet access, it’s almost impossible to use the cloud. Data transfer over the internet also adds an extra layer of exposure, raising the risk of data breaches.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Use offline services when possible to minimize the high dependence on networks.\\n*   Invest in high-bandwidth internet and thorough disaster recovery to mitigate the worst of the issues. \\n*   Use private networks for in-house services.\\n\\n6\\\\. Lack of Knowledge and Expertise\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nA lack of knowledge or expertise in cloud computing is a common problem for organizations moving from an on-premises solution to the cloud.\\n\\nBusinesses will face hurdles when switching to the cloud if their team isn’t comfortable with cloud technology solutions. If the business lacks professionals with cloud training, they will certainly face operational challenges. For instance, getting a tech team that isn’t cloud-savvy to implement an effective cloud security policy would be a big ask.\\n\\nApart from that, teams that don’t have sufficient cloud expertise are more likely to use resources inefficiently. Of course, this will lead to unnecessary costs. Furthermore, a team or individual with insufficient cloud expertise won’t be able to keep up with the most recent cloud trends and developments, stagnating the business and stripping it of its competitive edge.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Invest in thorough training to raise expertise in cloud technologies.\\n*   Take advantage of available resources to learn cloud computing. Many cloud service providers also provide structured courses and training for their own products.\\n\\n7\\\\. Reliability and Availability\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nReliability and availability, meaning how rarely a computing solution becomes unavailable for whatever reason, are commonly cited as upsides of cloud computing.\\n\\nHowever, while it would be ideal to have completely reliable and available systems, actually achieving this is nearly impossible, and reliability or availability challenges are often inevitable in any system.\\n\\nCloud providers still sweat over the availability of their infrastructure. In many cases, reliability and availability issues stem from external factors like security breaches and unstable internet connectivity. However, there could also be software bugs, physical infrastructure failure or misconfiguration of the cloud resources.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Negotiate a desirable service-level agreement with the cloud service provider to ensure a high level of availability. \\n*   Implement resilient disaster recovery plans.\\n*   Train IT teams to reduce human errors that may stem from misconfiguration.\\n*   Routinely update software to catch bugs before they become a big deal.\\n\\n8\\\\. Password Security\\n---------------------\\n\\nWith everything accessible over the internet, keeping passwords secure is one of the most important parts of cloud security as a whole.\\n\\nCloud users sometimes have to create several accounts to use multiple services. This creates a situation where they must remember many different passwords, which can be difficult. Some people try to avoid this by reusing passwords, but this presents a potential [security vulnerability](https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-computing-vulnerabilities/).\\n\\nUsers who have one password for a cloud account are also somewhat vulnerable. For them, password exposure would mean that attackers can gain access to all their data and applications in the cloud.\\n\\nWhile the issue may seem minor, not many users follow best password practices. This creates even more vulnerabilities.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Adhere to strong password creation policies.\\n*   Use multi-factor authentication. \\n*   Use password managers to keep track of different passwords.\\n*   Create least-privileged users with fine-grained permissions to reduce the chances of attackers gaining access to all your data and apps through one password.\\n\\n9\\\\. Cost Management\\n-------------------\\n\\nManaging costs for cloud computing can be tricky, especially in the early stages, when usage can be unpredictable. As a result, you may overprovision or underprovision the cloud resources. You’ll lose money if you overprovision, but you may face performance issues if you underprovision.\\n\\nIn cloud computing, customers cede some architectural visibility to the provider. However, this reduced visibility also means that customers won’t readily get an overview of all the resources they use. Ultimately, they’ll accrue hidden or unrecognized charges.\\n\\nSome services have complex pricing models, which make budgeting difficult. Situations like these are even worse when they involve multi-cloud services.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Use cloud cost management tools to help simplify cost management. Many cloud service providers have cost management tools that are native to their platform, but there are third-party tools that can work across the board. \\n*   Build or train a FinOps team to continuously monitor and optimize cloud spending.\\n\\n10\\\\. Suboptimal Resource Usage\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBecause cloud computing offers easy access to computing resources, it can be easy to waste these resources or use them inefficiently, with users provisioning resources they don’t need on a whim. Consequently, they’ll have underutilized resources, wasting energy and raking in unnecessary costs.\\n\\nOverused resources are also potential cloud challenges. When resources are provisioned to the max or the scaling configuration is skewed, resources will be spread too thin and performance will plunge. Besides performance drops, overused resources can be prone to security attacks. For example, a virtual machine overloaded with privileges becomes a hotbed for attackers.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Monitor resources and configure auto-scaling correctly to prevent resources from being provisioned to the max. \\n*   Run workloads on serverless services where possible.\\n\\n11\\\\. Control or Governance\\n--------------------------\\n\\nIn the cloud, you relinquish some control and governance to the provider. As a result, you can’t enforce configurations to your desired degree. In other words, you may just have to accept some of the provider’s default configurations.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Establish a thorough cloud governance framework, one that covers everything related to the cloud in your organization. \\n*   Integrate cloud-agnostic monitoring and management tools in your infrastructure to get a centralized view of all resources.\\n\\n12\\\\. Compliance\\n---------------\\n\\nStaying compliant with various regulations and laws while operating in the cloud comes with many hurdles. For one, the portability of cloud data allows it to travel across various locations very fast. With each region having different data regulations, it gets hard to keep up.\\n\\nIn some cases, organizations using the cloud must meet data residency regulations. For instance, the rules may require them to only use cloud service providers with data centers in specific locations.\\n\\nWithin an organization, different teams can have different perspectives on compliance in the cloud. This can create confusion, hindering overall compliance. Furthermore, tracking compliance across each platform can be difficult when running multi-cloud services, particularly with these changing regulations.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Use automated compliance-check tools to ease the burden of monitoring compliance across multiple platforms. \\n*   Plan carefully and thoroughly to reduce confusion between teams.\\n\\n13\\\\. Migration\\n--------------\\n\\n[Cloud migration](https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-migration) — the process of migrating data or workflows between architectures — requires extensive planning and a well-defined strategy to increase the chances of success. The planning and strategizing becomes even more daunting for complex systems that aren’t readily adaptable to the cloud.\\n\\nMigration to the cloud comes with downtime and service disruption. Proper planning could minimize the downtime, but there will always be some disruption.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Upskill your team in preparation for cloud migration to enable a smooth transition. \\n*   Carefully develop a migration strategy, and plan for all possibilities and contingencies.\\n\\n14\\\\. Private Cloud Creation\\n---------------------------\\n\\n[Private clouds](https://www.cloudwards.net/private-cloud/) are cloud solutions dedicate to a single entity or organization. While it’s beneficial for security and privacy, creating a private cloud comes with extra costs. It also introduces an extra layer of complexity into cloud architecture, requiring a higher level of expertise.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Assess the cost-benefit ratio of creating a private cloud before you make the decision. \\n*   Upskill your team to help them stay familiar with the complexity of private cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n15\\\\. Segmented Usage and Adoption\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nWhen setting up cloud infrastructure, different teams may opt for varying services across different cloud providers. If this segmented adoption isn’t well managed, they’ll end up with some inconsistencies.\\n\\nApart from that, integrating services from various cloud providers can be difficult due to the incompatible differences in the underlying structure of said services.\\n\\nSolutions:\\n\\n*   Plan the integration for the multi-cloud environment, taking note of the differences between the platforms and how they affect the overall integration. \\n*   Standardizing cloud services may also be an effective solution.\\n\\nWhat Are the Challenges of Cloud Computing in Healthcare?\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe [cloud computing](https://www.cloudwards.net/cloud-computing) challenges in healthcare include data sensitivity, vendor lock-in, high dependence on connectivity, and migration concerns.\\n\\n*   **Data sensitivity:** Protecting sensitive data is a legal requirement for healthcare institutions as health data often contains personally identifiable information. Thus, data privacy and security for cloud computing in healthcare is often more thorough. Healthcare compliance regulations are also more detailed, giving cloud service providers more hurdles to scale.\\n*   **Vendor lock-in:** When using a specific cloud provider, it’s easy to get “locked in” to their service, meaning it becomes impossible to migrate away from it in the future. Considering their data privacy and security needs along with their compliance concerns, healthcare providers may have limited options when choosing a cloud provider. As such, they may become locked-in when they finally find a platform that satisfies their requirements.\\n*   **High dependence on connectivity:** Cloud solutions require a high level of connectivity to function. The critical nature of healthcare data means that they must always be available in real time. However, with the cloud’s high dependence on connectivity, network outages are a constant threat.\\n*   **Migration concerns:** Migrating workflows and data from a legacy system to the cloud can be fraught with danger. Most healthcare providers rely on legacy systems, which aren’t readily compatible with modern cloud systems. This introduces some difficulties when migrating to the cloud.\\n\\nWhat Are the Challenges of Cloud Computing in Education?\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCost considerations, integration concerns, data privacy and security, and lack of expertise are some of the primary challenges of cloud computing in education.\\n\\n*   **Cost considerations:** Managing expenses is key for most education institutions. Of course, cloud computing will save schools money in the long term. However, the up-front costs of migration can be an issue for institutions with tight budgets.\\n*   **Integration concerns:** Integrating on-premises systems with the cloud can present challenges. Some educational institutions have legacy infrastructure, which cannot readily integrate with the cloud. Cloud integration may therefore require more effort than it would with modern systems.\\n*   **Data privacy and security:** Data privacy and security remain a concern in any sector that uses cloud computing. Educational institutions hold sensitive student data, and migrating such data to the cloud increases the attack surface. Strict security and privacy protocols that align with applicable regulations must be enforced to protect the data.\\n*   **Lack of expertise:** A lack of expertise and training on cloud technologies is a common problem in cloud computing, and in education depends on the teachers’ ability to use the cloud solutions. Therefore, cloud migration in education typically requires training the educators, which introduces extra costs.\\n\\nWhat Are the Challenges of Cloud Computing in the Banking Industry?\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSecurity is the number one challenge of cloud computing in the banking industry. Besides that, there are also compliance concerns, integration challenges, and control and governance issues. These challenges are described below:\\n\\n*   **Security:** Banks handle sensitive financial data, so they are prime targets for cyberattacks. Since transitioning to cloud computing potentially increases the attack surface, stricter policies are often required to prevent data breaches and financial losses.\\n*   **Compliance concerns:** The banking sector is heavily regulated for obvious reasons. When switching to cloud computing, banks must carefully assess cloud service providers and choose those that meet all their compliance requirements.\\n*   **Integration challenges:** Banks often have complex infrastructure with legacy technology. As such, their systems may not readily integrate with modern cloud infrastructure. This would pose a problem and cause some delays during cloud migration.\\n*   **Control and governance:** Traditionally, banks have full control over their computing infrastructure. However, they cede some control when they switch to the cloud, demanding a need for thorough cloud governance policies.\\n\\nWhat Are the Two Most Common Cloud Adoption Challenges?\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe two most common cloud adoption challenges are security and cost management. Switching to cloud computing exposes data and apps to more interfaces, raising the risk of breaches and leaks. Organizations therefore have more work to do in the way of security.\\n\\nWhile cloud computing pricing might be economical, cost management can be an issue. Organizations lose some visibility when they use cloud infrastructure, making it harder to keep track of and manage all the resources in use.\\n\\nWhat Are the Disadvantages of Cloud Computing?\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe [disadvantages of cloud computing](https://www.cloudwards.net/disadvantages-of-cloud-computing/) include increased cyberattack surface, limited control, cost management and network dependence. Cloud data interacts with more interfaces, so a breach is more likely.\\n\\nAlso, cloud users have limited control over resources, and may struggle to monitor and manage costs. Finally, cloud computing depends on network connectivity, which comes with downtime risks.\\n\\n### What Are the Security Risks of Cloud Computing?\\n\\nThe security risks of cloud computing include insider threats, account hijacking, data breaches, DoS attacks, insecure APIs and limited visibility.\\n\\nIn traditional systems, insider threats came from the organization only. However, in cloud computing, insider threats exist in both the cloud service provider and the organization. These insiders can exploit flaws in the system, even with robust security measures in place. You can mitigate this with least-privilege access management.\\n\\nIn many instances, if cyberattackers compromise the credentials of a cloud account, they gain access to virtually all resources and sensitive data. With least-privilege access, multi-factor authentication, strong password policies and cybersecurity awareness, you can avoid this.\\n\\nBecause data on the cloud interacts with more interfaces, more APIs, more humans and so on, there’s an increased chance of a data breach, whether intentional or not. Thorough encryption policies and least-privilege access make this less likely.\\n\\nAPIs drive most of the movement in cloud computing. Thus, if they’re insecure, hackers can have a field day when they exploit vulnerabilities. Organizations can avoid this by understanding the security posture of APIs before using them.\\n\\nFurthermore, cloud computing’s dependence on network connectivity exposes applications to DoS attacks. DoS attacks make applications inaccessible to real users. However, cloud providers typically have firewalls and other measures in place to prevent them.\\n\\nCloud computing abstracts some processes from the users, limiting their visibility. As such, organizations just have to trust that their cloud providers are following through with standards. Choosing reputable cloud service providers is essential here.\\n\\n### What Are the Benefits of Cloud Computing?\\n\\nThe [benefits of cloud computing](https://www.cloudwards.net/benefits-of-cloud-computing) include cost-effectiveness, on-demand service access, scalability and elasticity, enhanced collaboration and reduced infrastructural burden.\\n\\nCloud computing is cost-effective because it takes away the up-front costs of setting up on-premises infrastructure. In addition, the pricing model typically focuses on usage, meaning you only pay for what you use. This makes it more cost-effective than traditional infrastructure.\\n\\nOn-demand service access means that cloud computing offers computing resources on-demand. There’s no lead time; the resources are available when you need them. Since resources are available on-demand, the cloud is elastic, meaning you can readily scale up or down.\\n\\nCloud computing also makes it possible for teams to collaborate from any location with network access. Distance and location are no longer barriers to teamwork. Organizations don’t have to worry about maintaining physical infrastructure; they just need experts to handle their applications and data in the cloud.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n--------------\\n\\nMost cloud computing challenges point back to security concerns. However, this doesn’t mean that cloud computing is inherently insecure. It’s just that data and applications interact with more interfaces, increasing their attack surface. Cost management is also a big challenge as it’s easy to lose sight of resources when infrastructure gets complex.\\n\\nIn your daily usage of cloud computing, what challenges are most frequent? How do you overcome these challenges? What future improvements are you most excited for in the cloud computing industry? Leave a comment about your experience with cloud computing in general.

Introduction**\\n\\nCloud computing features the shared pool resources that are accessed whenever needed over the internet, and it has made data management and processing more accessible for organisations [1].Â It is relatively fast, fueled by the breakthroughs in computing that have, in turn, brought about a rapid rise in the amount of data available.Â Conversely, the fullness of information brings specific problems, including storage, processing, and security. Cloud computing services have a solution to these problems by providing affordable and scalable environments for data storage processing, and no expensive infrastructure maintenance operations are required [1] .Â Although very useful, adopting the cloud can give rise to complex compliance and regulatory concerns. These necessitate a framework that would facilitate data protection, privacy, and security. The importance of compliance and regulatory frameworks in cloud computing cannot be stressed enough [2].Â With cloud services for storing and processing sensitive data by organisations becoming the energy, safeguarding data breaches, privacy violations, and non-compliance penalties becomes very important [2].Â The art of complying with the rules and regulations constitutes a huge problem for organisations, particularly those operating in highly regulated sectors such as health care, finance, and government [2].Â Similarly, technological advancement is usually faster than adopting the laws and regulations, so enforcement becomes even more challenging [3]. The article extensively examines compliance and regulatory issues in cloud computing, cutting across the healthcare, finance, government, education, and retail sectors.Â The sectoral analysis will discuss the peculiarities and strategies for dealing with these organisations based on the information from more recent literature and regulatory frameworks.Â Additionally, it analyses real-life cases and imminent issues to provide useful guidance on risk-avoidance procedures and promote secure and compliant cloud environments with best practices.\\n\\n**Healthcare Sector**\\n\\n*2.1 HIPAA Compliance in Cloud Computing*\\n\\nHealth Informsation Systems (HIS) can significantly improve intelligence, dependability, and availability by using Cloud computing services.Â Adopting cloud computing in HIS introduces three critical dimensions: financial reports and cost, IT operational excellence and DevOps, and security, privacy, and compliance [4].Â Each dimension's surfacing issues and drivers for consideration calls for a complete assessment to inform effective decision-making by healthcare executives [4].Â Yet, the delicacy of healthcare data in HIS mandates implementing comprehensive safety measures that would discourage the risks associated with cyber threats [5].Â The application of cloud computing platforms in the medical field introduces novel security complexities, where patients' data is exposed to cybercriminal activities.Â Henceforth, improving cloud security will be necessary to protect patient information and achieve regulatory compliance.\\n\\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations create enormous hurdles for healthcare organisations using cloud-based services.Â HIPAA rules are presented in a lengthy textual format that must be manually implemented into health IT systems. It often creates complexity, leading to implementation issues and potential non-compliance [6].Â A knowledge graph that is semantically rich and built through Semantic Web technologies provides a solution that automates HIPAA policies, enabling automatic reasoning and integration with existing health systems [6].Â The approach saves compliance efforts and secures adherence to HIPAA regulations. Ultimately, Health IT systems' security and integrity of patient data in the cloud are affected positively.\\n\\n*2.2 Data Security Concerns in Healthcare Cloud Services*\\n\\nHealthcare 4.0 implementation by the way of cloud computing comes with security and privacy problems mainly addressing the issue of patient data protection.Â In this aspect, data can be shared by different parties engaged in healthcare using fog computing, IoT, and telehealthcare technologies that may use cloud storage so that efficiency and accessibility can be improved [7]. Â However, incorporating clouds as an additional method increases the risk to malicious actors.Â It can be a violation of patients' privacy and result in bizarre consequences like identity theft.Â One of them is addressing risk through strict security coupled with privacy within the cloud environment, where the health records are stored.\\n\\nThe emergence of IoT and cloud computing in e-health systems requires improving information security to protect people's sensitive medical data. Through the Internet of Things (IoT), hospitals' devices and sensors are rapidly throwing data streams that can now be saved or transmitted via clouds.Â For this reason, the information should be encrypted with other measures, such as secure protocols, because hackers may intercept the data [8].Â While there is a need to include these two communication models between different points to speed up data circulation and power saving, it also creates new vulnerabilities that threaten the production of the services that provide continuity [9].Â Therefore, developing a comprehensive preventive mechanism against cyber-attacks is essential to protect all parts of the hospital from any intrusion into their system.\\n\\n*Case Studies: Healthcare Industry Compliance Challenges*\\n\\nThe healthcare sector encounters numerous compliance issues involving data protection and confidentiality.Â Blockchain technology faces these challenges and provides decentralised, transparent, and permanent data management solutions [10].Â Nevertheless, blockchain implementation in health data management systems is limited by technical and regulatory hurdles, namely scalability, interoperability, and compliance with the existing healthcare regulations [10].Â Nevertheless, despite these issues, numerous projects and case studies show that blockchain technology is practically applicable and can help improve data transparency, traceability, and security in healthcare [10].Â However, ongoing research and development will be required to surmount present obstacles and successfully deploy blockchain technology in healthcare data management on a large scale.\\n\\nAdditionally, healthcare digitalisation enhancement extends cybersecurity risks. Therefore, robust security measures and policy frameworks should be implemented to protect patient data.Â Cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches and ransomware attacks represent a significant threat to hospitals and healthcare organizations, which could result in financial loss and reputational damage [11]. Efforts to upgrade ICT infrastructure, formulate data governance policies, and preserve cybersecurity preparedness of the healthcare industry have not been as successful as the other sectors.Â The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the credibility of cybersecurity in the healthcare domain, highlighting the need for preventive measures to protect patient data and meet the integrity of healthcare systems [12].Â Thus, the integrated approach incorporating technological development, regulatory conformity, and organisational resilience should be the focus of any efforts to overcome emerging compliance challenges in the healthcare industry.\\n\\nThe compliance issues are significant for the healthcare stakeholders which should consider FCA risks, the new No Surprises Act, telehealth practices post COVID-19 public health emergency, HIPAA changes after Dobbs. These FCA cases, which are instigated by whistleblower incentives, endanger people even when there was no malicious intent from the latter. The No Surprises Act requires detailed good faith billing and presents compliance challenges, especially for uninsured patients. Although telehealth has been extended, there is fearful legal supervision that has to meet appropriate patient-physician interaction. Therefore, new elements introduced by HIPAA also provide quicker access to the patientâs record which exacerbate enforcement and privacy concerns along with new rules regarding reproductive health care information post-Dobbs decision added more layers to them. These facts call for high compliance standards and specialization that is needed when combating such issues in the health care sector.\\n\\n**Financial Sector**\\n\\n*3.1 Compliance with Financial Regulations.*\\n\\nFinancial organizations must follow certain laws such as (PCI DSS) payment card industry data security standards, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in finance because data protection and consumer trust are the second most significant factors. Financial systems should protect transactions and customer information, and mobile payments in finance are an emerging trend [13]. Nevertheless, many users are finding it difficult to comply with this multi-layered rule system that requires continuous human efforts to monitor user and provider compliance [13]. Professionals have established a framework based on automated knowledge representation systems, including knowledge graphs, so compliance processes can be simplified even more for mobile wallet transactions [14]. These frameworks help meet strict regulatory requirements by using semantic technologies and machine-readable formats that foster good data security systems while enhancing compliance with financial services regulations.\\n\\nThe cost implications of data protection laws of privacy have been very high, posing a great problem for financial service providers. However, adhering to continuous monitoring concerning the dynamic nature of cybersecurity threats, banks are trying to reduce compliance costs by automating processes and still having sufficient security measures in place [15].Â Researchers employed qualitative research methods, including the Delphi technique, to develop a model that will be used in the management of IT under the privacy laws that govern cyber security [15].Â Centralised frameworks and an adequate number of IT personnel professionals trained in many aspects of this field, including detection systems, are vital to overcoming this compliance challenge [15].Â Consequently, with the adoption of sound information governance practices and relevant technical solutions, institutions can effectively counter the high costs associated with the conformance of various privacy laws that keep changing in an environment with high risks to data security.\\n\\n*3.2 Data Protection and Privacy in Financial Cloud Services*\\n\\n![](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6InZraWF2ODBsLzYxNzE3MjUxNTg5MTg0LmpwZWciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfX19)\\n\\n**Fig 1: Adopting an effective approach to cloud data protection [44].**\\n\\nFig. 1 demonstrates an efficient method of cloud data protection using several security layers, including encryption, access controls, monitoring, and backup. These layers contribute to the secure cloud environment through data protection and confidentiality.\\n\\nFinTech and cloud computing are key technologies in the current financial systems.Â Conversely, they provide benefits, and they can get rid of security and privacy beyond repair.Â Cloud-based FinTech applications can enable numerous types of financial services or operations apart from that. They also have risks like security issues, cyber-attacks, and data privacy challenges [16].Â They designed and conducted surveys to investigate current safety problems and detection methods of fintech safety and privacy in the solution context [16].Â Furthermore, the complicated security administration makes the system risky due to the companies' vast use of virtualized layers and data center hubs [17].\\n\\nAs a result, the new era that emerged with blockchain technology underlines that there is both a chance and a challenge for the financial sector's development.Â It implies that although the technology might ensure transparency, security, and efficiency, some key downsides associated with its implementation are also considered ethical issues [18].Â Experts discovered via qualitative research that the commonest problems for this innovation, such as hidden knowledge in blockchains, which might slow adoption rates, are very real [18].Â However, recommendations have been provided for such barriers to be tackled, coupled with the success factors being prioritized. Knowledge sharing is needed and should be structured using an organized management approach [18].Â The bank's role in incorporating blockchain into its system has to be very strategic dealing with the key problem of data protection while strictly adhering to all data protection regulations. It ensures that the full potential of such technology within the financial sector is realized without compromising individual privacy rights.\\n\\n*3.3 Case Studies: Financial Industry Compliance Challenges*\\n\\nThe banking sector has either succeeded or failed in adopting the latest technologies, such as RPA and blockchain.Â On the contrary, the fact that the technology has brought compliance challenges is also an issue.Â As an illustration, Deutsche Bank incorporated RPA systems that can be shown through adverse media screening, improving efficiency and accuracy [19].Â In India, the bank sector is one of the areas where blockchain technology has a lot of benefits, including enhancing data security and streamlining the transaction processes [20].Â However, issues with norms and law, especially when systems of different blockchain networks across borders are concerned, may arise.\\n\\nBesides, the digital transformation projects launched in South Korea and overseas indicated that advanced online and digital technologies should be fully utilised. Equally, the culture of collaboration and innovation within enterprises should be developed [21].Â These projects focus on improving customer experience and organisational efficiency and participating in developing public and social structures [21].Â Thus, digital transformation must be approached through a combination of human-oriented tools and productivity-seeking objectives, emphasising the importance of strategic alignment and the correct use of organizational capabilities [21].Â Altogether, these studies bring to light the complexities and opportunities that emanate from compliance issues in the financial industry due to technological advancements and digital transformation exercises.\\n\\nIn addition to traditional financial laws like the PCI DSS and GLBA, the financial sector has several emerging concerns arising from the progression of technology, especially in areas like fintech. An example is a multinational bank that intends to use the blockchain technology in cross border transactions. Despite the prospects of enhancing efficiency and cutting costs, this innovation poses challenges for adherence to data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations across states. These and other blockchain disruptions combined with the mandatory compliance with existing financial regulations define the challenging reality of modern regulatory compliance for the financial institutions. This case requires preparatory regulatory adjustments that also entail improved collaboration between participants in the industry and the regulators in order to deal with the changing compliance environment.\\n\\n**Government Sector**\\n\\n*4.1 Compliance with Government Regulations*\\n\\nUsing cloud computing in the public sector increases privacy risks because government data is susceptible to the public.Â As the debate on cyber security in the cloud has progressed seriously, privacy protections have been left in the dark to some extent. There is a shortage of complete guidelines or frameworks designed to support privacy in cloud environments [22].Â The lack highlights the importance of developing privacy protection criteria in cloud computing toward proper data protection and consideration of privacy requirements.Â Additionally, an increasing utilization of cloud computing in power systems by institutions like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) brings the importance of secure and reliable cloud implementation to the forefront [23].Â The formation of tasks for jobs and handouts to help power industry people meet the standards on regulations and resource cloud technology to satisfy the business requirements is evidence of the struggles[50].\\n\\nThe governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) apparatus is essential for managing regulatory compliance in government organizations. Yet, implementing GRC systems is not without challenges, primarily for organizations that are not mature or bankrupt.Â The film stresses a thorough realization of GRC parameters and issues, including its adaptability to diverse sectors and organizations with different dimensions [24].Â Evaluating the effectiveness and cost efficiency of GRC frameworks is necessary for organizations to sustain and maintain GRC frameworks in the public sector.Â These research developments stress the point of compliance challenges' resolution and implementation of more stringent frameworks to ensure regulations' compliance and data security in governmental operations.\\n\\n*4.2 Sovereignty and Data Localization Issues in Government Cloud Services*\\n\\nData sovereignty issues have been political factors that have given rise to careful analysis of cloud services, notably data preference and jurisdiction matters.Â Governments worldwide and Australia are facing issues associated with the safety of the data held by foreign cloud providers and governments [25].Â  As such, it is necessary to form digital sovereignty policies, especially those protecting the government's cyber security systems and data.Â The group is convinced that governments have all the required space within the existing trade agreements and procurement frameworks to take essential measures both to protect governmental data and ensure legitimate processes.Â On the one hand, safeguarding data sovereignty becomes even more difficult considering the extraterritorial nature of laws such as the CLOUD Act from the USA and the envisioned e-evidence regulation from the EU [26].Â These regulations create foreign law enforcement procedures regarding cloud-stored government data.Â Fig 2. below specifies the data localization checklist, which encompasses some critical requirements such as legal ones, data residency, access controls, encryption, audit trails, and data classification, crucial for the required security during data handling.\\n\\n![](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6ImpiZGJiaTlqLzYxNzE3MjUxNTg5MTg2LnBuZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6ODAwLCJmaXQiOiJpbnNpZGUiLCJ3aXRob3V0RW5sYXJnZW1lbnQiOnRydWV9fX0=)\\n\\n**Fig 2: Government Agencies are Improving their Data Collection Processes [47]**\\n\\nThe government's data independence framework for cloud services is a complicated fabrication from global law and judicial difficulties.Â This can be achieved by implementing different tools that allow the host government to limit the activities of multinational service providers that are not domiciled in their countries.Â The methods involve executive agreements in assessment and legal barriers toward cloud service providers that cannot store public sector information on particular CSPs [26].Â While a balance between the states' power and enforcement agencies' functionality is extremely challenging, such a balance is crucial.Â The right mix can be obtained when jurisdictional frameworks of a nation and region are harmonised with global compacts and bolstered with technical safeguards to permit a state to retain its sovereignty while ensuring data safety concurrently.\\n\\nData sovereignty is a concept that asserts that data is regulated and subjected to the laws of the country of the owner, which has become even more important in the context of globalization. It includes localization, the establishment, and safeguarding of data with a focus on processing it in domestic jurisdictions. Complexity of data sovereignty in todayâs context includes regulatory policies like CCPA in the United States, GDPR by European Union which influences the businesses in USA based companies operating in Europe. China with its Cybersecurity law and Latin American countries like Brazil with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) are examples of different regions that have unique requirements for data sovereignty hence explaining why there are different approaches to data management and protection across the world.\\n\\nIt is for such reasons that an appreciation of data sovereignty in all its dimensions is imperative, especially for the multinational corporations that encounter a myriad of challenges such as localization, hosting, protection and compliance with the existing laws. This means that for example setting some companies to operate under strict conditions of not transferring their data outside the national borders is detrimental since it increases cost to them. Moreover, having regional laws that require organizations to organize their physical storage facilities according to geography also contributes to this problem. Adherence to local regulations on data protection is essential so as not to face legal repercussions and to retain the trust of consumers. Consequently, multinational corporations are faced with various laws on national regulation of information, coupled with the need for the corporate to also do things legally without necessarily incurring so much operationally, which makes it one of the most significant issues in todayâs global business environment.\\n\\n*Case Studies: Government Sector Compliance Challenges*\\n\\nA challenge for governments in cloud computing is the rise of information safety and data confidentiality.Â Using the survey on the application of cloud technology in the local government in Australia, the researchers found that even though the technology has security, the security issue hinders the adoption of the technology at the regional level [27].Â The research revealed that operational security, adherence, and consciousness were amongst the top threats; therefore, a dual security approach to the cloud is required.Â It has to be technical and process-centered.Â The government should propose a theory of security requirements whereby there will be common security standards for cloud services adoption.Â It fosters risk compliance reduction and builds robust data privacy protection within the government sector.\\n\\nThe research also shows that institution-based measures impact how public sector organizations introduce cloud computing in Oman.Â In the given study, the coercive institutions and original imitation forces were found to play a major role during the adoption process.Â It also suggested taking contextual nuances in mind while undertaking the development of these interventions.Â The \\\"Smart intervention\\\" method highlights the complex socio-technical environment surrounding cloud adoption [28]. As a result, it can be said that institutional strategies are aimed at being rethought and differentiated.Â The complexity of those cases increases exponentially as up-to-date, technical, and institutional solutions are required.\\n\\nCurrently, governments experience several governance and regulation issues when entering the environment of the development of rapidly progressing technologies. The fast rate of growth and advancement in technology has required a swift and synchronized set of policies for efficiency, adaptability, and safety of the common good. Moreover, this pandemic has led to a need for governments to reconsider their regulatory policies in an effort to encourage innovation ad tackle the risks associated with it. However, there are still more issues like the issue of terminology and definitions that even make the way forward towards more effective regulatory measures more of a challenge. The same issues can also be used by governments to realise that in order to redesign markets and foster growth of the economy, they have to utilise transformational shifts. Thus, the main issue is how to develop an effective governance and regulation framework which will be innovative, but at the same time, escape the risk of ineffective control of rules and create an actively developing inclusive market environment.\\n\\n**Education Sector**\\n\\nEducation sector homogenization has a very big impact.Â Implementing cloud-based education systems has made it harder due to the incorporation of rules and regulations such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).Â These programs store and manage the personal information of students, which may lead to problems with data security and privacy.Â Colleges must ensure that their sites match the FERPA standards to prevent unrestricted access or breaches of information storage in clouds [29].Â The cloud should be given strong security measures while its educational records are stored.\\n\\nIn addition, the challenge of data ownership and accessibility from cloud services is an extra issue for compliance with education [29].Â  Cloud computing offers easy accessibility but can still raise concerns about ownership and permission.Â Digital divide, cost control, and interoperation make it more difficult for the education sector to develop an easy-to-comply policy [31]. Hence, closing the gap requires opportunities to be equitable so that digital disparity can be dealt with while the expenses essential to learning should become affordable.Â Furthermore, when narrowing down to service providers with the relevant solutions, it will be very important to investigate interoperability issues and understand what solutions will work better for different institutions.Â Schools should wipe all these obstacles to have their systems accomplished, in this way giving students a secure knowledge environment.\\n\\nThe case studies cover the adoption of cloud computing in educational institutions, which involves different factors, each with unique functions [30]Â After technical readiness proves it is time to proceed, organizational support and socio-cultural factors will be considered when deciding whether to adopt.Â There are theories like the TechnologyâOrganizationâEnvironment (TOE) Framework, which can shed light on how new technologies are deployed in the different organizations and the concepts of compliance issues [30].Â Combining all these elements with varying frameworks in using cloud technologies in the teaching and learning process at different education levels will result in improved and effective usage.\\n\\nWithin education, there are severe compliance risks related to regulations, data protection and data security in learning institutions. The need for compliance is underscored in case studies across various industries and sectors. For instance, a recent article in Human Resources Today pointed out that an onsite WFM system had certain issues which include poor governance as well as incomplete databases, all of which are vital explanations why compliance ought to be observed to the tee at all times. Equally, in the case of Verified First against Angels Care Home Health, it demonstrates how much it is essential to retain recruiting processes in compliance with the laws of providing quality care in the confined premises.\\n\\nAnother significant aspect that is critical for proper compliance training, which is highlighted by PlatCoreâs case study of Corporate Compliance Training Programs dynamic learning on aspects that can enhance the employee performance and can avoid infringement of legislation. Analyzing the ClearCompany case in the Employer of Record specification one might come across the necessity to follow the local legislation to avoid legal issues. These examples in conjunction with other similar works such as Paycorâs ACA and overtime tracking analyses demonstrate that these regulations are intricate and require proper tracking systems and specialists on compliance. These cases, therefore, cohesively demonstrate how holistic compliance initiatives serve a useful function in promoting regulatory compliance, and sustaining the fabric of education sector organizations.\\n\\n**Retail Sector**\\n\\nSensitive cardholder data must be protected by all businesses in the retail sector, which involves obtaining a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) certification. Therefore, PCI DSS compliance faces challenges when adopting cloud computing, specifically in AWS.Â Some of the services and attributes of AWS enable an organization to construct and deploy an environment with PCI DSS regulations likewise [33].Â Following good practices is a way to guarantee compliance. These can, for example, include incident response protocols, access controls, and conducting regular vulnerability assessments [33]. Retailers can circumvent issues related to meeting the PCI DSS requirements within the fluctuating cloud environment by implementing systems with technology focused on ensuring AWS compliance and recommended practices.\\n\\nThere is a problem with customer data protection due to AI usage and the integration of cloud computing into e-commerce.Â Authorize issues emerge whenever people's privacy is invaded through data collection, algorithmic decisioning and surveillance [32].Â Besides cloud computing, other worries concern privacy breaches, ownership ambiguities, and international compliance, among other issues [32].Â The privacy of the individual's information becomes more exposed if the companies that adopted the cloud services did not implement adequate security measures.Â Effective strategies will need to be developed that focus on minimizing risks and safeguarding customer data to bolster trust between businesses and clients.\\n\\nMoreover, new retail models, such as online-to-offline (O2O) trade, have been launched.Â Here, it is important to note that O2O brings together both online and offline platforms where digital technology is utilized to enhance the experience of the customers as well as the efficiency of the business operation [34].Â Nevertheless, traditional retailers face problems when trying to implement digital innovations into their business processes or even when seeking to integrate new technologies properly [34].Â For instance, small and medium-sized jewelry enterprises (SMEs) have to constantly digitize and innovate their businesses to remain competitive in such an environment [34].Â Among other strategies, including digital technologies, retailers should simplify their business processes to adapt more flexibly to changing environments. In turn, it will help them achieve growth within the retail sector.\\n\\nA storeâs operation in the fields of training and policy management entails numerous compliance concerns. This is even more so, in view of the high turnover rate that has been noted in the retail sector, with Korn Ferry at 81% among their part time hourly employees. However, there is hardly any room for complacency when it comes to training compliance skills and this industry is characterized by high employee turnover rates. Training programs should, therefore, be designed in a manner that is easy to understand by the participants yet be sufficiently versatile to accommodate the various laws existing in the different regions. It can also pose issues since local managers may set their own policies, which may end up contradicting organizational policies. Therefore, corporate policies should follow those of the local legislation and middle managers should be in sync with broader corporate compliance goals to eliminate legal liabilities and promote the principles of ethics.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are significant reputational risks for retailers specifically; ethical sourcing and cybersecurity being some of them. Retailers need to ensure that they have strong measures for preventing or detecting the forms of unethical conduct in their supply chain such as slave labor. Furthermore, rapid replies, backed up by sound information about supplier vetting, will ensure that any time negative claims surface, the loss is also contained. Furthermore, for the retail sector, consideration should be given to cyber security issues especially at a time organizations are increasingly outsourcing their data processing needs. Compliance programs must ensure proper use of data in order not to suffer loss of data or raise the ire of customers at a later date. Measures like application of technology and the approach to total risk management can help to navigate through these changes which appear challenging in the conditions of retail markets today.\\n\\n**Legal and Compliance Considerations in Cloud Computing**\\n\\nCloud computing's data privacy and security employment faces legal difficulties and jurisdictional problems.Â The emergence of data transfers and privacy compliance has become a major concern after the European Union (EU) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Â This has been further exacerbated by cloud services needing to base their GDPR compliance on studies [36].Â Public organizations must follow norms like GDPR, or their reputation will be damaged.Â Mozambique has no national cloud computing strategy [35].Â Furthermore, it reveals the significance of states following international regulations and standards.\\n\\nThe frameworks of regulation are the paths to move to the clouds.Â Such frameworks are developed by international organizations like ENISA, NIST, and ITU for data security and privacy regulations within cloud computing [35].Â On the other hand, GDPR studies on compliance highlight the essentiality of introducing mechanisms into the system like anonymizing data, encryption and contractual agreements to monitor the observance of the security aspects of personally identifiable information [36].Â They assure security as well as compliance in the course of overcoming legal challenges emanating from cloud computing by being compliant. This is demonstrated in Fig 3 below;\\n\\n![](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6InZoaXoxYWpyLzUxNzE3MjUxNTg5MTg2LmpwZWciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfX19)\\n\\n**Fig 3: Scaling-GRC-fullsize [45]**\\n\\nThe GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) relationship model depicts the interplay of governance, risk management, and compliance frameworks within an organization that seeks to ensure its regulatory adherence and risk mitigation, as shown in Fig 3.\\n\\nCase studies of how cloud computing was applied across different sectors, such as healthcare in Germany, show possible scenarios with difficulties and probabilities.Â The healthcare systems are increasingly using legislative reforms as stepping stones to introduce modern technologies such as cloud computing [37].Â Despite this, implementing cloud computing in healthcare should be accompanied by measures to safeguard health information without strictly following the rules and regulations. By sharing experiences and assessments, one will better understand the legal issues surrounding cloud adoption and make an informed decision about cloud implementation with the digital resources at their disposal.\\n\\nThe rapid growth of cloud computing has posed legal and compliance challenges that have affected different businesses. For instance, a survey that was carried out among compliant-cloud related topics reveals that, among the benefits that make many firms to centralize their core operations in cloud include its capability to expand, its flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. This in turn requires compliance to divers regulation like FISMA for government organizations, HIPAA for health organizations, SOX and PCI for retail business. An aspect in compliance that has been highlighted above is that there is no full control or visibility into the cloud environment; making matters worse on issues such as security of data and compliance. External dependence on Cloud providers also increases this issue hence making these service providers to have increased responsibility and accountability.\\n\\nConsequently, addressing compliant issues in Cloud Computing entails premeditated actions as well as constant vigilance because the responsibility never ends. It was identified that in the IT industry, decision makers need to familiarize themselves with the key compliance issues and potential aids so that they can adequately manage these threats. From this point of view it can also be affirmed that an architect, who constructs rich capabilities into the virtual environment, can justify failures during implementation; however, by common sense alone they should try not to let anything slip through. Moreover, Data security and user trust depends on two factors: responsibility with cloud service suppliers and LaaS (Legal-as-a-Service). By being conversant with all these based challenges can help businesses fully harness on the benefits of CC while at the same time observing both regulatory requirements on the one hand and data privacy on the other.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies and Compliance in Cloud Computing**\\n\\nCompliance management systems have often leveraged AI and ML machine technology to ensure precision and effectiveness.Â Such types of technology can process extraordinary amounts of information, which provides the ability to identify similarities or possible dangers and trends and variants related to them [38].Â With AI algorithms and ML, a firm can automate its regulations; thus, it will cut down on manual labor while enhancing the ability to identify and respond to regulatory requirements.Â Yet, implementing these systems in this region would give rise to certain data protection laws, algorithmic biases, and other relevant regulation concerns.\\n\\nBlockchain technology provides a ground for hypothesis, offering transparent, immutable, and decentralized systems for record-keeping and verification. Organizations can establish immutable blockchain-based trails of transactions and secure data integrity. This will ensure clarity and trust in the compliance process [39].Â In addition, through smart contracts, blockchain can enforce prescribed rules and conditions and cut out mediators, ensuring regulatory compliance.Â The obstacles, for example, scalability, interoperability, and regulatory uncertainties, are the most challenging factors in the wide-spreading adoption of blockchain solutions in compliance management.\\n\\nFuture trends in cloud compliance will cover multi-cloud settings, data privacy, zero-trust architectures, and AI-based security solutions.Â Driven by the growth of cloud computing, organizations must pay attention to their security measures to keep personal data secure and fulfil increasing regulatory requirements.Â Also, emerging technologies such as container security, serverless security, and cloud workload protection will be useful in personally addressing the unique security problems of cloud environments [40].Â Through the adoption of innovative technologies and proactive security policies, organizations can have a strong cloud compliance posture to manage the risks effectively.\\n\\n![](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6ImdtNG9xazQxLzQxNzE3MjUxNTg5MTg2LmpwZWciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfX19)\\n\\n**Fig 4: Emerging Technologies in the Cloud Computing [46]**\\n\\nThe fig.4 above represents the usage of IoT platforms in cloud computing where Smart connectivity is shown as the main trend. The merger of IoT devices and cloud-based services simplifies data sharing and processing, paves the way for new ideas, and cuts costs in various sectors.\\n\\nTable 1. Integration of a Compliance Capabilities Table for AWS, Azure, and GCP [49]\\n\\n| Compliance Requirements | AWS | AZURE | GCP |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| HIPAA Compliance | YES | YES | YES |\\n| PCI DSS Compliance | YES | YES | YES |\\n| GDPR Compliance | Partial (Tools Available) | YES | YES |\\n| FedRAMP Compliance | YES | YES | In Progress |\\n| FERPA Compliance | YES | YES | YES |\\n| GLBA Compliance | YES | YES | YES. |\\n\\nCompliance Requirements\\n\\nAWS\\n\\nAZURE\\n\\nGCP\\n\\nHIPAA Compliance\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nPCI DSS Compliance\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nGDPR Compliance\\n\\nPartial (Tools Available)\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nFedRAMP Compliance\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nIn Progress\\n\\nFERPA Compliance\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nGLBA Compliance\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES\\n\\nYES.\\n\\nThe table 1 focuses on how AWS, Azure and GCP respond to the major compliance standards namely HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, FedRAMP, FERPA and GLBA. This makes it easier for organizations to evaluate the compliance capacities of each of cloud service provider so that they can make right decision depending on the necessary regulatory requirements of their business. Table 1 also assists in selecting the right cloud service provider for regulation by indicating the features of compliance.\\n\\nThe AI provider advancements introduce the probability of rolling back difficulties of security, compliance, and regulation that are present in the key cloud service providers; AWS, Azure, GCP serving various sectors. It is therefore possible to employ technologies such as the AI that assist in automating activities like monitoring data, threats, and generating reports on compliance. For example, AWS has for instance the Amazon Macie for data discovery and classification while Azure has for instance Azure Security Center for threat detection and response. Similarly, Google Cloud provides web application security solutions among which Google Cloud Armor. These AI-based tools help organisations anticipate any compliance issues that might arise and fix them by enhancing the security of the whole cloud based environment for the organisation as well as addressing the security threats and regulatory measures.\\n\\nAmid the progress of cloud computing and the ever changing compliance rules and regulations, the business world is seeking for ways to optimise its compliance strategies. This is achieved through the use of multi-cloud hybrid solutions that enable the use of both public and private cloud solutions [48]. This makes it possible for hybrid cloud approach to handle some of the challenges that face cloud computing today in terms of compliance. This includes; a situation where a company has to store sensitive data that require high level of regulation may be stored in the private clouds since they promise more control and better security. On the other hand, the workloads that are non-sensitive or have fluctuating demand patterns could be run on the public cloud to improve scalability and save cost as well [48]. This model presents organizations with a chance to develop their infrastructure in a way that meets certain compliance requirements while at the same time ensuring that the organizations gain optimum results and returns on their resources. Besides, the three types of clouds ensure data integration and compatibility between them, which ensure compliance with regulations across distributed systems [48] Amidst the continuously shifting compliance landscape, it looks like the hybrid cloud offers an achievable approach by which compliance should be in a position to be enhanced, alongside the advantages being derive from the use of these services.\\n\\nOverall, examining compliance issues in different sectors shows the critical role of proactive measures in minimizing the risks associated with cloud computing.Â Regarding healthcare, the financial industry or government's ability to comply will depend on the data's sensitivity level and the regulatory landscape.Â Thus, organizations should implement holistic compliance strategies that involve reliable security protocols, consistent monitoring, and collaboration with compliance experts and service providers. Organizations must embrace emerging tech solutions such as ML, AI, and blockchain to enhance compliance management systems and make data secure and authentic.Â Moreover, by using unified knowledge representation and frameworks, as well as semantic techniques, compliance processes can be made more fluent, and regime automation can reduce manual work efforts and minimize the risk of non-compliance. Ahead is looking to the future promising but complex outlook for cloud compliance in different sectors.Â With the expansion of cloud computing and digital transformation, companies must stay alert to changes in compliance laws and emerging risks.Â Through innovative technologies, stakeholders work together and implement active security measures. Organizations can maintain a higher cloud compliance posture and manage compliance risks in this ever-changing digital space.\\n\\nTherefore, there is a need for governments and industry associations to concentrate on addressing the changing cloud computing problems through the formulation of harmonized regulatory structures and compliance demands. This may mean being in possession of well defined data protection policies which might include the issue of protocols such as encryption and access control, as well as checking up in order to assist in monitoring these policies. This may also involve promoting collaborations between the different organizations to form multi-stakeholder venturer partnerships aimed at sharing of good practices and know-how in order to enhance the cumulative compliance outcomes. In addition, it is suggested to provide bonuses for certifying cloud services; materials for training within the framework of legal requirements are also involved in the strengthening of amplification in the field.\\n\\n**References.**\\n\\nK.

The event explored the opportunities, challenges, and business environment constraints surrounding cloud and data infrastructure in emerging markets. Two key experts led the discussion: Minister Raúl Pérez Reyes Espejo, Peru's Minister of Transport and Communications, and Marcos Peigo, CEO of Scala Data Centers.\\n\\nMinister Raúl Pérez Reyes Espejo, appointed in March 2024, is the Minister of Transport and Communications for Peru. He has a distinguished career in both the public and private sectors, having served as Vice Minister of Energy and held senior positions at regulatory bodies for energy and telecommunications, including Osinergmin and Osiptel.\\n\\nMarcos Peigo is the CEO and Board Member of Scala Data Centers, the leading platform for sustainable hyperscale data centers in Latin America. With a robust background in the tech industry, he has held various senior roles, including Vice President of Value Creation at IBM Latin America, and is also an Operating Partner at DigitalBridge.\\n\\nThe following Q&A summarizes the key highlights and takeaways from their insightful discussion:\\n\\n**Q1:** *Marcos, in your view, why is cloud infrastructure so important for developing countries?*\\n\\n**A1:** Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important topic. It's impossible to consider that any significant development in a country can occur without the support of digital infrastructure. When you think about the biggest challenges facing developing countries, such as education, healthcare, and access to public services, it's clear that digital infrastructure is essential for delivering these services more effectively.\\n\\nCloud infrastructure plays a critical role, not just by providing access to smarter services at a lower cost but also by ensuring equal access to these services for the entire population. For some countries, the cloud infrastructure will generate revenue and income, but for most, it will generate progress, which is even more important than the business aspect.\\n\\nWhen we started Scala, we identified significant inequalities in cloud infrastructure in Latin America. For instance, Latin America had eight times fewer cloud on-ramps than Europe and 20 times fewer than North America. We saw this as an opportunity to develop a data center company that could help bridge this gap. We also focused on improving power efficiency and addressing issues like currency volatility and data sovereignty, which are crucial for sustainable development.\\n\\nIn essence, the question is whether demand will drive infrastructure development or vice versa. We decided to take the first step in Brazil and create a Latin American platform. Our initial business plan projected 70 MW of capacity by the end of 2028, but we've already reached 160 MW in just three and a half years. Now, with the AI revolution, we project 800 MW by 2028, which will require an additional $5 billion investment on top of the $2 billion already committed.\\n\\n**![Shape](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAANSURBVBhXY2BgYGAAAAAFAAGKM+MAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)**\\n\\n![Shape](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAANSURBVBhXY2BgYGAAAAAFAAGKM+MAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\\n\\n**Q2:** *Minister Perez, we were impressed by the projected growth of Peru's public cloud market, which is expected to reach $1 billion this year and continue growing at a double-digit rate until 2028. How is Peru attracting this scale of investment, and what support does Peru or other developing countries need from development partners like the IFC and the World Bank?*\\n\\n**A2:** Peru is actively working to expand its data and cloud infrastructure market, driven by the adoption of digital technologies and cloud-based services in various sectors. This growth is supported by the implementation of 5G networks, AI, the Internet of Things, and big data, as well as digital transformation in general.\\n\\nTo sustain and accelerate this growth, support from development partners is crucial, especially in terms of technology investment and capacity building. Stakeholders can help improve existing infrastructure, develop new data center capabilities, and implement regulations that facilitate investment and operation of cloud services. International collaboration and the exchange of technical knowledge are essential to strengthen the local market.\\n\\nPeru's government has launched a national digital transformation policy to promote digitalization across economic and social sectors. This policy includes regulatory frameworks to increase trust in cloud services and data infrastructure, with a focus on personal data protection and cybersecurity.\\n\\n**Q3:** *Minister Perez, how is Peru considering the potential for regional integration of cloud and data markets in Latin America, especially given that low- and middle-income countries currently account for only 25% of global data center capacity?*\\n\\n**A3:** The key factors driving the growth of the cloud infrastructure services market include cost reduction, scalability, flexibility, and security. These services enable rapid development and execution of applications and processes. Regional integration is seen as a fundamental strategy to attract investment and improve technological capacity across Latin America.\\n\\nFor example, the South Pacific submarine cable, implemented in 2021, connected Peru with other countries in the region, improving connectivity and capacity. However, challenges such as regulatory diversity between countries, the need for significant investment, and concerns about data sovereignty and security must be addressed.\\n\\nOvercoming these obstacles requires coordinated efforts to establish standards, encourage cross-border investment, and ensure effective data protection policies. Peru, like other developing countries in Latin America, views regional integration as a strategy to attract investment and address challenges related to limited data center capacity.\\n\\n![Shape](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAANSURBVBhXY2BgYGAAAAAFAAGKM+MAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)**Q4:** *Marcos, what incentives could encourage smaller markets to consider regional data centers, or would they still prefer to attract individual investors like yourself despite data sovereignty concerns?*\\n\\n![Shape](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAANSURBVBhXY2BgYGAAAAAFAAGKM+MAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\\n\\n**A4:** That's a very good question. When we think about the internet and the benefits that connectivity has brought us over the past 20 years, we should think similarly about the cloud and AI. Connectivity depends on the level of connectivity a country can provide. When it comes to the cloud, it's all about latency—the time it takes for data to travel and return. Unless you can change the speed of light or wave propagation, you need to be closer to where the data is captured and consumed.\\n\\nThe size of the cloud market for each country is connected to its development level in other dimensions, such as financial systems, government services, and retail. I don't see a small country becoming a major player in the data center landscape if it doesn't have a strong economy. But AI could change this dynamic by enabling new business models and applications, similar to how Africa leapfrogged to 3G telecommunications. Investments in education and professional training will be crucial to drive economies forward.\\n\\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, AI can be split into training and [inference](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/inference-vs-training/#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20artificial,an%20AI%20model%20in%20action). Training requires significant data processing, which can be done anywhere with ample power and infrastructure. Inference, which uses smaller data sets, needs to be close to where data is accessed. This presents an opportunity for countries like Brazil and Chile to become global hubs for AI training, leveraging their existing power grid and infrastructure.\\n\\n**Q5:** *Marcos, you mentioned that sustainability is a must-have rather than a nice-to-have for your company. How do you ensure your data centers remain sustainable, and are there any regulatory barriers that you face in this effort?*\\n\\n**A5:** For us, sustainability is not just a strategy; it's a commitment. For example, in Mexico, we could have at least 100 MW of capacity, but we currently have only five because we couldn't rely on the grid's renewable energy sources. So, we decided not to expand there and instead focused on Chile.\\n\\nWe only build data centers that can be sustainable, meaning zero water usage and 100% renewable energy. Scala was the first data center company in Latin America to operate with 100% renewables from day one, and the first in the Americas to achieve carbon neutrality certification. By setting this new standard, we've forced the market to follow our lead, even though renewable energy is currently more expensive.\\n\\nThe good news is that major companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Google also prioritize sustainability, which drives the entire industry to adopt these practices. However, as the demand for AI grows, the challenge will be maintaining these sustainability standards, especially when energy becomes scarce.\\n\\nThe industry needs to invest in renewables, improve the grid, and develop more efficient battery technologies. We must also consider alternative energy sources, such as nuclear power, to ensure that the growth of data centers is sustainable. If we don't address the infrastructure challenges now, we risk losing five to seven critical years of progress in sustainability.\\n\\n**Q6:** *Minister Perez, how does Peru plan to integrate its national infrastructure with the broader Latin American region to enhance data transmission and connectivity?*\\n\\n**A6:** Peru has a national fiber optic network that interconnects 108 provinces through 13,000 km of fiber optics and 3,322 points of presence across the country. Additionally, regional projects have increased the deployment of fiber optics by 27,500 km, totaling around 45,000 km. This infrastructure allows high-speed data transmission and positions Peru to integrate its networks with the broader Latin American region.\\n\\nHowever, regional integration will require significant investment in the construction and improvement of telecommunications and data center infrastructure. Countries must be willing to collaborate on joint infrastructure projects and create incentives to attract private investment. The goal is to harmonize policies and regulations related to data infrastructure and the cloud, which will involve overcoming differences in regulatory frameworks, data protection regulations, and cybersecurity across the region.\\n\\n![Group photo for cloud computing report launch](https://worldbank.scene7.com/is/image/worldbankprod/group-photo-cloud-computing-Q-A?wid=780&hei=439&qlt=85,0&resMode=sharp \\\"Group photo for cloud computing report launch\\\")\\n\\n(Left to rightt): Marcos Peigo, CEO and Co-Founder, Scala Data Centers, Brazil; Guangzhe Chen, Vice President for Infrastructure, The World Bank; Christine Zhenwei Qiang, Director, Digital Development, The World Bank; Mohamed Gouled, Vice President for Industries, IFC\\n\\n(Left to rightt): Marcos Peigo, CEO and Co-Founder, Scala Data Centers, Brazil; Guangzhe Chen, Vice President for Infrastructure, The World Bank; Christine Zhenwei Qiang, Director, Digital Development, The World Bank; Mohamed Gouled, Vice President for Industries, IFC\\n\\n![World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/media_1540be393bca9ed1fbc89eaa862044ccb08019dd2.svg?width=750&format=svg&optimize=medium)\\n\\n**STAY CURRENT** WITH OUR LATEST DATA & INSIGHTS\\n\\n© 2025 World Bank Group.

These services include computing power, storage, networking, databases, and other infrastructure elements, all hosted in data centers managed by the CSP. By leveraging a cloud providcer, users can access and scale these resources on-demand without having to manage or maintain the physical hardware themselves.\\n\\nCSPs typically offer their services through several models:\\n\\n*   **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.\\n*   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools for application development.\\n*   **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.\\n\\n**Benefits Of Cloud Providers Vs. On-Premises?**\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud providers offer several advantages over on-premises solutions, including**lower capital expenditures (CAPEX**) since there is no need for significant upfront investment in hardware. They also enable **faster time-to-market**by providing readily available resources. Additionally, cloud services offer**scalability and flexibility**, allowing businesses to easily adjust resources based on demand. With managed services and access to expert support, organizations benefit from **reduced maintenance burdens and enhanced reliability**. Cloud providers also offer **global reach and availability**, ensuring seamless access to services and data from anywhere in the world.\\n\\n**What are the Challenges Of Using a cloud provider?**\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**1. Data Security and Privacy Concerns**\\n\\nUsing a public cloud involves storing and processing data on third-party infrastructure, which can raise concerns about data security and privacy. Although CSPs implement stringent security measures, the shared nature of the cloud environment can still present risks.\\n\\n**2. Dependency and Vendor Lock-In**\\n\\nRelying heavily on a single Cloud Provider can lead to vendor lock-in, where switching providers becomes technically difficult or cost-prohibitive. Different CSPs have unique architectures, services, and APIs, which can make migration complex.\\n\\n**3. Cost Management and Visibility**\\n\\nWhile cloud computing can be cost-effective, it can also lead to unexpected expenses if not managed properly. The pay-as-you-go model is convenient, but without proper oversight, costs can spiral out of control. Businesses need to implement robust cost management practices and use tools to gain visibility into their cloud spending.\\n\\n[![Image 5: Top cloud providers finops platform](https://holori.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/holori-blog-finops-platform-1-1024x562.png)](https://app.holori.com/)\\n\\n**4. Limited Control Over Infrastructure**\\n\\nWhile cloud providers offer managed services, some businesses may feel constrained by the limited control they have over the underlying infrastructure. This can be a concern for companies with specific performance, compliance, or customization needs that the CSP’s standard offerings may not meet.\\n\\n**5. Performance and Reliability Issues**\\n\\nAlthough CSPs aim for high availability and performance, outages and service disruptions can still occur. Businesses relying on CSPs must have contingency plans, such as multi-region deployments or hybrid cloud solutions, to mitigate the impact of any potential downtime.\\n\\n**Cloud market share 2024 in a nutshell**\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nThe [cloud computing market](https://holori.com/cloud-market-share-2024-aws-azure-gcp/) continues its impressive growth. According to Canalys, total spending on cloud infrastructure services surged by 18% in 2023, reaching $290.4 billion, up from $247.1 billion in 2022. This growth trend has accelerated into the first quarter of 2024, with Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and AWS reporting year-over-year quarterly growth of 31%, 28%, and 17%, respectively.\\n\\nThe market is predominantly controlled by three major players, who together hold 67% of the market share. AWS leads with 31%, followed closely by Azure at 25%, and Google Cloud at 11%.\\n\\nDespite AWS’s slightly lower quarterly growth compared to Azure and GCP, its market share has remained stable over the years. Azure has seen significant gains, doubling its market share from 12% to 25% in just seven years, largely due to its strong enterprise network and ability to attract large customers. Similarly, GCP has also doubled its market share over the past six years and recently achieved profitability.\\n\\nAs AI continues to drive cloud market expansion, there is growing speculation about whether AWS can maintain its dominance. Azure’s significant investment in OpenAI and GCP’s success with Bard/Gemini and its reputation in AI and machine learning pose serious competition. AWS’s $4 billion investment in Anthropic is notable, but whether it will be enough remains to be seen.\\n\\n![Image 6: cloud market share 2024](https://holori.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-5-1024x614.png)\\n\\n**Top Cloud Providers In 2024**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n### **1.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the [**5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Market Share in 2024**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-biggest-cloud-providers-by-market-share-in-2024-1261618/). \\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has fueled a rapid shift towards cloud adoption, with projections indicating that global spending on cloud services and related components will exceed [$1.0 trillion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201015005069/en/Cloud-Adoption-and-Opportunities-Will-Continue-to-Expand-Leading-to-a-1-Trillion-Market-in-2024-According-to-IDC) in 2024, maintaining a CAGR of 15.7%. \\n\\nMoreover, the global cloud services market is witnessing major growth, with a projected value of [$2.19 trillion by 2032](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/cloud-services-market), with a CAGR of 17.10% from 2023. In 2022, North America held a dominant market share of 42%, driven by a strong emphasis on digitalization, particularly in sectors like IoT, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Large enterprises accounted for 52% of the market share in 2022, reflecting their investment in cloud solutions for enhanced agility and efficiency.\\n\\nThe market is segmented by deployment, with private clouds leading in 2022 with a share of over 47%, offering organizations greater control and security. However, hybrid clouds are expected to witness rapid growth, driven by SMEs adopting cloud-based solutions for productivity enhancement and cost reduction. Software as a Service (SaaS) dominated the market in 2022 due to its ease of deployment and cost-effectiveness, while Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is projected to grow rapidly, fueled by the demand for hybrid cloud platforms and robust data storage solutions.\\n\\nIn terms of region, Asia Pacific is anticipated to experience exponential growth, fueled by increasing demand from sectors such as manufacturing and healthcare. Additionally, key market developments, such as collaborations between companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:[WBA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WBA)) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:[MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)), underscore the growing importance of cloud technology in revolutionizing different industries. \\n\\nMoreover, AI-as-a-Service is democratizing AI through cloud platforms, enabling businesses to harness transformative technologies without heavy investment. Leveraging vast compute power and data, AI models like ChatGPT are trained, offering economic and social benefits. Predicted to rise from 76% to 85%, multi-cloud strategies provide cost and flexibility advantages but pose challenges in data governance and integration. \\n\\nHybrid cloud solutions combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services are also gaining popularity, allowing organizations to balance security and flexibility. In 2024, real-time cloud infrastructure is becoming equally vital, as organizations are prioritizing up-to-the-minute insights over stale data. Streamed data consumption is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for instant access storage like Flash and solid-state devices. This shift accommodates trends such as cloud gaming and streamed entertainment from platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:[NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX)) and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:[SPOT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPOT)), indicating a growing demand for real-time data handling capabilities.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (CGP) are the **top three cloud providers in the world in 2024**. \\n\\nOn the financial end, in the fourth quarter of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:[AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN))’s cloud division, AWS, witnessed a revenue growth of 13% year over year, hitting $24.20 billion, meeting analysts' expectations precisely. This growth was attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud services for artificial intelligence, with AWS introducing products like the Q chatbot and the Trainium2 chip. Despite this growth, AWS faced stiff competition from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Azure and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG))'s Google Cloud, which saw revenue increases of 30% and 26%, respectively. However, AWS maintained its position as a major contributor to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s  overall revenue, representing 14% of the company's total earnings.\\n\\nOperating income for AWS in the fourth quarter stood at $7.17 billion, surpassing StreetAccount's consensus by approximately 38%. This stable performance further solidified AWS's continued profitability and dominance in the cloud services market. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s decision to extend the useful life of its servers to six years is projected to bolster first-quarter operating income by $900 million.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with analysts estimating Azure to now be about three-quarters the size of its top competitor, compared to being only half its size five years ago.

HG Insights identified nearly 350,000 businesses using Azure cloud computing solutions.\\n\\nMicrosoft launched Azure, an open and flexible cloud computing platform, in 2010 and positioned it as an alternative to Amazon EC2 and Google App Engine. To this day, Azure is locked in a heated competition — the so-called “Cloud Wars” — with the other two cloud giants: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\\n\\nHowever, the cloud infrastructure services market remains highly dynamic as AWS and Google compete with Microsoft for increased cloud spending. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-07-18-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-revenue-grew-30-percent-in-2022-exceeding-100-billion-for-the-first-time) says that in 2022, the worldwide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) market grew 30%, exceeding $100 billion for the first time.\\n\\nIn this report, you’ll find a detailed overview of the Azure market and trends shaping the ecosystem today. \\n\\n## 2024 Azure Market Insights\\n\\nHG Insights collects data on the businesses buying Azure cloud services. Here are a few key takeaways from the [2024 Azure Market Report](https://explore.hginsights.com/microsoft-azure-ecosystem-in-24): \\n\\n## Microsoft Azure Market Share\\n\\nAs has been the case every year since the first cloud product was introduced, the “Cloud Wars” between AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud is a huge driver for the industry’s overall trajectory. All three of the leading providers have shown positive YoY growth in customer count every year since 2019, illustrating the intensity of competition to capture market share.\\n\\n### GCP vs AWS vs Azure market share\\n\\n![GCP vs AWS vs Azure market share](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GCP-vs-AWS-vs-Azure-market-share-1.png)\\n\\n![GCP vs AWS vs Azure market share](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GCP-vs-AWS-vs-Azure-market-share-1.png)\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure market share reached 24% of the cloud computing market in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, AWS retained 31% and GCP came in a distant third, capturing 11% market share. From 2023 to 2024, Azure’s customer base grew by 14.2%, while AWS and GCP grew by 24.6% and 23.2%, respectively. \\n\\nWhile Azure’s customer base grew the least year-over-year out of the top three cloud providers, the influence of 310 new enterprise customers had an outsized impact on Azure market share. \\n\\n### The Microsoft Azure Buyer Landscape in 2024\\n\\n![microsoft azure market share](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-azure-market-share-1.png)\\n\\n![microsoft azure market share](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-azure-market-share-1.png)\\n\\nThe highest volume of Azure customers are in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and North America (NA), with more than 130,000 buyers in each region.\\n\\nMicrosoft has over 60 global data center regions, more than any other cloud provider. The company has been expanding cloud infrastructure to support demand “as organizations focus on migrating to the cloud and building new solutions that take advantage of AI.”\\n\\n![azure customer growth](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/azure-customer-growth-1.png)\\n\\n![azure customer growth](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/azure-customer-growth-1.png)\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure achieved positive year-over- year (YoY) customer growth across all company sizes from 2023 to 2024, with the Startup segment growing the fastest YoY at 23%. In contrast, from 2022 to 2023, Azure’s Startup customer count grew by 17.6%.\\n\\nWhile year-over-year growth in Enterprise customers was the lowest of the four segments, those additional 310 Enterprise customers likely made an outsized impact on revenue growth.\\n\\n![microsoft azure cloud spending](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-azure-cloud-spending-1.png)\\n\\n![microsoft azure cloud spending](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-azure-cloud-spending-1.png)\\n\\nMore than three-quarters of Azure customers (78%) are in the lowest spending tier, with less than $1k in monthly spend. However, from 2023 to 2024, Azure customers increased across all revenue tiers.\\n\\nTo dig in deeper, we analyzed the cloud spending of Azure customers in three trending industries: Media, Education, and Internet.\\n\\n![microsoft azure market](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsft-azure-market-1.png)\\n\\n![microsoft azure market](https://hginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsft-azure-market-1.png)\\n\\nThis chart shows the number of companies with detected Azure installations, grouped by industry and estimated monthly Azure spend. While not the largest industry by total customers, the Internet sector has the most Azure buyers (64) spending more than $100,000 per month.\\n\\n## Trends Shaping the Microsoft Azure Ecosystem in 2024\\n\\nHG Insights’ combination of detailed usage and spend data with industry-level detail allows us to understand adoption rate and potential by business type.

In 2024, the competition among **cloud service providers (CSPs)** continues to intensify as they introduce new services, improve infrastructure, and optimize pricing. Choosing the right CSP is crucial for businesses seeking reliable services, enhanced security, and seamless integration across multiple platforms.\\n\\nThis blog explores the **top 10 cloud service providers** of 2024 and provides an overview of their features, market relevance, and key strengths. Additionally, we will highlight important considerations when selecting a cloud provider and how CloudOptimo can enhance your cloud experience. Whether you're looking for a high-performing infrastructure, competitive pricing, or advanced AI and machine learning tools, this guide will help you make the right choice.\\n\\nWe will also discuss how CSPs compare to **on-premises infrastructure** and examine the top benefits of cloud computing to illustrate why so many enterprises are moving their workloads to the cloud.\\n\\n#### **History Before Cloud Service Providers**\\n\\nBefore cloud service providers (CSPs) emerged, businesses primarily relied on on-premises infrastructure, which involved substantial capital investment, maintenance, and management. This traditional model often posed challenges, as organizations had to predict their computing needs well in advance and invest accordingly, leading to limitations in scalability and flexibility.\\n\\nIn the early days of computing, companies operated on local servers and mainframes, managing their own hardware and software. This setup came with significant drawbacks, including high costs, lengthy deployment times, and difficulties in data management and recovery.\\n\\nThe introduction of virtualization in the late 1990s marked a pivotal shift in the IT landscape. Virtualization allowed multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, paving the way for more efficient resource utilization and setting the stage for the rise of cloud computing.\\n\\nBy the mid-2000s, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering cloud services, enabling businesses to rent computing resources on demand. This revolutionary shift transformed the way organizations approached IT. With cloud computing, companies could scale their operations without the burden of extensive capital expenditure. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of these cloud solutions quickly gained popularity, leading to the establishment of various CSPs that now dominate the market.\\n\\n#### **What Are Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)?**\\n\\nToday**Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** offer on-demand computing resources such as storage, servers, databases, and networking solutions, enabling businesses to operate flexibly without investing in physical infrastructure. CSPs provide a wide range of services, including **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**.\\n\\nMajor providers like **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud** have built global infrastructure networks to offer seamless scalability, high availability, and redundancy. Additionally, CSPs often provide advanced security, AI tools, and analytics platforms, making them a vital part of digital transformation strategies.\\n\\nThese providers play a critical role in supporting businesses of all sizes, from startups looking to minimize upfront infrastructure costs to enterprises leveraging **multi-cloud environments** to optimize performance. With an ever-growing demand for cloud-based solutions, understanding the key players in the CSP space helps companies align their IT strategy with their business goals.\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Service Model** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Use Case** |\\n| **IaaS** | Virtualized resources like servers and storage | AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine | Hosting virtual machines and storage solutions |\\n| **PaaS** | Platforms for developing and deploying apps | Microsoft Azure App Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Web app development and deployment |\\n| **SaaS** | Fully managed applications | Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 | Collaboration tools, CRMs, and productivity apps |\\n\\n#### **Cloud Service Providers vs. On-Premises Infrastructure: Key Benefits**\\n\\n![Cloud Infrastructure vs On-Premise Infrastructure](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/vs_7cf1903b50.png)\\n\\n![Cloud Infrastructure vs On-Premise Infrastructure](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/vs_7cf1903b50.png)\\n\\nBusinesses once relied solely on **on-premises data centers** to manage their operations. However, the adoption of cloud computing has introduced several advantages that make it a more appealing option. One of the key benefits of **cloud service providers (CSPs)** is **scalability**. With cloud infrastructure, businesses can easily adjust their computing resources to meet demand without over-provisioning or investing in excess hardware.\\n\\nAnother major benefit is **cost-efficiency**. On-premises setups require significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs, while cloud providers operate on a pay-as-you-go model. Companies can also benefit from **global accessibility**, as cloud providers maintain data centers worldwide, enabling users to access services from any location with minimal latency.\\n\\nAdditionally, **disaster recovery** and **data security** are easier to manage in the cloud. CSPs offer built-in backup solutions and adhere to industry compliance standards, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of data breaches. With providers taking care of updates and patches, businesses can focus on growth instead of infrastructure management.\\n\\nIn summary, shifting from on-premises to cloud infrastructure empowers organizations with **agility, security, and cost savings**—critical elements for success in a competitive environment.\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Factor** | **Cloud Service Providers** | **On-Premises Infrastructure** |\\n| **Initial Cost** | Low (Pay-as-you-go model) | High (Hardware investment) |\\n| **Scalability** | High (Instantly scalable) | Limited (Requires new hardware) |\\n| **Maintenance** | Managed by the provider | Managed internally (costly) |\\n| **Security** | Built-in security features | Must be managed in-house |\\n| **Disaster Recovery** | Automated and built-in | Requires manual setup and management |\\n| **Deployment Speed** | Fast (minutes or hours) | Slow (days or weeks) |\\n\\n#### **Key Factors to Consider When Selecting a Cloud Service Provider**\\n\\nChoosing the right cloud service provider is crucial for businesses looking to leverage cloud technology effectively. Here are the key factors to consider:\\n\\nWith these key factors in mind, let's examine the top cloud service providers of 2024, each of which has demonstrated excellence in many of these areas.\\n\\n#### **Top Cloud Service Providers of 2024**\\n\\nAs the cloud computing landscape continues to evolve, several providers have emerged as leaders in the field. Here’s a list of top 10 Cloud Service Providers of 2024 By Market Share:\\n\\nHere’s an overview of the top cloud service providers in 2024:\\n\\n**1.

The company’s existing data centers are located in the following markets:\\n\\n*   **United States:** Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Fremont, California; Newark, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C.\\n*   **Americas:** São Paulo, Brazil and Toronto, Canada\\n*   **Europe:** Paris, France; Frankfurt, Germany; Milan, Italy; Stockholm, Sweden; and London, United Kingdom\\n*   **Asia Pacific:** Sydney, Australia; Mumbai, India; Chennai, India; Tokyo, Japan; Osaka, Japan; and Singapore\\n\\n![Image 64: Linode Akamai Regions Data Centers Displayed on Map for 2023](blob:http://localhost/9e445e248ab91bc9145dd5a49ccfb501)\\n\\n[Click here for a larger version of this image.](https://dgtlinfra.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Linode-Cloud-Regions-Data-Centers-Map-2023.jpg)\\n\\nAdditionally, Linode plans to open 7 new cloud regions in the following markets: Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Madrid, Spain; Jakarta, Indonesia; Auckland, New Zealand; and Seoul, South Korea.\\n\\n**Which Cloud Service Provider Has the Largest Market Share?**\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are the cloud service providers with the largest market share, collectively capturing over 65% of spending on cloud infrastructure services. Below is a summary table of the top 10 cloud service providers by market share, highlighting AWS’ 31% market share, Microsoft Azure’s 24% market share, and Google Cloud’s 11.5% market share.\\n\\n**#****Cloud Service Provider****Market Share**\\n1 Amazon Web Services (AWS)31%\\n2 Microsoft Azure 24%\\n3 Google Cloud Platform (GCP)11.5%\\n4 Alibaba Cloud 4%\\n5 Oracle Cloud 3%\\n6 IBM Cloud 2.5%\\n7 Tencent Cloud 2%\\n8 OVHcloud<1%\\n9 DigitalOcean<1%\\n10 Linode (Akamai)<1%\\n\\nOver the past 5 years, AWS has maintained its market share in the low-30% range, Microsoft Azure has been an aggressive market share gainer, rising from approximately 10% historically, while Google Cloud has been steadily increasing its market share from its prior base of 5%. With market share gainers, there are also corresponding market share losers over this time period, which include IBM Cloud and a number of small cloud service providers.\\n\\n**Who are the Small Cloud Service Providers?**\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile the top 10 cloud service providers capture approximately 78% of spending on cloud infrastructure services, there is still a significant number of small vendors present in global markets. For example, these cloud service providers include those targeting a certain niche, such as small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) or ones that operate regionally, such as in Europe or Asia Pacific. Below are examples of these small cloud service providers:\\n\\n*   **China:** Baidu AI Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Kingsoft Cloud, JD Cloud, QingCloud, UCloud\\n*   **Europe:** Bleu (Orange and Capgemini), Hetzner, Leaseweb\\n*   **Japan and Korea:** Fujitsu, NTT, SoftBank, NAVER Cloud, KT Cloud\\n*   **Private Cloud / Managed Services:** Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Rackspace, VMware\\n*   **SaaS Partners:** Salesforce, SAP\\n*   **SMBs:** Heroku, UpCloud, Vultr\\n\\nWithin the cloud service provider market, there is an important distinction to make for managed services providers like Rackspace. Managed services providers help enterprises migrate, architect, and deploy workloads to the public cloud. Subsequently, these managed services providers ‘manage’ the IT infrastructure for their customers across multiple environments, including public cloud, [private cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/private-cloud-computing/), and [on-premises](https://dgtlinfra.com/on-premise-to-cloud-migration/). Through this business model, the cloud service providers still remain as the ultimate owners and providers of IT infrastructure.\\n\\n**What are Cloud Service Providers?**\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud service providers offer on-demand infrastructure and tools for developers, start-ups, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises to build, deploy, and scale their software applications and databases. The two main [service models](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-service-models-iaas-paas-saas/) which cloud service providers operate in are known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which are comprised of the following:\\n\\n*   **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** compute, storage, and networking\\n*   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** database management systems and application platforms\\n\\nWith this combined IaaS and PaaS infrastructure, cloud service providers enable a wide range of use cases, including web & mobile applications, website hosting, e-commerce, media & gaming, managed services, among many more. These computing and storage services rely on shared servers which offer a high degree of scalability and continuity. Typically, customers consume cloud computing services on a pay-per-use basis.\\n\\nAdditionally, certain public cloud service providers offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), which refers to end user applications.\\n\\n### Regions and Availability Zones Explained\\n\\nCloud service providers build their digital infrastructure around what are known as **regions** and **availability zones**. A **region** is a physical location in the world where a cloud service provider has multiple **availability zones**. These **availability zones** consist of one or more isolated **data centers**, that are housed in separate buildings, each with redundant power, cooling, networking, and fiber-optic connectivity.\\n\\n#### **_Regions and Availability Zones – Example_**\\n\\n![Image 66: Microsoft Azure Regions and Availability Zones](blob:http://localhost/dd1e941cf4c1eb5a974c7686ab7e2bdf)\\n\\nAvailability zones enable end users to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than is possible from an individual data center.\\n\\n**READ MORE:****[Cloud Regions and Availability Zones – Explained](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-regions-availability-zones/)**\\n\\n### Virtualization – A Key Advantage of the Cloud\\n\\nCloud service providers differentiate themselves from the capabilities of individual servers and data centers through virtualization, which means adding an abstraction layer between hardware and applications. In turn, virtualization enables multiple workloads and operating systems to run on the same physical server. As such, virtualization facilitates the critical competitive advantages of the cloud, including scalability, maximizing resource utilization, and provisioning more workloads with lower operating expenses.\\n\\n**READ MORE:****[Top 250 Data Center Companies in the World](https://dgtlinfra.com/top-data-center-companies/)**\\n\\n**What are the 5 Benefits of Cloud Computing?**\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe 5 benefits of cloud computing are scalability, pay-per-use, speed & agility, outsourcing, and global reach:\\n\\n1.   **Scalability:** an enterprise’s internal IT systems may not be scalable to meet peak demand for workloads, unless they maintain excess capacity – _which is costly_. By using cloud computing, customers can instantly increase or decrease their hardware and software capacity needs to meet business requirements\\n2.   **Pay-Per-Use:** instead of investing [capital expenditures (CapEx)](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-hyperscale-capex/) in data centers and servers prior to knowing how they are going to be used, customers can pay only when they consume computing resources, and pay only for how much they consume\\n3.   **Speed and Agility:** new IT resources can be provisioned in a cloud computing environment with only a few clicks. Therefore, customers can reduce the time to make those resources available to developers from weeks to just minutes\\n4.   **Outsourcing:** cloud computing enables customers to avoid racking, stacking, and powering servers, in addition to eschewing the ongoing maintenance of their data centers\\n5.   **Global Reach:** applications can be deployed in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. In turn, this enables applications to have lower latency and provides a better experience for end users\\n\\nAt the same time, a significant number of enterprises are shifting to **hybrid** and **multi-cloud** environments to avoid vendor lock-in and to preserve the flexibility to host sensitive workloads in a more secure environment. Below are definitions of [hybrid cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/hybrid-cloud-computing/) and [multi-cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/multi-cloud-computing/):\\n\\n*   **Hybrid Cloud:** application deployments in a combination of different environments including on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud\\n*   **Multi-Cloud:** application deployments with several public cloud service providers, instead of only using a single public cloud service provider\\n\\n**Which Cloud Service Provider is Cheapest?**\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo answer the questions: Which is cheapest cloud provider? and How much do cloud computing services cost?, Dgtl Infra reviewed a [recent comparison by Linode](https://www.linode.com/), which studied the cost per month of a CPU Dedicated/Optimized 2vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD deployment. Below is a summary of the monthly costs for this deployment from the four largest public cloud service providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Alibaba Cloud:\\n\\n**#****Cloud Service Provider****Cost per Month****% Higher**\\n1 Alibaba Cloud$48.42—\\n2 Google Cloud Platform (GCP)$63.38 31%\\n3 Microsoft Azure$70.05 45%\\n4 Amazon Web Services (AWS)$71.47 48%\\n\\nAs shown in the example above, for the CPU Dedicated/Optimized 2vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD deployment, **Alibaba Cloud was the cheapest** public cloud service provider at $48.42 per month. In contrast, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the most expensive** public cloud service provider, at a cost of $71.47 per month, 48% higher than Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\nAlthough the above analysis highlights the cheapest public cloud service provider among the **large** vendors, in reality the **smaller** cloud service providers, such as OVHcloud, DigitalOcean, and Linode are the most cost-effective. These companies are generally **at least** 20% to 35% cheaper across the board – _and often 50%+ cheaper_ – when compared to AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\n[![Image 68](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://eepurl.com/hndE5n)\\n\\n*   TAGS\\n*   [Amazon Web Services](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/amazon-web-services/)\\n*   [Cloud Computing](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/cloud-computing/)\\n*   [Data Centers](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/data-centers/)\\n*   [Google Cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/google-cloud/)\\n*   [Microsoft Azure](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/microsoft-azure/)\\n*   [Oracle Cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/oracle-cloud/)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdgtlinfra.com%2Ftop-cloud-service-providers%2F \\\"Facebook\\\")[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdgtlinfra.com%2Ftop-cloud-service-providers%2F&via=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdgtlinfra \\\"Twitter\\\")[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024%20%0A%0A%20https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/ \\\"WhatsApp\\\")[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/&title=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024 \\\"Linkedin\\\")[Email](mailto:?subject=Top%2010%20Cloud%20Service%20Providers%20Globally%20in%202024&body=https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/ \\\"Email\\\")\\n\\n[](https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/# \\\"More\\\")\\n\\n[![Image 70: Mary Zhang](blob:http://localhost/6fcdd002675ad5f0c4c308bbbda322e2)](https://dgtlinfra.com/author/marydgtlinfra/)\\n\\n[Mary Zhang](https://dgtlinfra.com/author/marydgtlinfra/)\\n\\nMary Zhang covers Data Centers for Dgtl Infra, including Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX), Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), CyrusOne, CoreSite Realty, QTS Realty, Switch Inc, Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM), Cyxtera (NASDAQ: CYXT), and many more.

In 2024, the competition among **cloud service providers (CSPs)** continues to intensify as they introduce new services, improve infrastructure, and optimize pricing. Choosing the right CSP is crucial for businesses seeking reliable services, enhanced security, and seamless integration across multiple platforms.\\n\\nThis blog explores the **top 10 cloud service providers** of 2024 and provides an overview of their features, market relevance, and key strengths. Additionally, we will highlight important considerations when selecting a cloud provider and how CloudOptimo can enhance your cloud experience. Whether you're looking for a high-performing infrastructure, competitive pricing, or advanced AI and machine learning tools, this guide will help you make the right choice.\\n\\nWe will also discuss how CSPs compare to **on-premises infrastructure** and examine the top benefits of cloud computing to illustrate why so many enterprises are moving their workloads to the cloud.\\n\\n#### **History Before Cloud Service Providers**\\n\\nBefore cloud service providers (CSPs) emerged, businesses primarily relied on on-premises infrastructure, which involved substantial capital investment, maintenance, and management. This traditional model often posed challenges, as organizations had to predict their computing needs well in advance and invest accordingly, leading to limitations in scalability and flexibility.\\n\\nIn the early days of computing, companies operated on local servers and mainframes, managing their own hardware and software. This setup came with significant drawbacks, including high costs, lengthy deployment times, and difficulties in data management and recovery.\\n\\nThe introduction of virtualization in the late 1990s marked a pivotal shift in the IT landscape. Virtualization allowed multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server, paving the way for more efficient resource utilization and setting the stage for the rise of cloud computing.\\n\\nBy the mid-2000s, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering cloud services, enabling businesses to rent computing resources on demand. This revolutionary shift transformed the way organizations approached IT. With cloud computing, companies could scale their operations without the burden of extensive capital expenditure. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of these cloud solutions quickly gained popularity, leading to the establishment of various CSPs that now dominate the market.\\n\\n#### **What Are Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)?**\\n\\nToday**Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** offer on-demand computing resources such as storage, servers, databases, and networking solutions, enabling businesses to operate flexibly without investing in physical infrastructure. CSPs provide a wide range of services, including **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**.\\n\\nMajor providers like **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud** have built global infrastructure networks to offer seamless scalability, high availability, and redundancy. Additionally, CSPs often provide advanced security, AI tools, and analytics platforms, making them a vital part of digital transformation strategies.\\n\\nThese providers play a critical role in supporting businesses of all sizes, from startups looking to minimize upfront infrastructure costs to enterprises leveraging **multi-cloud environments** to optimize performance. With an ever-growing demand for cloud-based solutions, understanding the key players in the CSP space helps companies align their IT strategy with their business goals.\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Service Model** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Use Case** |\\n| **IaaS** | Virtualized resources like servers and storage | AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine | Hosting virtual machines and storage solutions |\\n| **PaaS** | Platforms for developing and deploying apps | Microsoft Azure App Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Web app development and deployment |\\n| **SaaS** | Fully managed applications | Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 | Collaboration tools, CRMs, and productivity apps |\\n\\n#### **Cloud Service Providers vs. On-Premises Infrastructure: Key Benefits**\\n\\n![Cloud Infrastructure vs On-Premise Infrastructure](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/vs_7cf1903b50.png)\\n\\n![Cloud Infrastructure vs On-Premise Infrastructure](https://cms.cloudoptimo.com/uploads/vs_7cf1903b50.png)\\n\\nBusinesses once relied solely on **on-premises data centers** to manage their operations. However, the adoption of cloud computing has introduced several advantages that make it a more appealing option. One of the key benefits of **cloud service providers (CSPs)** is **scalability**. With cloud infrastructure, businesses can easily adjust their computing resources to meet demand without over-provisioning or investing in excess hardware.\\n\\nAnother major benefit is **cost-efficiency**. On-premises setups require significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs, while cloud providers operate on a pay-as-you-go model. Companies can also benefit from **global accessibility**, as cloud providers maintain data centers worldwide, enabling users to access services from any location with minimal latency.\\n\\nAdditionally, **disaster recovery** and **data security** are easier to manage in the cloud. CSPs offer built-in backup solutions and adhere to industry compliance standards, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of data breaches. With providers taking care of updates and patches, businesses can focus on growth instead of infrastructure management.\\n\\nIn summary, shifting from on-premises to cloud infrastructure empowers organizations with **agility, security, and cost savings**—critical elements for success in a competitive environment.\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Factor** | **Cloud Service Providers** | **On-Premises Infrastructure** |\\n| **Initial Cost** | Low (Pay-as-you-go model) | High (Hardware investment) |\\n| **Scalability** | High (Instantly scalable) | Limited (Requires new hardware) |\\n| **Maintenance** | Managed by the provider | Managed internally (costly) |\\n| **Security** | Built-in security features | Must be managed in-house |\\n| **Disaster Recovery** | Automated and built-in | Requires manual setup and management |\\n| **Deployment Speed** | Fast (minutes or hours) | Slow (days or weeks) |\\n\\n#### **Key Factors to Consider When Selecting a Cloud Service Provider**\\n\\nChoosing the right cloud service provider is crucial for businesses looking to leverage cloud technology effectively. Here are the key factors to consider:\\n\\nWith these key factors in mind, let's examine the top cloud service providers of 2024, each of which has demonstrated excellence in many of these areas.\\n\\n#### **Top Cloud Service Providers of 2024**\\n\\nAs the cloud computing landscape continues to evolve, several providers have emerged as leaders in the field. Here’s a list of top 10 Cloud Service Providers of 2024 By Market Share:\\n\\nHere’s an overview of the top cloud service providers in 2024:\\n\\n**1.

Below is a summary table of the top 10 cloud service providers by market share, highlighting AWS’ 31% market share, Microsoft Azure’s 24% market share, and Google Cloud’s 11.5% market share.\\n\\n**#****Cloud Service Provider****Market Share**\\n1 Amazon Web Services (AWS)31%\\n2 Microsoft Azure 24%\\n3 Google Cloud Platform (GCP)11.5%\\n4 Alibaba Cloud 4%\\n5 Oracle Cloud 3%\\n6 IBM Cloud 2.5%\\n7 Tencent Cloud 2%\\n8 OVHcloud<1%\\n9 DigitalOcean<1%\\n10 Linode (Akamai)<1%\\n\\nOver the past 5 years, AWS has maintained its market share in the low-30% range, Microsoft Azure has been an aggressive market share gainer, rising from approximately 10% historically, while Google Cloud has been steadily increasing its market share from its prior base of 5%. With market share gainers, there are also corresponding market share losers over this time period, which include IBM Cloud and a number of small cloud service providers.\\n\\n**Who are the Small Cloud Service Providers?**\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile the top 10 cloud service providers capture approximately 78% of spending on cloud infrastructure services, there is still a significant number of small vendors present in global markets. For example, these cloud service providers include those targeting a certain niche, such as small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) or ones that operate regionally, such as in Europe or Asia Pacific. Below are examples of these small cloud service providers:\\n\\n*   **China:** Baidu AI Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Kingsoft Cloud, JD Cloud, QingCloud, UCloud\\n*   **Europe:** Bleu (Orange and Capgemini), Hetzner, Leaseweb\\n*   **Japan and Korea:** Fujitsu, NTT, SoftBank, NAVER Cloud, KT Cloud\\n*   **Private Cloud / Managed Services:** Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Rackspace, VMware\\n*   **SaaS Partners:** Salesforce, SAP\\n*   **SMBs:** Heroku, UpCloud, Vultr\\n\\nWithin the cloud service provider market, there is an important distinction to make for managed services providers like Rackspace. Managed services providers help enterprises migrate, architect, and deploy workloads to the public cloud. Subsequently, these managed services providers ‘manage’ the IT infrastructure for their customers across multiple environments, including public cloud, [private cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/private-cloud-computing/), and [on-premises](https://dgtlinfra.com/on-premise-to-cloud-migration/). Through this business model, the cloud service providers still remain as the ultimate owners and providers of IT infrastructure.\\n\\n**What are Cloud Service Providers?**\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nCloud service providers offer on-demand infrastructure and tools for developers, start-ups, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises to build, deploy, and scale their software applications and databases. The two main [service models](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-service-models-iaas-paas-saas/) which cloud service providers operate in are known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which are comprised of the following:\\n\\n*   **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** compute, storage, and networking\\n*   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** database management systems and application platforms\\n\\nWith this combined IaaS and PaaS infrastructure, cloud service providers enable a wide range of use cases, including web & mobile applications, website hosting, e-commerce, media & gaming, managed services, among many more. These computing and storage services rely on shared servers which offer a high degree of scalability and continuity. Typically, customers consume cloud computing services on a pay-per-use basis.\\n\\nAdditionally, certain public cloud service providers offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), which refers to end user applications.\\n\\n### Regions and Availability Zones Explained\\n\\nCloud service providers build their digital infrastructure around what are known as **regions** and **availability zones**. A **region** is a physical location in the world where a cloud service provider has multiple **availability zones**. These **availability zones** consist of one or more isolated **data centers**, that are housed in separate buildings, each with redundant power, cooling, networking, and fiber-optic connectivity.\\n\\n#### **_Regions and Availability Zones – Example_**\\n\\n![Image 66: Microsoft Azure Regions and Availability Zones](blob:http://localhost/dd1e941cf4c1eb5a974c7686ab7e2bdf)\\n\\nAvailability zones enable end users to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than is possible from an individual data center.\\n\\n**READ MORE:****[Cloud Regions and Availability Zones – Explained](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-regions-availability-zones/)**\\n\\n### Virtualization – A Key Advantage of the Cloud\\n\\nCloud service providers differentiate themselves from the capabilities of individual servers and data centers through virtualization, which means adding an abstraction layer between hardware and applications. In turn, virtualization enables multiple workloads and operating systems to run on the same physical server. As such, virtualization facilitates the critical competitive advantages of the cloud, including scalability, maximizing resource utilization, and provisioning more workloads with lower operating expenses.\\n\\n**READ MORE:****[Top 250 Data Center Companies in the World](https://dgtlinfra.com/top-data-center-companies/)**\\n\\n**What are the 5 Benefits of Cloud Computing?**\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe 5 benefits of cloud computing are scalability, pay-per-use, speed & agility, outsourcing, and global reach:\\n\\n1.   **Scalability:** an enterprise’s internal IT systems may not be scalable to meet peak demand for workloads, unless they maintain excess capacity – _which is costly_. By using cloud computing, customers can instantly increase or decrease their hardware and software capacity needs to meet business requirements\\n2.   **Pay-Per-Use:** instead of investing [capital expenditures (CapEx)](https://dgtlinfra.com/cloud-hyperscale-capex/) in data centers and servers prior to knowing how they are going to be used, customers can pay only when they consume computing resources, and pay only for how much they consume\\n3.   **Speed and Agility:** new IT resources can be provisioned in a cloud computing environment with only a few clicks. Therefore, customers can reduce the time to make those resources available to developers from weeks to just minutes\\n4.   **Outsourcing:** cloud computing enables customers to avoid racking, stacking, and powering servers, in addition to eschewing the ongoing maintenance of their data centers\\n5.   **Global Reach:** applications can be deployed in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. In turn, this enables applications to have lower latency and provides a better experience for end users\\n\\nAt the same time, a significant number of enterprises are shifting to **hybrid** and **multi-cloud** environments to avoid vendor lock-in and to preserve the flexibility to host sensitive workloads in a more secure environment. Below are definitions of [hybrid cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/hybrid-cloud-computing/) and [multi-cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/multi-cloud-computing/):\\n\\n*   **Hybrid Cloud:** application deployments in a combination of different environments including on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud\\n*   **Multi-Cloud:** application deployments with several public cloud service providers, instead of only using a single public cloud service provider\\n\\n**Which Cloud Service Provider is Cheapest?**\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nTo answer the questions: Which is cheapest cloud provider? and How much do cloud computing services cost?, Dgtl Infra reviewed a [recent comparison by Linode](https://www.linode.com/), which studied the cost per month of a CPU Dedicated/Optimized 2vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD deployment. Below is a summary of the monthly costs for this deployment from the four largest public cloud service providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Alibaba Cloud:\\n\\n**#****Cloud Service Provider****Cost per Month****% Higher**\\n1 Alibaba Cloud$48.42—\\n2 Google Cloud Platform (GCP)$63.38 31%\\n3 Microsoft Azure$70.05 45%\\n4 Amazon Web Services (AWS)$71.47 48%\\n\\nAs shown in the example above, for the CPU Dedicated/Optimized 2vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB SSD deployment, **Alibaba Cloud was the cheapest** public cloud service provider at $48.42 per month. In contrast, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the most expensive** public cloud service provider, at a cost of $71.47 per month, 48% higher than Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\nAlthough the above analysis highlights the cheapest public cloud service provider among the **large** vendors, in reality the **smaller** cloud service providers, such as OVHcloud, DigitalOcean, and Linode are the most cost-effective. These companies are generally **at least** 20% to 35% cheaper across the board – _and often 50%+ cheaper_ – when compared to AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.\\n\\n[![Image 68](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)](https://eepurl.com/hndE5n)\\n\\n*   TAGS\\n*   [Amazon Web Services](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/amazon-web-services/)\\n*   [Cloud Computing](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/cloud-computing/)\\n*   [Data Centers](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/data-centers/)\\n*   [Google Cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/google-cloud/)\\n*   [Microsoft Azure](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/microsoft-azure/)\\n*   [Oracle Cloud](https://dgtlinfra.com/tag/oracle-cloud/)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdgtlinfra.com%2Ftop-cloud-service-providers%2F \\\"Facebook\\\")[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdgtlinfra.com%2Ftop-cloud-service-providers%2F&via=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdgtlinfra \\\"Twitter\\\")[WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024%20%0A%0A%20https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/ \\\"WhatsApp\\\")[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/&title=Top+10+Cloud+Service+Providers+Globally+in+2024 \\\"Linkedin\\\")[Email](mailto:?subject=Top%2010%20Cloud%20Service%20Providers%20Globally%20in%202024&body=https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/ \\\"Email\\\")\\n\\n[](https://dgtlinfra.com/top-cloud-service-providers/# \\\"More\\\")\\n\\n[![Image 70: Mary Zhang](blob:http://localhost/6fcdd002675ad5f0c4c308bbbda322e2)](https://dgtlinfra.com/author/marydgtlinfra/)\\n\\n[Mary Zhang](https://dgtlinfra.com/author/marydgtlinfra/)\\n\\nMary Zhang covers Data Centers for Dgtl Infra, including Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX), Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR), CyrusOne, CoreSite Realty, QTS Realty, Switch Inc, Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM), Cyxtera (NASDAQ: CYXT), and many more.

Quite the opposite! \\n\\nIn 2024, [Gartner forecasts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-29-gartner-says-cloud-will-become-a-business-necessity-by-2028) that the worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services will grow to $679 billion, following a major year for the cloud in 2023 where many organizations used cloud computing either as a technology disruptor or capability enabler. \\n\\nBut it’s not just this continued incline in adoption and utilization of the cloud that promises big things in the not-so-distant future. On the contrary, Gartner’s forecasts indicate that this is just the start of a major turning point in which cloud computing shifts from a technology disruptor to becoming a necessary component for maintaining business competitiveness. It’s for this reason that cloud spending is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2027, and complete its transition into a business necessity by 2028.  \\n\\nWith that in mind, what cloud computing trends can we expect to see in 2024? How will the cloud continue its growth from a convenient to a critical business tool? And what does this all mean for your cloud and wider business strategy?   \\n\\nLet’s find out.   \\n\\n \\n\\n## **5 cloud computing trends in 2024**\\n\\n## Unmissable insights into hiring AWS talent in 2024\\n\\n## Edge integration\\n\\nEdge computing is a cloud-related paradigm that processes data as close as possible to the place it was collected. In 2024, this looks set to loosen the cloud’s dominance as the sole computing environment, as businesses begin to look beyond centralized data centers in favor of a more diverse resource ecosystem.\\n\\nThat’s because edge computing is a growing trend in itself that will only continue to evolve for the next 12 months and beyond. You only need to look at the adoption of advanced 5G networks and the development of smaller, more powerful, memory-efficient processors and algorithms to see this.\\n\\nTake, for example, the real-time heart monitor features integrated into today’s smart watches. Rather than the device collecting that data, sending it to a healthcare cloud for analysis, and then back to the monitor, these devices can instead act as the edge servers and analyze the data locally, wasting less time and bandwidth in the process. As devices like these smart watches and phones begin to integrate more machine learning (ML) features in the coming year, we can expect ML models to run smoother and more cohesively on edge devices, with features such as [Amazon SageMaker Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/edge/) already making waves in this area.\\n\\nOf course, this isn’t about shifting away from the cloud. Instead, edge computing is more concerned with reducing reliance on the cloud by enabling organizations to capitalize on each data stream’s most cost-effective and efficient option. By unlocking more robust and localized control, we expect to see businesses leverage data more effectively and efficiently, no matter where it resides.\\n\\n## **Sustainability**\\n\\nIt’s hard to emphasize just how big of a role cloud computing can have in accelerating environmental initiatives. As the issue of global heating becomes more and more pressing with each passing year, we expect sustainability to be a top trend in the cloud space this year.\\n\\nThe numbers don’t lie. According to the [latest projections by McKinsley & Co](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/cloud-powered-technologies-for-sustainability), the cloud has considerable potential to enhance the sustainability transition by reducing the cost and time required to implement various decarbonization initiatives by 2-10%. Moreover, the same study found that these technologies can decrease up to 32 metric gigatons of CO2 equivalent by 2050, which is roughly half of what’s needed to reach net zero by 2050.\\n\\nWhile manufacturing and transportation stand to benefit the most from cloud-powered decarbonization solutions, we expect sustainability to take center stage industry-wide this year, with cloud providers continuing to invest heavily in green cloud technologies and advocate for more sustainable practices. And with [AWS pledging to achieve net zero by 2040](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/carbon-methodology.pdf), this focus will not only improve the sustainability of the cloud providers themselves, but will reduce the carbon footprint of their customers, too.\\n\\nAs organizations begin to take much-needed action in aligning their environmental practices with their internal values, customer and stakeholder expectations, and new legal requirements, the environmentally conscious cloud will prove a vital tool not just to socially responsible organizations, but to the planet as a whole.\\n\\n## **Models as a service**\\n\\nIt will come as little surprise to learn that the aforementioned ML integration isn’t the only time we’ll cover AI and ML in this article. After all, the mainstream emergence and rapid evolution of these solutions in the past couple of years has marked a hugely significant breakthrough in the next generation of technological adoption.\\n\\nWhat you might not be as aware of is the massive role the cloud has to play in this adoption.\\n\\nAI models like the ones powering ChatGPT require a whole lot – and we mean a whole lot – of data and resources, and these aren’t readily accessible to a lot of organizations. So, as businesses begin transitioning from proof-of-concept to production systems, new infrastructure will be required to support this shift.\\n\\nThe cloud therefore looks set to play a major part in democratizing AI by offering models-as-a-service to businesses. Fully managed services like [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html) are already proving highly effective in accelerating the adoption of GenAI and ML within organizations by enabling access to the social and economic benefits of these solutions without requiring large-scale infrastructure changes. What’s more, the cloud provides a preferred environment to train data with convenient provisioning and scaling capabilities.\\n\\nFor many businesses in 2024, specialized cloud models-as-a-service will likely prove the easiest and most effective path to GenAI and ML adoption.\\n\\n## **Multi-cloud optimization**\\n\\nAcross the professional landscape, there’s been an observable shift towards hybrid and multi-cloud use, and we expect to see organizations optimize their adoption of these environments this year.\\n\\nA one-size-fits-all approach to cloud solutions is becoming increasingly old news, with [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/10/09/the-10-biggest-cloud-computing-trends-in-2024-everyone-must-be-ready-for-now/) predicting that as many as 85% of large organizations will use a multi-cloud strategy this year.\\n\\nThat’s because with an increased demand for data storage, there has been an increase in the price of this too, which has led many IT leaders to reassess their cloud approach in favor of a more tailored and dynamic strategy that combines both public and private clouds, minimizing wasteful use of the cloud and, in turn, saving them money.\\n\\nOf course, the benefits of a multi-cloud strategy don’t end there. In addition to storage efficiency and cost effectiveness, a hybrid approach offers far greater flexibility when using a variety of tools—for example, using a different cloud that integrates with OpenAI rather than building an LLM in your existing cloud environment from scratch. By identifying the optimal cloud resource for specific workloads and combining with on-premises infrastructure when necessary, organizations have greater freedom in optimizing their strategies by leveraging vendor-agnostic solutions.\\n\\nThat’s not to say it’s all plain sailing. Hybrid-cloud strategies will come with their own hurdles and complexities, so be sure to consider how you will optimize aspects like cloud management and operations, data governance, and integration with legacy systems when using this approach.\\n\\n## **Security evolution**\\n\\nWith each passing year, the rise in cloud computing adoption and the evolution of cyber-crime capabilities means that cybersecurity risks are being amplified further. And with that comes the need for an evolution in cloud security.\\n\\nWith cloud security taking center stage in 2024, businesses need to recognize that it’s not solely the responsibility of cloud providers to ensure that private data is kept safe, and understand the important role they play in actively engaging in cybersecurity best practices. This includes staying well informed about the latest threats, educating employees on risks and mitigation, and regular vulnerability assessments.\\n\\nThis year, it’s more important than ever for cloud providers, partners, and their customers to be collaborative and promote transparency around security to successfully build trust and effectively foster a secure cloud ecosystem. We predict that this year, a secure cloud ecosystem will be dependent on five key areas:\\n\\n## Need AWS talent to execute your business plans in 2024?\\n\\nJefferson Frank  \\n10th Floor  \\n199 Water Street  \\nNew York City  \\nNY 10038  \\nUSA\\n\\n## Job seekers\\n\\n## Employers\\n\\n## Jefferson Frank\\n\\n## Connect\\n\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Partner.png)\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Activate.png)\\n\\n## Job seekers\\n\\n## Employers\\n\\n## Jefferson Frank\\n\\n## Connect\\n\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Partner.png)\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Activate.png)\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nJefferson Frank  \\n10th Floor  \\n199 Water Street  \\nNew York City  \\nNY 10038  \\nUSA\\n\\n## Job seekers\\n\\n## Employers\\n\\n## Jefferson Frank\\n\\n## Connect\\n\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Partner.png)\\n![](/insights/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AWS-Activate.png)\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nJefferson Frank  \\n10th Floor  \\n199 Water Street  \\nNew York City  \\nNY 10038  \\nUSA\\n\\n### © 2025 Jefferson Frank\"\n",
