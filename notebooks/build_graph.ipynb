Achieving this goal entails streamlining operations by ensuring data is readily available at every touchpoint. Cloud computing services facilitate business functionalities by providing access to information across all devices anytime and from anywhere. As businesses evolve to meet customers’ needs, the demand for cloud computing services is growing, and their reliability is improving. During the first quarter of 2020, cloud spending rose 37% to USD 29 billion. The increasing need for scalable, secure, dependable, and affordable resources off-premises is driving the demand for cloud computing services. Despite the expected economic slowdown due to the pandemic, cloud spending increased by 19% in 2020, even though IT spending will decline by 8%. According to recent data, corporate spending on cloud computing is growing at double-digit rates as chief information officers and other tech leaders choose cutting-edge features such as artificial intelligence that are more expensive than standard business apps. Due to the current macroeconomic conditions, cloud leaders are increasingly using cloud-based services (42%), planning to migrate from legacy software to cloud-based tools (33%), and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud (32%).\\n\\n#### Restraint: Lack of technical knowledge and expertise\\n\\nOrganizations require staff with technical skills and knowledge to implement, process, analyze, and secure cloud solutions. However, there is a severe scarcity of technical skills among IT workers, particularly in cloud computing. This lack of expertise is causing companies to miss out on the benefits of the cloud and emerging technologies, ultimately leading to a loss of market share and revenue. Companies struggle to find suitable candidates due to challenges, including rapid hiring processes, high wages for experienced cloud workers, and difficulty finding individuals who align with the organization’s culture. If the shortage of cloud workers continues, the company’s growth engines could sputter. Despite 80% of IT leaders recognizing that the lack of skilled workers prevents companies from expanding their modern software engineering and cloud environments, over 90% plan to achieve this goal.\\n\\n#### Opportunities: Adoption of IoT and connected devices\\n\\nThe technological landscape evolves with innovations added every day. Two of the closely related future internet technologies are IoT and cloud computing. IoT provides a foundation for cloud computing to succeed. IoT devices produce data that must be collected and processed locally or remotely on a server. In many IoT applications, remote data hosting and analytics are more practical and cost-effective solutions. As IoT and cloud computing continue to expand, there is also a growing interest in edge computing. Edge computing can help reduce the demand for cloud storage by pre-filtering data and sending only some of it to distant servers.Moreover, edge computing has enormous promise for real-time data analytics. In the future, it is likely to work in conjunction with IoT devices and cloud computing, providing an even better framework for the constantly growing data streams from massive IoT applications. However, moving all data processing and storage back to the edge is impractical for most businesses.\\n\\n#### Challenges: High complexity due to the adoption of multi-cloud model\\n\\nLean IT teams are facing new challenges in addressing their current difficulties. Businesses have traditionally focused on cost control, efficiency improvement, and process optimization. However, the pandemic has forced them to prioritize deployments, leading to a rush towards public cloud solutions without adequate due diligence; this has resulted in increased complexity, higher costs, and less flexibility, with little focus on achieving strategic business goals. According to a recent study, 87% of respondents agree that managing mixed-cloud infrastructures is essential for multi-cloud success. As multi-cloud deployments become more common, organizations face various challenges in managing cloud resources. Cloud computing operates at multiple levels, each with its best practices and deployment rules, making it difficult to use in multi-cloud scenarios. The complexity of managing cloud resources increases with each additional cloud environment used. The management burden also increases with the number of public cloud vendors used, as no industry standards exist. Therefore, it is crucial to review the security measures of each vendor and understand the breadth of their security measures before signing up for multi-cloud services.\\n\\n### Global cloud computing market Ecosystem Analysis\\n\\nBased on the deployment model, the hybrid cloud segment significantly contributes the highest CAGR to the cloud computing market during the forecast period. Hybrid cloud in cloud computing refers to an IT architecture incorporating some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across two or more environments, including on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds. The hybrid cloud model allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both private and public clouds, providing greater flexibility, scalability, and optimization of resources. A hybrid cloud will enable organizations to move applications and workloads between private and public clouds based on specific needs. This flexibility is valuable for managing varying demands and optimizing costs. A hybrid cloud provides the capability to have redundant and backup systems across different environments. In case of a failure or disaster in one location, workloads can be shifted to another environment, ensuring business continuity. A hybrid cloud allows organizations to optimize costs by choosing the most cost-effective platform for each workload. It also enables a pay-as-you-go model for resources consumed from public clouds.\\n\\n![](/Images/cloud-computing-market-Ecosystem.webp)\\n\\n#### Based on the vertical, the BFSI segment holds a significant cloud computing market share during the forecast period.\\n\\nPayment gateways, online fund transfers, digital wallets, and unified customers play a significant role in the BFSI industry, facilitating the transition to cloud deployment. BFSI companies have started using Infinity Distribution Services, a suite of cloud-based banking distribution services launched by Switzerland-based company Temenos. The company leverages AI to modernize its legacy systems into digital platforms. These platforms would enable banks to offer digital onboarding services, fund authorization, marketing, and other services that banks of any size can deploy in any pandemic. Additionally, MACIF Group, a French mutual insurance provider, has deployed Microsoft’s G Suite for over 8,000 employees to ensure business continuity. This deployment has allowed employees to shift from in-person to more than 1,300 Google Meet video meetings daily. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting- Cloud-based compliance solutions help banks manage and maintain compliance with complex and ever-changing regulatory requirements. These solutions automate compliance tasks, provide real-time reporting, and ensure adherence to data privacy regulations. Mobile Payments and Transfers- Cloud-based solutions facilitate secure and convenient mobile payments, money transfers, and bill payments, enabling customers to manage their finances seamlessly from their smartphones or tablets.\\n\\n### ASIA PACIFIC Region Holds the Largest Share of the cloud computing market.\\n\\nThe adoption of advanced technologies, such as IoT and AI, edge computing, and 5G across verticals will drive the growth of the cloud computing market in the Asia Pacific.

Early indications, in fact, show that Africa is moving quickly onto cloud, and there are no signs of slowing down.\\n\\nIn a recent McKinsey survey of technology leaders at more than 50 major African businesses, the participants reported having, on average, about 45 percent of their workloads in public cloud today. Although based on a relatively small sample size, thatâs on par or ahead of the rates of adoption in North America and China.\\n\\nThe history of mobile adoption on the African continent provides an intriguing reference point. The population of sub-Saharan Africa in 2000, for example, was 90 percent less likely to have access to a fixed telephone than people in East Asia or Latin America. But they had urgent and important needs, such as voice connectivity and eventually mobile banking, which led to a rapid adoption of mobile. By 2020, the region had more than half a billion unique mobile subscribers, making Africa the fastest-growing area for mobile technology.[1âLeapfrogging,â Institute for Security Studies (ISS) African Futures, October 27, 2023; and Francois Botha, âWhy Africa has the ability to leapfrog the rest of the world with innovation,â *Forbes,*April 2, 2019.](javascript:void(0);) Similar dynamicsâlimited legacy infrastructure and innovative technology advancesâare in place when it comes to cloud, providing African businesses with another opportunity to leapfrog ahead.\\n\\nAfrican companies that can make the leap stand to gain a sizable prize. Recent McKinsey research projected a [global cloud value of $3 trillion](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/projecting-the-global-value-of-cloud-3-trillion-is-up-for-grabs-for-companies-that-go-beyond-adoption), with $797 billion of this value sitting in Africa and Europe across what weâve categorized as the Rejuvenate dimension (IT cost efficiencies) and the Innovate dimension (revenue uplifts and business operations savings).[2â[Projecting the global value of cloud: $3 trillion is up for grabs for companies that go beyond adoption](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/projecting-the-global-value-of-cloud-3-trillion-is-up-for-grabs-for-companies-that-go-beyond-adoption),â McKinsey, November 28, 2022. The analysis did not differentiate between Africa and Europe when it comes to cloudâs value potential. While much of the value potential lies in Europe, a significant amount is available for Africa.](javascript:void(0);) Many of Africaâs businesses are in sectors where cloud can have a significant impact, such as banking, telecommunications, and oil and gas.\\n\\nChallenges abound, however, in capturing this value. Wide variations in language, culture, and currency exist, and generally lower market maturity levels, differing regulatory environments, limited infrastructure, and a shortage of colocation data centers[3For example, AWS has one region in Africa (Cape Town), Azure has one (Johannesburg), and Google Cloud does not yet have any.](javascript:void(0);) hamper cloud programs. And despite lower income levels than other countries, cloud service providers (CSPs) in Africa sometimes cost more on average for the same services than they do in other regions around the world.[4Example using AWS Pricing Calculator for cloud services in Cape Town versus other regions.](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\n## About the research\\n\\nIn 2022 and 2023, we surveyed 53 tech executives working in businesses in the following sectors: financial services; consumer packaged goods; telecommunications, media, and technology; and global energy and minerals. We also had detailed discussions with another dozen executives. These leaders spanned most African regions[1As defined by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).](javascript:void(0);) (except Central Africa) and were directly involved in their organizationsâ key technology decisions, as C-suite members, vice presidents, or IT directors. Company sizes ranged up to (and a few over) $1 billion a year in revenues, with more than half of participants coming from lower-revenue companies (less than $50 million a year).\\n\\nExecutives were asked a variety of questions about their cloud footprint today, migration strategies, advantages and obstacles encountered in cloud adoption, and their future plans for cloud.\\n\\nThe survey and analysis were not intended to create a holistic view of the market but rather to generate indicative insights into cloud trends in Africa.\\n\\nTo better understand the current state of cloud adoption in the region and more precisely identify the use cases and challenges facing African countries, we surveyed more than 50 technology executives across four primary sectorsin Africa and conducted detailed interviews with more than a dozen others (see sidebar, âAbout the researchâ).\\n\\n## Cloud adoption in the African market today\\n\\nOf the African executives we surveyed and spoke to, most have transitioned at least some workloads to a cloud environment. Almost a fifth of these companies have all workloads in some sort of cloud environment, with most workloads in public cloudâinfrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS)âand others in private cloud (dedicated and on-premises) (Exhibit 1). Cloud expenditure across organizations interviewed was sizable, accounting for an average of 38 percent of total IT expenditure, compared to projected global cloud spend of about 50 percent of IT expenditure by 2025.[5âGartner says more than half of enterprise IT spending in key market segments will switch to the cloud by 2025,â Gartner press release, February 9, 2022.](javascript:void(0);) This trend was particularly evident among smaller organizations, where the ratio of cloud-to-IT spend was higher on average.\\n\\n![Only 17 percent of respondents are fully on cloud.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex1-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nThese numbers compare favorably with adoption rates seen in similar surveys in other regions. Recent Cloud by McKinsey research in North America, based on interviews with roughly 30 major companies using cloud, found that the public-cloud adoption rate was on average around 40 percent. [In China, a Cloud by McKinsey survey](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/cloud-in-china-the-outlook-for-2025) of 278 decision makers found that the average percent of workloads hosted in public cloud was around 30 percent.[6Kai Shen, Anand Swaminathan, Xiaoxiao Tong, and Kevin Wei Wang, â[Cloud in China: The outlook for 2025](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/cloud-in-china-the-outlook-for-2025),â McKinsey, July 8, 2022.](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\nRespondents cited key Africa-specific issuesâsuch as critical infrastructure challenges, power needs (load shedding, for example), and local supply chain shortages of on-premises hardwareâas drivers of adoption. A limited history of building up legacy systems and incurring [technical debt](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/breaking-technical-debts-vicious-cycle-to-modernize-your-business) that can complicate migrations is likely another contributing factor.\\n\\nDigging beneath the surface of the overall adoption rates, we found that only a small percentage of the respondents (26 percent) were in the âexperimental phase,â with less than 50 percent of workloads in cloud (public or private). The majority have already deployed cloud technology to multiple or all business units. Compute and storage make up the majority of cloud services used (29 percent and 32 percent, respectively).\\n\\nLeading organizations are now actively using [the benefits of cloud technology](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/three-actions-ceos-can-take-to-get-value-from-cloud-computing)âscalability, support elasticity, services, and operational efficienciesâto support use cases such as creating end-to-end digital journeys, building new products, and running customer analytics. One African financial institution, for example, recently launched a new digital bank completely on public cloud, which allows it to scale the bankâs compute and storage capacity as more customers are onboarded.\\n\\n### Would you like to learn more about [Cloud by McKinsey](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/cloud/overview)?\\n\\n## Regional consistency, sector variation\\n\\nCloud adoption among respondents is fairly consistent across African regions,[7As defined by United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). Research was not able to include organizations in Middle Africa.](javascript:void(0);) with the highest levels, 70 to 77 percent, in East Africa, West Africa, and Southern Africa (Exhibit 2). In terms of public cloud, participants from Southern Africa reported the highest usage of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS (50 percent), followed by West Africa (46 percent) and East Africa (44 percent). Even organizations in other regions with lower cloud presence (such as North Africa), however, reported plans to shift workloads and catch up in the near future.\\n\\n![Respondents in North Africa had a higher percentage of workloads on-premises compared to those in other African regions.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex2-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nThe findings are indicative of more pronounced differences in adoption rates by sector, where adoption and specific service needs varied depending on the use cases. Participants from technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) had the highest overall average adoption rate, at 83 percent, primarily in public cloud (Exhibit 3).\\n\\n![TMT respondents appear to be leading adoption, with 61 percent of workloads hosted on public cloud.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex3-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nTMT participants also had the highest proportion of compute services being used in cloud (compared to other servicesâdatabase, network, storage), suggesting that their heavy cloud adoption is correlated with computationally and analytically intensive use cases (Exhibit 4).\\n\\n![Respondents' usage of cloud services varies widely across industries with differing use cases.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-ex4.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nFinancial services organizations had the lowest rates of cloud adoption, at an average of 56 percent of workload (39 percent in public cloud, 17 percent in private cloud), likely due in part to regulatory restrictions. Similarly, the kinds of cloud services used also varied. Although global energy and materials as well as consumer packaged goods respondents were in the middle of the pack in terms of adoption, for example, they both had high rates of using storage services (about 40 percent of their total cloud services usage). Location of data storage is often scrutinized, and industries facing fewer regulations may have more flexibility.\\n\\nAll industries surveyed seemed to find industry-specific use cases that benefited from cloud, and most planned to grow their cloud presence in the near future. One financial services company, for example, has begun using automation and generative AI to reduce the human interaction required to service clients and to provide recommendations to sales staff and instant support help to customers. As its on-premises infrastructure could not keep up with the rapid growth in its compute and data storage needs, it turned to public cloud for these functions. The IT organization at a telecom provider is in the process of migrating 40 percent of its on-premises IT applications to public cloud over the next three years to better manage spikes in demand across geographies.\\n\\n## Cloud adoption approaches\\n\\nExamining cloud adoption approaches, we found survey participants migrated 50 percent of applications, on average, to rehost workloads, which is a similar rate to interviewed North American companies (Exhibit 5). While rehosting is typically the quickest and cheapest way to migrate an application to cloud, many participants found that this limited their companyâs ability to leverage many of cloudâs benefits.\\n\\n![Migration approach of African respondents closely resembles that of North American respondents in similar research effort.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex5-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nIn contrast, the most common migration focus (about 40 percent) for surveyed companies in Southern Africa and in the TMT industry is refactoring or rearchitecting applications, which has allowed them to take better advantage of improved scalability, speed, agility, and security offered by cloud, and better modernize their operating model in parallel. Organizations in other regions and industries report plans to begin refactoring or rearchitecting a greater proportion of their migrated applications as they reach higher maturity levels.\\n\\nAfrican companies we surveyed clearly favored public over private cloud (in contrast, [companies in China favor private-cloud options](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/cloud-in-china-the-outlook-for-2025)). On average, participants we spoke to had 45 percent of workloads in public cloud (including about 20 percent in SaaS), with another 23 percent in private cloud. The reason for this discrepancy is likely that organizations struggle to stand up private cloud at scale, especially given Africaâs infrastructure and supply chain limitations, compared to the quick access and breadth of services offered by public cloud.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no strong trend among African participants in terms of the number of cloud service providers they used. Half of the respondents, for example, used only one CSP (compared to 87 percent of companies in North America and [76 percent in China](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/cloud-in-china-the-outlook-for-2025)). This trend is likely due to the smaller presence of CSPs in Africa, as well as regulatory and data sovereignty constraints.[8CloudSights database 2022â23, Cloud by McKinsey.](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\n![cloud concept - ai generated image](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/in%20search%20of%20cloud%20value%20can%20generative%20ai%20transform%20cloud%20roi/mckinseytech-cloud%20campaign-1536x1536-notext.png?cq=50&mh=145&car=16:9&cpy=Center)\\n\\n### In search of cloud value: Can generative AI transform cloud ROI?\\n\\n## Strong indicators for increased cloud adoption in Africa\\n\\nWhile preferences for future cloud adoption are not necessarily predictive, they are useful indicators of companiesâ priorities. All respondents felt confident that their organizations would expand their cloud presence in some way over the next one to three years, with participants from financial services predicting the highest rate of increase in public- and private-cloud growth on average, at 26 percentage points (Exhibit 6). However, a few participants, particularly within the global energy and materials industry, predicted more growth in private cloud than public. The majority of respondents (about 60 percent) also believed that most companies in Africa will adopt cloud broadly across their business in the future.\\n\\n![All respondents predicted growth in some mix of private- and public-cloud workloads.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex6-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nThe vast majority of participants said they plan on using cloud for new-application development. Half of them plan on taking a cloud-native approach for all new applications, while the rest cited application criticality, regulatory requirements, latency requirements, and skills availability as dependent factors.\\n\\nCSPs are noticing this potential. There have been significant investments from global and local cloud providers, for example, in building out African cloud offerings, as well as recent investments in African infrastructure that will support cloud technology, such as fiber-optic cables and broadband infrastructure.[9Vaughan OâGrady, âIFC invests to support Seacomâs expansion,â Developing Telecoms, May 4, 2022.](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\n## Challenges faced by African organizations in the cloud\\n\\nIn line with international trends, many organizations in Africa have struggled to realize the full set of benefits they hoped to see from cloud despite progress in increasing cost predictability and adding new products and services (Exhibit 7). The lag in value realization suggests that the cloud adoption journey for African companies has proven to be more complex than anticipated.\\n\\n![Majority of expected cloud benefits are not being fully realized.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-exhibits-ex7-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nWhile many of the challenges are the same as those faced by their counterparts in other regionsâsuch as [managing costs](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-finops-way-how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-to-realizing-clouds-value), [security](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/security-as-code-the-best-and-maybe-only-path-to-securing-cloud-applications-and-systems), and [operating model](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/building-a-cloud-ready-operating-model-for-agility-and-resiliency)âa few of them are more pronounced in Africa. Legal and regulatory constraints were by far the most-cited challenge, with over 50 percent of respondents casting them as significant roadblocks (Exhibit 8). Only 10 percent of respondents said that the legal and policy requirements currently in place support cloud adoption.\\n\\n![Legal and regulatory constraints and multicloud complexities are seen as the two biggest barriers to cloud adoption. ](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/africas%20leap%20ahead%20into%20cloud%20opportunities%20and%20barriers/svgz-africas-leap-into-cloud-ex8.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)\\n\\nData residency laws, for example, such as articles included in Algeriaâs, Gabonâs, Nigerâs, and Moroccoâs data protection laws, are common across Africa and require regulated data (such as personal information) to be localized within the countryâs borders.[10âWhich way for data localization in Africa?â Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), November 2022.](javascript:void(0);) Given the limited data center presence of cloud providers in Africa, this regulation essentially makes it impossible for many organizations to use public cloud for these data sets.\\n\\nOther countries in Africa (for example, Kenya, South Africa, Tunisia, and Uganda) also have restrictions against cross-border data transfer.[11âWhich way for data localization in Africa?â Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), November 2022.](javascript:void(0);) Cross-border data transfer is a critical cloud use case for most multinational companies, with financial services organizations likely to be particularly affected. In the future, regulatory bodies, organizations, and service providers will need to collaborate to establish policies and frameworks that address legal and regulatory concerns while encouraging cloud adoption and innovation rather than prohibiting it.\\n\\nThe ability to attract and retain the required cloud talent is another challenge with unique complexities on the Africa continent. Some 97 percent of African organizations expect to have a tech skills challenge in 2023, with attracting skilled new recruits as their number one complaint.[12*Africaâs tech skills scarcity revealed*, SAP Africa, March 3, 2023.](javascript:void(0);) Furthermore, those companies that have had success in attracting talent have trouble keeping them in the face of strong incentives to move to a higher-paying region (or find remote work).\\n\\nThese issues are forcing African organizations to reconsider their sourcing models for highly skilled IT talent and to create better attraction and incentive strategies. One area of focus is establishing strong partnerships with system integrators and CSPs to get support on their cloud migration while simultaneously upskilling existing teams.\\n\\nWhile the results of our survey indicate that companies in Africa seem to be following global trends toward increased cloud adoption, they still have a significant journey ahead of them. An increased focus on addressing local issues, coupled with a more cloud-friendly environment, are promising signs that companies in Africa are expanding their opportunities to capture a greater share of cloudâs significant potential value.\\n\\n##### \\n\\n**[Sven Blumberg](/our-people/sven-blumberg)** is a senior partner in McKinsey’s Düsseldorf office, **Jean-Claude Gelle** is a partner in the Johannesburg office, and **Isabelle Tamburro** is a consultant in the Chicago office (previously in the Casablanca office).\\n\\nThe authors wish to thank Tzu Heng Huang, Jean Louw, Thomas Mbashu, and Prian Naicker for their contributions to this article.\\n\\n##### Explore a career with us\\n\\n##### Related Articles\\n\\n![Cloud computing - stock photo](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/projecting%20the%20global%20value%20of%20cloud%203%20trillion%20go%20beyond%20adoption/thumb-gettyimages-630022096.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&car=16:9&cpy=Center)\\n\\n###### [Projecting the global value of cloud: $3 trillion is up for grabs for companies that go beyond adoption](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/projecting-the-global-value-of-cloud-3-trillion-is-up-for-grabs-for-companies-that-go-beyond-adoption)\\n\\n![A business man looking up at a fluffy white cloud with digital lines radiating from it.](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/getting%20ahead%20in%20the%20cloud/getting-ahead-in-the-cloud-1223477764-thumb-1536x1536.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&car=16:9&cpy=Center)\\n\\n###### [Getting ahead in the cloud](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/getting-ahead-in-the-cloud)\\n\\n![Cloud Computing Technology - stock photo](/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/five%20learnings%20from%20ctos%20and%20tech%20leaders%20on%20their%20cloud%20strategies/thumb-gettyimages-1260460234.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&car=16:9&cpy=Center)\\n\\n###### [Five learnings from CTOs and tech leaders on their cloud strategies](/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/five-learnings-from-ctos-and-tech-leaders-on-their-cloud-strategies)\"\n",

Achieving this goal entails streamlining operations by ensuring data is readily available at every touchpoint. Cloud computing services facilitate business functionalities by providing access to information across all devices anytime and from anywhere. As businesses evolve to meet customers’ needs, the demand for cloud computing services is growing, and their reliability is improving. During the first quarter of 2020, cloud spending rose 37% to USD 29 billion. The increasing need for scalable, secure, dependable, and affordable resources off-premises is driving the demand for cloud computing services. Despite the expected economic slowdown due to the pandemic, cloud spending increased by 19% in 2020, even though IT spending will decline by 8%. According to recent data, corporate spending on cloud computing is growing at double-digit rates as chief information officers and other tech leaders choose cutting-edge features such as artificial intelligence that are more expensive than standard business apps. Due to the current macroeconomic conditions, cloud leaders are increasingly using cloud-based services (42%), planning to migrate from legacy software to cloud-based tools (33%), and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud (32%).\\n\\n#### Restraint: Lack of technical knowledge and expertise\\n\\nOrganizations require staff with technical skills and knowledge to implement, process, analyze, and secure cloud solutions. However, there is a severe scarcity of technical skills among IT workers, particularly in cloud computing. This lack of expertise is causing companies to miss out on the benefits of the cloud and emerging technologies, ultimately leading to a loss of market share and revenue. Companies struggle to find suitable candidates due to challenges, including rapid hiring processes, high wages for experienced cloud workers, and difficulty finding individuals who align with the organization’s culture. If the shortage of cloud workers continues, the company’s growth engines could sputter. Despite 80% of IT leaders recognizing that the lack of skilled workers prevents companies from expanding their modern software engineering and cloud environments, over 90% plan to achieve this goal.\\n\\n#### Opportunities: Adoption of IoT and connected devices\\n\\nThe technological landscape evolves with innovations added every day. Two of the closely related future internet technologies are IoT and cloud computing. IoT provides a foundation for cloud computing to succeed. IoT devices produce data that must be collected and processed locally or remotely on a server. In many IoT applications, remote data hosting and analytics are more practical and cost-effective solutions. As IoT and cloud computing continue to expand, there is also a growing interest in edge computing. Edge computing can help reduce the demand for cloud storage by pre-filtering data and sending only some of it to distant servers.Moreover, edge computing has enormous promise for real-time data analytics. In the future, it is likely to work in conjunction with IoT devices and cloud computing, providing an even better framework for the constantly growing data streams from massive IoT applications. However, moving all data processing and storage back to the edge is impractical for most businesses.\\n\\n#### Challenges: High complexity due to the adoption of multi-cloud model\\n\\nLean IT teams are facing new challenges in addressing their current difficulties. Businesses have traditionally focused on cost control, efficiency improvement, and process optimization. However, the pandemic has forced them to prioritize deployments, leading to a rush towards public cloud solutions without adequate due diligence; this has resulted in increased complexity, higher costs, and less flexibility, with little focus on achieving strategic business goals. According to a recent study, 87% of respondents agree that managing mixed-cloud infrastructures is essential for multi-cloud success. As multi-cloud deployments become more common, organizations face various challenges in managing cloud resources. Cloud computing operates at multiple levels, each with its best practices and deployment rules, making it difficult to use in multi-cloud scenarios. The complexity of managing cloud resources increases with each additional cloud environment used. The management burden also increases with the number of public cloud vendors used, as no industry standards exist. Therefore, it is crucial to review the security measures of each vendor and understand the breadth of their security measures before signing up for multi-cloud services.\\n\\n### Global cloud computing market Ecosystem Analysis\\n\\nBased on the deployment model, the hybrid cloud segment significantly contributes the highest CAGR to the cloud computing market during the forecast period. Hybrid cloud in cloud computing refers to an IT architecture incorporating some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across two or more environments, including on-premises data centers, private clouds, and public clouds. The hybrid cloud model allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both private and public clouds, providing greater flexibility, scalability, and optimization of resources. A hybrid cloud will enable organizations to move applications and workloads between private and public clouds based on specific needs. This flexibility is valuable for managing varying demands and optimizing costs. A hybrid cloud provides the capability to have redundant and backup systems across different environments. In case of a failure or disaster in one location, workloads can be shifted to another environment, ensuring business continuity. A hybrid cloud allows organizations to optimize costs by choosing the most cost-effective platform for each workload. It also enables a pay-as-you-go model for resources consumed from public clouds.\\n\\n![](/Images/cloud-computing-market-Ecosystem.webp)\\n\\n#### Based on the vertical, the BFSI segment holds a significant cloud computing market share during the forecast period.\\n\\nPayment gateways, online fund transfers, digital wallets, and unified customers play a significant role in the BFSI industry, facilitating the transition to cloud deployment.

The cloud computing report explores the thinking of 753 IT professionals and executive leaders from a survey conducted in late Q4 2023 and highlights the year-over-year (YoY) changes to help identify trends. The respondents—global cloud decision makers and users—revealed their experiences with cloud migration, cloud computing and their thoughts about the public, private and multi-cloud market.\\n\\nSelect highlights of the report on cloud computing are included below.\\n\\nTerminology used:\\n\\n## Managing cloud spending remains the top challenge over security\\n\\nThis marks the second year in a row that managing cloud spending is the top challenge facing organizations. As in previous years, there needs to be more resources/expertise. More than a quarter of respondents spend over $12 million a year on cloud (29%), and nearly a quarter (22%) spend that much on SaaS.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-1.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-1.png)\\n\\n## Organizations are embracing multi-cloud\\n\\nRespondents saw a slight increase in multi-cloud usage, up from 87% last year to 89% this year.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-2.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-2.png)\\n\\n## Enterprises turn to multi-cloud FinOps and security tools\\n\\nSixty-one percent of large enterprises use multi-cloud security, and 57% use multi-cloud FinOps (cost optimization) tools.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-3.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-3.png)\\n\\n## Siloed apps and disaster recovery (DR)/failover are the top multi-cloud implementations\\n\\nThe top two multi-cloud implementations are: apps siloed on different clouds, DR/failover between clouds. Apps siloed on different clouds increased the most (up to 57% from 44% YoY). Data integration between clouds increased to 45% from 37% YoY as organizations looked for the best fit for applications and data analysis.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-4.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-4.png)\\n\\n## AWS and Azure still lead overall\\n\\nAdoption grew for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Forty-nine percent of respondents reported using AWS for significant workloads, while 45% reported using Azure and 21% reported using Google Cloud Platform. In contrast, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, IBM and Alibaba Cloud usage is substantially lower and relatively unchanged compared to the previous year.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-5.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-5.png)\\n\\n## Cloud faces headwinds with small and medium-sized businesses\\n\\nSMBs are the highest cloud adopters, but fell off slightly from the previous year, with 61% (a drop from 67% last year) of workloads and 60% of data in the public cloud for both years.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-13-at-7.25.35 PM.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-13-at-7.25.35 PM.png)\\n\\n## There are big plans for AI\\n\\nNearly all platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings saw a gain in usage, with the most prominent being in the data warehouse (up to 65% from 56% YoY). Container-as-a-service (52%) and serverless (function-as-a-service) (48%) are both up nine percentage points this year. Machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) had a modest gain at 41%, up from 36% last year. However, ML/AI is the PaaS offering getting the most attention from companies experimenting (32%) or planning to use it (17%).\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-6.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-6.png)\\n\\n## Sustainability trails cost optimization\\n\\nForty-eight percent of respondents say they already have defined sustainability initiatives that include tracking the carbon footprint of cloud usage. When asked how sustainability compares to cost optimization, 59% prioritized cost optimization, though an additional 29% say that both cloud cost optimization and sustainability are equally prioritized.\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-7.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.flexera.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24-SOTC-Blog-7.png)\\n\\n## Don’t let economic volatility slow innovation\\n\\nThe world has experienced extraordinary disruption in the past few years, and while organizations of all sizes are prioritizing every dollar of spend, the cloud and technology will weather economic storms. Enterprises that remain focused on digital transformation, seizing new opportunities and evolving strategic initiatives through a cost-conscious lens will be better positioned for success than their competitors.\\n\\nGet the latest insights in cloud computing trends and cloud migration statistics by [viewing the complete survey results here.](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud)\\n\\nYou can also measure your own progress. Take our [Cloud Maturity Assessment](https://www.flexera.com/more/cloud-maturity-assessment?id=blog) to gain invaluable insights into your cloud infrastructure, operations, and governance.

This will be driven by factors such as a growing need to adopt new platforms and as-a-service offerings, including artificial intelligence (AI) services.\\n\\nThis is because, in 2024, businesses are looking beyond the time-and-money-saving opportunities of cloud migration. Emerging use cases across all industries make it clear that it can often be the key to becoming more innovative, agile and successful.\\n\\nFor many businesses, there will still be significant challenges – often revolving around security and data protection issues. However, new models that seek to offer best-of-all-worlds solutions, like hybrid cloud and federated cloud systems, will continue to break down barriers.\\n\\nPROMOTED\\n\\nIn 2024, cloud will continue to be a dynamic and exciting driver of innovation and opportunity. Here’s my overview of what will be the most significant trends in this field.\\n\\n**AI As-A-Service**\\n-------------------\\n\\nCloud infrastructure has a big role to play in making AI available to the masses, along with all the economic and social benefits that it’s expected to generate. AI models, such as the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT, are trained on huge amounts of data, using vast amounts of compute power. Most businesses don’t have the resources to do this themselves, but by accessing AI-as-a-service through cloud platforms, they are able to leverage this powerful, transformative technology.\\n\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\n[![Image 2: Graphic Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1290x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty_1-best-online-savings-thumbnail_101920pm.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\\n\\n### [Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \\\"Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\\\")\\n\\nBy [Kevin Payne,](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/) Contributor\\n\\n[![Image 3: Graphic Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/900x510/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Saving-Rates-2.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\\n\\n### [Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \\\"Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\\\")\\n\\nBy [Cassidy Horton,](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton) Contributor\\n\\n**Hybrid And Multi-Cloud**\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe number of large organizations with a multi-cloud strategy (i.e., they buy cloud services from more than one provider) is predicted to rise from 76% to 85% during 2024. It offers cost and flexibility advantages but adds complexity to data governance and integration with legacy systems. Multi and hybrid cloud (mixing cloud with on-premises infrastructure) are advanced infrastructure solutions that will continue to grow in popularity as organizations seek to balance security with flexibility and pick and choose the services they need.\\n\\n**Real-Time Cloud Infrastructure**\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring 2024, organizations will increasingly look to leverage real-time data in order to get up-to-the-minute insights rather than acting on outdated, stale information. At the same time, more and more of the data we consume will come in the form of streamed data – movies and music from Netflix and Spotify, video data from Zoom or Teams calls, and new forms of streamed entertainment such as cloud gaming. This means data storage that prioritizes instant access, such as Flash and solid-state storage devices, will become increasingly in demand by cloud customers.\\n\\n**Cloud-Driven Innovation And Transformation**\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs well as AI mentioned above, adopting cloud computing technology can be a gateway to many other transformative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and quantum computing. By eliminating the need to invest directly in architecture and infrastructure, businesses are able to launch quick-win/fail-fast initiatives to evaluate the benefits of emerging technologies more easily than ever in 2024, thanks to cloud computing.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Cloud Security And Resilience**\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nEncryption, authentication and disaster recovery are three functions of cloud computing services that will be increasingly in demand as we face up to the evolving threat landscape of 2024. Data thefts and breaches are increasing in frequency and severity as hackers develop new AI-powered forms of attack, and any system that has to be accessible to a human is always going to be at risk from social engineering attacks. This means security and resilience are high on the agenda of all cloud providers and customers.\\n\\n**Sustainable Cloud Computing**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe big cloud service providers have all made net-zero commitments, not just for their own operations but in order to help customers who use their services to reduce their carbon footprints. Amazon has pledged to achieve zero emissions by 2040, and Microsoft aims to beat this by ten years. Along with Google, they have also all stated their intention to generate 100 percent of the energy used in their operations from renewable sources. Whether they make it remains to be seen, but the push for greener and less environmentally impactful cloud computing will be a strong trend in 2024.\\n\\n**Simplified Cloud Computing**\\n------------------------------\\n\\nToday, low-code/ no-code tools are opening up the possibility for non-technical people to create applications that previously would have required trained software engineers. Likewise, cloud providers are leveraging drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language tools to eliminate the need for advanced technical skills and “democratize” the deployment and management of cloud services and infrastructure.\\n\\n**Privacy In The Cloud**\\n------------------------\\n\\nCloud privacy refers to the ongoing development of technological, regulatory and legislative solutions designed to help businesses leverage cloud while ensuring their customers can trust that their data is fully protected. When a business uses a cloud service, it generally involves passing data to a third party – usually the cloud service provider. Managing the privacy implications of this will continue to be an important theme in cloud computing during 2024.\\n\\n**Serverless And Pay-As-You-Go Cloud**\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nServerless is a model of cloud computing service that eliminates the need for businesses to manage their own servers. While a typical cloud service might charge the business for the number of servers that they want to host their infrastructure on, under a serverless model, the business simply pays for the resources they directly use. This drives efficiency by eliminating the need to pay for servers even when they are not in use and frees up the business's time to spend on their core activities.\\n\\n**Edge Computing Everywhere**\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nEdge computing is a cloud-related paradigm in which information is processed as close as possible to the location where it’s collected. An example might be a wearable real-time heart monitor designed to pick up arrhythmias. As most of the data it collects would be “normal” heart rhythms, sending it all to the cloud for analysis, then back to the user to tell them everything is fine, would be a waste of bandwidth. Analyzing the data on the device itself eliminates this cost and also means the user can be alerted more quickly if anomalous data is detected. In 2024, smaller, more power-efficient processors, more memory-efficient algorithms, and advanced networks like 5G all contribute to making edge increasingly viable for a growing number of applications.\\n\\nYou can read more about future tech and business trends in my books_,_ [_The Future Internet: How the Metaverse, Web 3.0, and Blockchain Will Transform Business and Society_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Internet-Metaverse-Blockchain-Transform/dp/1119882877?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=wwwwapinstitu-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d9690561c9d20b8efda1b6fc9bd2963a&camp=1634&creative=6738 \\\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Internet-Metaverse-Blockchain-Transform/dp/1119882877?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=wwwwapinstitu-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d9690561c9d20b8efda1b6fc9bd2963a&camp=1634&creative=6738\\\"), [_Future Skills: The 20 Skills And Competencies Everyone Needs To Succeed In A Digital World_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Skills-Competencies-Succeed-Digital/dp/1119870402/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=c1if8&content-id=amzn1.sym.3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_p=3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_r=258-7709474-6614411&pd_rd_wg=6RpOB&pd_rd_r=6446b85f-d863-48b3-bbc4-a6ceb0a2773b&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk \\\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Skills-Competencies-Succeed-Digital/dp/1119870402/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=c1if8&content-id=amzn1.sym.3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_p=3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_r=258-7709474-6614411&pd_rd_wg=6RpOB&pd_rd_r=6446b85f-d863-48b3-bbc4-a6ceb0a2773b&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk\\\") and [_Business Trends in Practice_](https://bernardmarr.com/books/ \\\"https://bernardmarr.com/books/\\\"), which won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.

      "    \"content\": \"The number of large organizations with a multi-cloud strategy (i.e., they buy cloud services from more than one provider) is predicted to rise from 76% to 85% during 2024. It offers cost and flexibility advantages but adds complexity to data governance and integration with legacy systems. Multi and hybrid cloud (mixing cloud with on-premises infrastructure) are advanced infrastructure solutions that will continue to grow in popularity as organizations seek to balance security with flexibility [...] For many businesses, there will still be significant challenges – often revolving around security and data protection issues. However, new models that seek to offer best-of-all-worlds solutions, like hybrid cloud and federated cloud systems, will continue to break down barriers.\\n\\nPROMOTED\\n\\nIn 2024, cloud will continue to be a dynamic and exciting driver of innovation and opportunity. Here’s my overview of what will be the most significant trends in this field. [...] Encryption, authentication and disaster recovery are three functions of cloud computing services that will be increasingly in demand as we face up to the evolving threat landscape of 2024. Data thefts and breaches are increasing in frequency and severity as hackers develop new AI-powered forms of attack, and any system that has to be accessible to a human is always going to be at risk from social engineering attacks. This means security and resilience are high on the agenda of all cloud\",\n",

This will be driven by factors such as a growing need to adopt new platforms and as-a-service offerings, including artificial intelligence (AI) services.\\n\\nThis is because, in 2024, businesses are looking beyond the time-and-money-saving opportunities of cloud migration. Emerging use cases across all industries make it clear that it can often be the key to becoming more innovative, agile and successful.\\n\\nFor many businesses, there will still be significant challenges – often revolving around security and data protection issues. However, new models that seek to offer best-of-all-worlds solutions, like hybrid cloud and federated cloud systems, will continue to break down barriers.\\n\\nPROMOTED\\n\\nIn 2024, cloud will continue to be a dynamic and exciting driver of innovation and opportunity. Here’s my overview of what will be the most significant trends in this field.\\n\\n**AI As-A-Service**\\n-------------------\\n\\nCloud infrastructure has a big role to play in making AI available to the masses, along with all the economic and social benefits that it’s expected to generate. AI models, such as the large language model (LLM) that powers ChatGPT, are trained on huge amounts of data, using vast amounts of compute power. Most businesses don’t have the resources to do this themselves, but by accessing AI-as-a-service through cloud platforms, they are able to leverage this powerful, transformative technology.\\n\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\n[![Image 2: Graphic Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1290x/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty_1-best-online-savings-thumbnail_101920pm.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\\n\\n### [Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-high-yield-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \\\"Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\\\")\\n\\nBy [Kevin Payne,](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/kevin-payne/) Contributor\\n\\n[![Image 3: Graphic Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/900x510/https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Saving-Rates-2.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23)\\n\\n### [Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/best-5-percent-interest-savings-accounts/?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=recirc&utm_campaign=tiger-sept23 \\\"Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\\\")\\n\\nBy [Cassidy Horton,](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/author/cassidy-horton) Contributor\\n\\n**Hybrid And Multi-Cloud**\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe number of large organizations with a multi-cloud strategy (i.e., they buy cloud services from more than one provider) is predicted to rise from 76% to 85% during 2024. It offers cost and flexibility advantages but adds complexity to data governance and integration with legacy systems. Multi and hybrid cloud (mixing cloud with on-premises infrastructure) are advanced infrastructure solutions that will continue to grow in popularity as organizations seek to balance security with flexibility and pick and choose the services they need.\\n\\n**Real-Time Cloud Infrastructure**\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring 2024, organizations will increasingly look to leverage real-time data in order to get up-to-the-minute insights rather than acting on outdated, stale information. At the same time, more and more of the data we consume will come in the form of streamed data – movies and music from Netflix and Spotify, video data from Zoom or Teams calls, and new forms of streamed entertainment such as cloud gaming. This means data storage that prioritizes instant access, such as Flash and solid-state storage devices, will become increasingly in demand by cloud customers.\\n\\n**Cloud-Driven Innovation And Transformation**\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs well as AI mentioned above, adopting cloud computing technology can be a gateway to many other transformative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and quantum computing. By eliminating the need to invest directly in architecture and infrastructure, businesses are able to launch quick-win/fail-fast initiatives to evaluate the benefits of emerging technologies more easily than ever in 2024, thanks to cloud computing.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Cloud Security And Resilience**\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nEncryption, authentication and disaster recovery are three functions of cloud computing services that will be increasingly in demand as we face up to the evolving threat landscape of 2024. Data thefts and breaches are increasing in frequency and severity as hackers develop new AI-powered forms of attack, and any system that has to be accessible to a human is always going to be at risk from social engineering attacks. This means security and resilience are high on the agenda of all cloud providers and customers.\\n\\n**Sustainable Cloud Computing**\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe big cloud service providers have all made net-zero commitments, not just for their own operations but in order to help customers who use their services to reduce their carbon footprints. Amazon has pledged to achieve zero emissions by 2040, and Microsoft aims to beat this by ten years. Along with Google, they have also all stated their intention to generate 100 percent of the energy used in their operations from renewable sources. Whether they make it remains to be seen, but the push for greener and less environmentally impactful cloud computing will be a strong trend in 2024.\\n\\n**Simplified Cloud Computing**\\n------------------------------\\n\\nToday, low-code/ no-code tools are opening up the possibility for non-technical people to create applications that previously would have required trained software engineers. Likewise, cloud providers are leveraging drag-and-drop interfaces and natural language tools to eliminate the need for advanced technical skills and “democratize” the deployment and management of cloud services and infrastructure.\\n\\n**Privacy In The Cloud**\\n------------------------\\n\\nCloud privacy refers to the ongoing development of technological, regulatory and legislative solutions designed to help businesses leverage cloud while ensuring their customers can trust that their data is fully protected. When a business uses a cloud service, it generally involves passing data to a third party – usually the cloud service provider. Managing the privacy implications of this will continue to be an important theme in cloud computing during 2024.\\n\\n**Serverless And Pay-As-You-Go Cloud**\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nServerless is a model of cloud computing service that eliminates the need for businesses to manage their own servers. While a typical cloud service might charge the business for the number of servers that they want to host their infrastructure on, under a serverless model, the business simply pays for the resources they directly use. This drives efficiency by eliminating the need to pay for servers even when they are not in use and frees up the business's time to spend on their core activities.\\n\\n**Edge Computing Everywhere**\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nEdge computing is a cloud-related paradigm in which information is processed as close as possible to the location where it’s collected. An example might be a wearable real-time heart monitor designed to pick up arrhythmias. As most of the data it collects would be “normal” heart rhythms, sending it all to the cloud for analysis, then back to the user to tell them everything is fine, would be a waste of bandwidth. Analyzing the data on the device itself eliminates this cost and also means the user can be alerted more quickly if anomalous data is detected. In 2024, smaller, more power-efficient processors, more memory-efficient algorithms, and advanced networks like 5G all contribute to making edge increasingly viable for a growing number of applications.\\n\\nYou can read more about future tech and business trends in my books_,_ [_The Future Internet: How the Metaverse, Web 3.0, and Blockchain Will Transform Business and Society_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Internet-Metaverse-Blockchain-Transform/dp/1119882877?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=wwwwapinstitu-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d9690561c9d20b8efda1b6fc9bd2963a&camp=1634&creative=6738 \\\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Internet-Metaverse-Blockchain-Transform/dp/1119882877?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=wwwwapinstitu-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d9690561c9d20b8efda1b6fc9bd2963a&camp=1634&creative=6738\\\"), [_Future Skills: The 20 Skills And Competencies Everyone Needs To Succeed In A Digital World_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Skills-Competencies-Succeed-Digital/dp/1119870402/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=c1if8&content-id=amzn1.sym.3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_p=3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_r=258-7709474-6614411&pd_rd_wg=6RpOB&pd_rd_r=6446b85f-d863-48b3-bbc4-a6ceb0a2773b&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk \\\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Skills-Competencies-Succeed-Digital/dp/1119870402/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=c1if8&content-id=amzn1.sym.3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_p=3413293e-3815-4359-96ba-1ec5110e0b30&pf_rd_r=258-7709474-6614411&pd_rd_wg=6RpOB&pd_rd_r=6446b85f-d863-48b3-bbc4-a6ceb0a2773b&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk\\\") and [_Business Trends in Practice_](https://bernardmarr.com/books/ \\\"https://bernardmarr.com/books/\\\"), which won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.

2024\\n====================================\\n\\nPosted on May 3, 2024\\n\\n_Member post by Sameer Danave, Senior Director of Marketing, [MSys Technologies](https://www.msystechnologies.com/)_\\n\\nEvery time I think I have this whole technology game down to a science, something changes in the blink of an eye. And if you’re as enthusiastic about the cloud as I am, you’ve likely experienced the same feeling of whiplash as cloud trends continue to shift.\\n\\nKeeping up with the latest technology trends isn’t always easy. However, to stay ahead of the competition, it’s pivotal to stay ahead of them.\\n\\nFortunately, I’ve gathered all the information you need on the latest cloud computing trends straight from industry experts and MSys’ survey of 400+ technology professionals and crafted a [Tech Lens 2024](https://www.msystechnologies.com/technology-trends-2024/)guide just for you. Let’s delve into the top five trends from this guide for 2024.\\n\\n**Top 5 Key Cloud Computing Trends to Watch**\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere are top five trends that are expected to witness significant traction in the forthcoming years.\\n\\n### **AI As A Service (AIaaS)**\\n\\nIn the forthcoming years, significant growth is foreseen in the integration of AI services into cloud solutions. Cloud infrastructure plays a crucial role in opening up AI’s economic and social benefits to enterprises. Training AI models, such as the robust large language model (LLM) powering ChatGPT, demands extensive data and substantial computing resources.\\n\\nEnterprises are shifting away from constructing their own AI infrastructure and opting for AI-as-a-service provided by cloud platforms. This transition allows them to harness the transformative power of AI without the constraints of managing resources. AI as a Service offers pre-built AI models, tools, and APIs hosted on cloud platforms, enabling enterprises to seamlessly implement AI functionalities, even without specialized AI expertise and infrastructure.\\n\\n### **Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Strategies**\\n\\nMulti-cloud and hybrid solutions have become incredibly popular among enterprises across the globe. The hybrid multi-cloud approach incorporates public cloud services from multiple providers, enabling portability across diverse cloud infrastructures. This enhances flexibility and reduces dependency on a single vendor, thus mitigating the risk of vendor lock-in.\\n\\nBesides, hybrid cloud solutions offer a flexible approach to managing data storage complexities. By integrating public and private cloud environments, organizations can leverage existing infrastructure while gaining scalability, security, and redundancy. This approach optimizes storage resource allocation, strengthens disaster recovery capabilities, and fosters agility in response to evolving business requirements.\\n\\nMoreover, hybrid cloud solutions provide enhanced control over IT infrastructure and bolstered security compared to alternative cloud options. Cloud vendors employ expert security professionals to ensure data protection, adhering to stringent protocols and compliance measures.\\n\\n### **Edge AI Computing**\\n\\nThe edge computing landscape is expected to witness significant traction in the forthcoming years. In the traditional cloud model, data transfers to a remote server for processing. In contrast, edge computing establishes a compact computing environment near the data source.\\n\\nThis reduces latency and enables real-time analysis and decision-making. The deployment of advanced networks like 5G, along with energy-efficient processors and algorithms, is expected to further bolster edge computing’s viability for evolving application needs by 2024.\\n\\n### **Sustainable Cloud Computing**\\n\\nSustainable computing is expected to experience significant growth in the years ahead. This trend is fueled by the understanding that approximately [1.8% to 3.9%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921001884) of global greenhouse gas emissions stem from the information and communication technology (ICT) sector.\\n\\nGreen computing encompasses environmentally conscious practices across the lifecycle of computers, chips, and other technology components, spanning from design and manufacturing to usage and disposal. Its objective is to mitigate environmental impact by decreasing carbon emissions and energy consumption across all stages, including production, data centers, and end-user operations.\\n\\nAdditionally, green computing involves the selection of sustainably sourced materials, minimizing electronic waste, and promoting sustainability through the use of renewable resources.\\n\\n### **Serverless Computing**\\n\\nExpected to see significant expansion with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of [23.17%](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/serverless-computing-market) between 2023 and 2028, serverless computing brings forth novel methods for creating and operating software applications and services. This emerging paradigm eradicates the necessity of infrastructure management, empowering users to write and deploy code devoid of the complexities of underlying systems.\\n\\nThis transition offers numerous benefits for developers, including quicker time-to-market, improved scalability, and decreased deployment costs for new services. As a result, developers can focus on innovation rather than the intricacies of managing infrastructure.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n--------------\\n\\nIn the whirlwind of technological advancement, keeping pace with cloud computing trends is both exhilarating and essential. Drawing from insights of industry experts and a survey of over 400 technology professionals by MSys, we’ve distilled the top five trends for 2024. From AI integration to sustainable practices and serverless architectures, these trends promise to reshape our approach to technology. By embracing them, we can propel our organizations forward and stay ahead of the competition. This guide offers actionable insights to navigate these trends effectively. Let’s embark on this journey together, pushing the boundaries of cloud computing’s possibilities.\\n\\n**About Sameer**\\n\\nSameer is a seasoned technology marketing professional with 16 years of full-stack marketing experience.

Use Cases and Best Practices**\\n\\n**15\\\\. Conclusion**\\n\\nAn accurate research report requires proper strategizing as well as implementation. There are multiple factors involved in the completion of good and accurate research report and selecting the best methodology to compete the research is the toughest part. Since the research reports we provide play a crucial role in any company’s decision-making process, therefore we at SNS Insider always believe that we should choose the best method which gives us results closer to reality. This allows us to reach at a stage wherein we can provide our clients best and accurate investment to output ratio.\\n\\nEach report that we prepare takes a timeframe of 350-400 business hours for production. Starting from the selection of titles through a couple of in-depth brain storming session to the final QC process before uploading our titles on our website we dedicate around 350 working hours. The titles are selected based on their current market cap and the foreseen CAGR and growth.\\n\\nThe 5 steps process:\\n\\n**Step 1: Secondary Research:**\\n\\nSecondary Research or Desk Research is as the name suggests is a research process wherein, we collect data through the readily available information. In this process we use various paid and unpaid databases which our team has access to and gather data through the same. This includes examining of listed companies’ annual reports, Journals, SEC filling etc. Apart from this our team has access to various associations across the globe across different industries. Lastly, we have exchange relationships with various university as well as individual libraries.\\n\\n![Image 7: Secondary Research](https://www.snsinsider.com/assets/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/info-res.jpg)\\n\\n**Step 2: Primary Research**\\n\\nWhen we talk about primary research, it is a type of study in which the researchers collect relevant data samples directly, rather than relying on previously collected data.  This type of research is focused on gaining content specific facts that can be sued to solve specific problems. Since the collected data is fresh and first hand therefore it makes the study more accurate and genuine.\\n\\nWe at SNS Insider have divided Primary Research into 2 parts.\\n\\nPart 1 wherein we interview the KOLs of major players as well as the upcoming ones across various geographic regions. This allows us to have their view over the market scenario and acts as an important tool to come closer to the accurate market numbers. As many as 45 paid and unpaid primary interviews are taken from both the demand and supply side of the industry to make sure we land at an accurate judgement and analysis of the market.\\n\\nThis step involves the triangulation of data wherein our team analyses the interview transcripts, online survey responses and observation of on filed participants. The below mentioned chart should give a better understanding of the part 1 of the primary interview.\\n\\n![Image 8: Primary Research](https://www.snsinsider.com/assets/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/research-methodology-3.jpg)\\n\\nPart 2: In this part of primary research the data collected via secondary research and the part 1 of the primary research is validated with the interviews from individual consultants and subject matter experts.\\n\\nConsultants are those set of people who have at least 12 years of experience and expertise within the industry whereas Subject Matter Experts are those with at least 15 years of experience behind their back within the same space. The data with the help of two main processes i.e., FGDs (Focused Group Discussions) and IDs (Individual Discussions). This gives us a 3rd party nonbiased primary view of the market scenario making it a more dependable one while collation of the data pointers.\\n\\n**Step 3: Data Bank Validation**\\n\\nOnce all the information is collected via primary and secondary sources, we run that information for data validation. At our intelligence centre our research heads track a lot of information related to the market which includes the quarterly reports, the daily stock prices, and other relevant information. Our data bank server gets updated every fortnight and that is how the information which we collected using our primary and secondary information is revalidated in real time.\\n\\n![Image 9: Data Bank Validation](https://www.snsinsider.com/assets/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/images/research-methodology-2.jpg)\\n\\n**Step 4: QA/QC Process**\\n\\nAfter all the data collection and validation our team does a final level of quality check and quality assurance to get rid of any unwanted or undesired mistakes. This might include but not limited to getting rid of the any typos, duplication of numbers or missing of any important information. The people involved in this process include technical content writers, research heads and graphics people. Once this process is completed the title gets uploader on our platform for our clients to read it.\\n\\n**Step 5: Final QC/QA Process:**\\n\\nThis is the last process and comes when the client has ordered the study. In this process a final QA/QC is done before the study is emailed to the client. Since we believe in giving our clients a good experience of our research studies, therefore, to make sure that we do not lack at our end in any way humanly possible we do a final round of quality check and then dispatch the study to the client.\\n\\n****Key Segments:****\\n\\n****By Service****\\n\\n*   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)\\n    \\n*   Platform as a Service (PaaS)\\n    \\n*   Software as a Service (SaaS)\\n    \\n\\n****By Enterprise Size****\\n\\n*   Large Enterprises\\n    \\n*   Small & Medium Enterprises\\n    \\n\\n****By Deployment****\\n\\n*   Public\\n    \\n*   Private\\n    \\n*   Hybrid\\n    \\n\\n****By Workload****\\n\\n*   Application Development & Testing\\n    \\n*   Data Storage & Backup\\n    \\n*   Resource Management\\n    \\n*   Orchestration Services\\n    \\n*   Others\\n    \\n\\n****By End-use****\\n\\n*   BFSI\\n    \\n*   IT & Telecom\\n    \\n*   Retail & Consumer Goods\\n    \\n*   Manufacturing\\n    \\n*   Energy & Utilities\\n    \\n*   Healthcare\\n    \\n*   Media & Entertainment\\n    \\n*   Government & Public Sector\\n    \\n*   Others\\n    \\n\\n****Request for Segment Customization as per your Business Requirement:**** [****Segment Customization Request****](https://www.snsinsider.com/enquiry/2779)\\n\\n****REGIONAL COVERAGE:****\\n\\nNorth America\\n\\n*   US\\n    \\n*   Canada\\n    \\n*   Mexico\\n    \\n\\nEurope\\n\\n*   Eastern Europe\\n    \\n    *   Poland\\n        \\n    *   Romania\\n        \\n    *   Hungary\\n        \\n    *   Turkey\\n        \\n    *   Rest of Eastern Europe\\n        \\n*   Western Europe\\n    \\n    *   Germany\\n        \\n    *   France\\n        \\n    *   UK\\n        \\n    *   Italy\\n        \\n    *   Spain\\n        \\n    *   Netherlands\\n        \\n    *   Switzerland\\n        \\n    *   Austria\\n        \\n    *   Rest of Western Europe\\n        \\n\\nAsia Pacific\\n\\n*   China\\n    \\n*   India\\n    \\n*   Japan\\n    \\n*   South Korea\\n    \\n*   Vietnam\\n    \\n*   Singapore\\n    \\n*   Australia\\n    \\n*   Rest of Asia Pacific\\n    \\n\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n\\n*   Middle East\\n    \\n    *   UAE\\n        \\n    *   Egypt\\n        \\n    *   Saudi Arabia\\n        \\n    *   Qatar\\n        \\n    *   Rest of the Middle East\\n        \\n\\n*   Africa\\n    \\n    *   Nigeria\\n        \\n    *   South Africa\\n        \\n    *   Rest of Africa\\n        \\n\\nLatin America\\n\\n*   Brazil\\n    \\n*   Argentina\\n    \\n*   Colombia\\n    \\n\\n****Request for Country Level Research Report:**** [****Country Level Customization Request****](https://www.snsinsider.com/enquiry/2779)\\n\\n****Available Customization****\\n\\nWith the given market data, SNS Insider offers customization as per the company’s specific needs.

As infrastructure matures and cloud strategies evolve, the focus has shifted toward selecting platforms that offer the right balance of performance, scalability, cost control, and innovation.\\n\\nWhile [AWS](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/aws-pricing-models/), [Microsoft Azure](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/microsoft-azure-pricing/), and [Google Cloud](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/google-cloud-pricing/) continue to dominate the market, many organizations are starting to explore multi-cloud architectures or reevaluate existing partnerships. Whether it’s for workload distribution, pricing leverage, regulatory compliance, or redundancy, understanding the broader cloud landscape is increasingly important.\\n\\nIn this guide, we’ll cover the top 9 cloud service providers in 2025, outlining what each one brings to the table and how to assess them based on your current and future infrastructure needs.\\n\\n1\\\\. Amazon Web Services (AWS)\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nAWS remains the dominant player in the cloud market, [holding 30% of the global cloud infrastructure](https://hginsights.com/blog/aws-market-report-buyer-landscape) share in 2025. Since launching in 2006, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) has built a vast ecosystem of over 200 services covering compute, storage, databases, analytics, and more.\\n\\nIts [global infrastructure](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/aws-global-infrastructure/) spans 31 regions (as of April 2025) and numerous Availability Zones, allowing businesses to deploy workloads close to users and reduce latency.\\n\\nThe platform caters to a wide spectrum of customers, from startups to large enterprises, across public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud setups. AWS continues to lead due to its platform maturity, global reach, and breadth of integrations.\\n\\nIts deep partner network and expansive marketplace also make it easier for businesses to extend functionality and integrate third-party solutions. [Pricing flexibility](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/aws-pricing-models/) remains a key benefit, with multiple models that allow organizations to align spend with usage and long-term commitments.\\n\\n2\\\\. Microsoft Azure\\n-------------------\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure has secured [20% of the global cloud infrastructure](https://hginsights.com/blog/aws-market-report-buyer-landscape) market by leveraging strong enterprise relationships and aligning closely with existing Microsoft ecosystems. Its appeal is rooted in how seamlessly it integrates with commonly used tools like Microsoft 365, Active Directory, and Windows Server, making it a natural choice for enterprises modernizing traditional IT infrastructure.\\n\\nAzure is especially well-positioned for hybrid cloud environments, enabling organizations to extend on-premises resources with cloud-native capabilities. Offerings like Azure Arc and Azure Stack have made it easier for companies to adopt cloud at their own pace while maintaining consistency across environments.\\n\\nWith a strong focus on compliance, governance, and enterprise-level security, Azure is often preferred by large organizations with complex operational and regulatory needs.\\n\\n3\\\\. Google Cloud\\n----------------\\n\\n[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en) distinguishes itself through its advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, all of which are right in line with Google’s expertise. Holding [12% of the global cloud infrastructure market](https://hginsights.com/blog/aws-market-report-buyer-landscape) in 2025. The platform is favored by organizations looking to modernize analytics pipelines, scale innovation, or work with AI-based systems.\\n\\nIts architecture is built around performance, efficiency, and a developer-first mindset. While it started with a strong appeal to tech-forward teams and startups, Google Cloud has expanded its enterprise offerings and compliance capabilities to attract larger, more traditional organizations as well.\\n\\nIts global network provides high-speed, low-latency access, and the platform’s pricing transparency and support for open-source tools contribute to its growing adoption across industries.\\n\\nIf you want to compare the big three, our blog can help: [AWS vs. Google Cloud vs. Azure: A Detailed Breakdown](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/google-cloud-vs-aws-vs-azure/)\\n\\n4\\\\. IBM Cloud\\n-------------\\n\\n[IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) has established itself as a leading provider of enterprise-grade cloud solutions with a focus on hybrid cloud environments and AI capabilities.\\n\\nIBM’s acquisition of Red Hat has further enhanced its hybrid capabilities, allowing customers to deploy and manage applications consistently across public and private infrastructure. Rather than competing directly with hyperscale providers in volume, IBM Cloud differentiates by supporting highly regulated, legacy-integrated environments that demand stability and governance.\\n\\nThus, IBM Cloud stands out with its strong security features, reliable performance, and industry-specific solutions that meet more rigid compliance needs.\\n\\n5\\\\. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) has gained momentum by focusing on high-performance computing, database services, and enterprise applications.\\n\\nOCI’s architecture is designed for critical workloads, offering consistently high performance, strong isolation, and comprehensive security. The platform is great for running Oracle’s enterprise applications and databases, whether you’re working in a multi, hybrid, or dedicated cloud environment.\\n\\nAnd while OCI is a viable choice for organizations that already rely heavily on Oracle’s software, the company has expanded to offer a full range of cloud services.\\n\\n6\\\\. DigitalOcean Cloud\\n----------------------\\n\\n[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) has carved out a niche for itself by offering simplified cloud infrastructure for developers, startups, and small- to medium-sized businesses. The platform emphasizes ease of use, transparent pricing, and developer-friendly features that reduce the complexity often associated with larger cloud providers.\\n\\nWith its straightforward virtual machines (called “[Droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets)“), managed Kubernetes service, and object storage solutions, DigitalOcean provides the building blocks for application development and deployment. This simplicity speeds up development cycles and makes it easier for teams with limited cloud experience to get up and running.\\n\\n7\\\\. Alibaba Cloud\\n-----------------\\n\\n[Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en?_p_lc=7) is popular in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, where it holds the largest market share. As the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, it uses the company’s e-commerce expertise to provide specialized services for online retail and digital commerce.\\n\\nAlibaba Cloud has proven it can handle large-scale operations, like the billions of transactions processed during Alibaba’s annual Singles’ Day shopping event. That event alone shows it’s more than capable of managing heavy workloads, making it optimal for businesses operating in Asia or needing global cloud coverage with a strong focus on Asian markets.\\n\\nThat said, Alibaba Cloud _has_ expanded globally with data centers across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. It offers a suite of cloud-based services for these markets, including cloud computing services, cloud storage, databases, big data, AI, and security solutions.\\n\\n8\\\\. Salesforce Cloud\\n--------------------\\n\\nSalesforce has evolved from solely a CRM provider to an impressive cloud powerhouse for customer engagement. [Salesforce Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/sales/cloud/) includes Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, and the underlying platform services that power these applications.\\n\\nSalesforce’s primary draw is its focus on business applications rather than infrastructure services, providing intelligent automation and insights that enhance customer experiences. The platform excels at providing ready-to-use solutions for customer relationship management, marketing automation, ecommerce, and analytics, all integrated within a single ecosystem.\\n\\n9\\\\. Tencent Cloud\\n-----------------\\n\\n[Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) rounds out our list as another global player, building on Tencent’s experience in gaming, social media, and digital entertainment. While particularly strong in China, [Tencent Cloud has expanded internationally](https://www.tencentcloud.com/dynamic/news-details/100496), with data centers across Asia, North America, Europe, and South America.\\n\\nTencent Cloud largely deals in media services, content delivery, and real-time communication solutions, making it a good option for gaming companies, streaming services, and applications requiring low-latency interactions. And Tencent Cloud’s experience supporting massive platforms like WeChat demonstrates its ability to handle enormous scale.\\n\\nKey Considerations for Choosing Your Cloud Service Provider\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSelecting the right cloud service provider (CSP) requires more than comparing features or pricing tiers. It’s about aligning the provider’s strengths with your organization’s technical requirements, operating model, and long-term business goals. Below are the most important factors to evaluate when making that decision:\\n\\n*   **Performance and reliability**: Assess the provider’s history with uptime, latency, and infrastructure resilience. Look into their global data center footprint and availability zones — especially in regions where you operate — to ensure your applications run close to your end users with minimal performance degradation.\\n*   **Security and compliance standards**: Another priority consideration should be the provider’s security capabilities, compliance certifications, and data protection measures. Especially if you’re in a heavily regulated industry, you need to make sure the cloud service provider (CSP) meets your specific compliance requirements.\\n*   **Cost and** **pricing** **model transparency**: Compare [total cost of ownership](https://www.prosperops.com/blog/cloud-tco/) across providers, not just list prices. Look for clear documentation, transparent billing practices, and native tools for tracking and managing cloud spend. Understand how costs scale with usage, and whether pricing models (pay-as-you-go vs. discount instruments) suit your workload patterns.\\n*   **Licensing costs:** Licensing fees can significantly impact your overall cloud bill, particularly for workloads running on proprietary software or commercial databases. Some providers bundle licensing into their pricing, while others require separate agreements. For Linux users or organizations running open-source stacks, licensing flexibility can reduce costs, but for enterprise software (e.g., Windows Server, Oracle), licensing structures may vary widely across CSPs.\\n*   **Scalability** **and flexibility**: How easily can the platform scale to accommodate growth in users, traffic, or data? How well can it handle peak loads and seasonal variations in demand? If you’re in a seasonal-based business, this is an especially important consideration.\\n*   **Service offerings and ecosystem compatibility**: Review the maturity, reliability, and depth of services offered, especially in areas like storage, networking, DevOps, databases, and analytics. Also consider compatibility with your current tech stack, development frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines.\\n*   **Multi-cloud** **and** **hybrid cloud** **support**: How well does the provider support multi-cloud strategies and hybrid deployments? Consider their tools and services for managing workloads across diverse environments, especially if you’re operating in a more complex setup.\\n*   **Data residency and global infrastructure coverage**: Look into the provider’s global presence and whether they can meet data sovereignty rules in the areas you operate. Also, inquire about any plans for expanding into emerging markets.\\n*   **Vendor lock-in and migration complexity**: Analyze how difficult it would be to migrate away from the provider if needed. Choose tools that support open standards and portable technologies to avoid getting stuck with one provider.\\n*   **Managed services** **and support availability**: Consider the level of managed services and the quality of tech support. Read reviews from other users and consider how their experiences may impact your cloud implementation and use cases. Check out the support tiers, response times, and availability in the regions where you operate.\\n*   **Innovation and emerging technology integrations**: Assess the provider’s investment in emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, and edge computing. Consider their track record for innovation and new service development and how their future-looking perspectives align with your future business goals.\\n\\nOptimize Cloud Costs Automatically With ProsperOps\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 33](https://www.prosperops.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/prosperopscloudoptimization-1024x536.png)\\n\\nAs cloud adoption grows, so does the complexity of managing spend, especially across multiple services, regions, and pricing models.

Consider this:\\n\\n*   About two-thirds of respondents currently operate in a public cloud, and 45% use a private cloud, versus 55% who still rely on traditionally managed on-premises systems.\\n*   48% plan to migrate at least half of their applications to the cloud in the next year; 20% intend to move all their applications to the cloud.\\n*   47% are pursuing a cloud-first strategy, 30% are already cloud-native, and 37% intend to become cloud-native in about three years.\\n*   Only 5% plan on switching from the cloud to on-premises infrastructure (cloud repatriation).\\n\\n### 60% of organizations are running over half of their workloads in the cloud (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nThis marks a steady climb from 39% in 2022. Cloud-first and hybrid strategies continue to grow as businesses move more core operations to cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n### Cloud adoption among enterprise organizations is over 94% (Source: RightScale)\\n\\nMore than 94% of organizations with over 1,000 employees have a significant portion of their workloads in the cloud, according to a survey of 800 organizations. The latest edition shows enterprise cloud computing continues to grow rapidly — and then some. For example:\\n\\n*   More enterprises are exploring a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud approach rather than just using a public or private cloud strategy. More on this later.\\n*   54% will move their workloads to the public cloud in the next 12 months.\\n\\nThere’s more.\\n\\n### Organizations with 1,000 or fewer staff invest big in the cloud (Source: TechRepublic)\\n\\nAbout 44% of traditional small businesses use cloud infrastructure or hosting services. That’s compared to 66% of small tech companies and 74% of enterprises.\\n\\nThere is one more thing. The public cloud will host 63% of SMB workloads and 62% of SMB data within the next year.\\n\\n### The U.S. and Western Europe still dominate cloud computing (Source: ReportLinker)\\n\\nCombined, these two regions account for 82% of the world’s cloud computing. This chart shows cloud adoption by country and region according to Gartner:\\n\\n![Image 5: Growth in IT spending on public cloud services](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/growth-in-it-spending-on-public-cloud-services.webp)\\n**_Credit:_**_Gartner 2022_\\n\\n### 40% of organizations in developing regions are currently evaluating and planning cloud strategies (Oracle and IDC)\\n\\nThe cloud computing industry is not just booming in developed economies. According to new Oracle findings, cloud computing is rapidly developing in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as well as in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).\\n\\nCurrently, 30% of respondents report using the cloud. Among companies with more than 2,500 employees, half are planning or evaluating cloud strategies as are 41% of those with 1,000 to 2,500 employees.\\n\\n### Cloud Computing is becoming more popular across lines of business teams (Oracle and IDC)\\n\\nLines of business (LoBs) are even more involved (40%) than IT (38%). That’s a good thing. Both units are leveraging the cloud’s power in different areas of their organizations more than they used to.\\n\\nWhy Are Companies Adopting Cloud Computing So Fast?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOrganizations are [moving to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/solutions/migration) for a variety of compelling reasons. Cloud computing offers several powerful benefits, including:\\n\\n### Cloud computing boosts gross margins and profitability (Source: Wipro FullStride)\\n\\nIn its global survey of 1,300 C-Suite executives, Wipro FullStride Cloud Services showed that a well-executed move to digital increased revenue and [profitability](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/saas-gross-margin).\\n\\nWhile SaaS companies reported the highest margins, others also enjoyed notable gains. As an example, finance executives reported revenue increases of up to 15% and profitability increases of up to 4%.\\n\\nAnother survey by Deloitte showed small and medium businesses that used cloud computing made 21% more profit and grew 26% faster.\\n\\n### Cloud computing generates more revenue (Source: Infosys)\\n\\nThe survey also noted that [migrating to the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-migration) helps unlock additional revenue streams that can boost profit growth by as much as 11.2% year-over-year.\\n\\nHere’s the kicker. The survey concluded that your organization needs at least 60% of its workload in the cloud to realize noteworthy financial gains.\\n\\n### Achieve faster time to market (Source: IBM)\\n\\nSome 65% of respondents who identified as “Optimizers” told IBM that cloud computing helped them reduce time to market.

Public Infrastructure as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform as-a-Service (PaaS) services account for the bulk of the market.\\n\\n“While the growth is broad based across geographies and services, clearly AI is making a big difference,” said Dinsdale. “We saw growth of [between] 140 percent to 160 percent in GenAI-specific services, with AI also contributing to service enhancements and added growth across the broader portfolio. The capex numbers are huge, but so are the incremental revenues.”\\n\\nHere are the [cloud market share](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/cloud-market-share-in-q2-microsoft-drops-google-gains-aws-remains-leader \\\"cloud market share\\\") figures for AWS, [Alibaba](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/cloud-giant-alibaba-invests-53b-in-ai-infrastructure-as-stock-surges \\\"Alibaba\\\"), Google, Microsoft and [Oracle](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2025/oracle-disclosed-breach-of-legacy-environment-to-customers-report \\\"Oracle\\\") for the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\n![Image 5](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/media_12f48e61e66096c9a2f4797451b113622d1b1d338.png?width=750&format=png&optimize=medium)\\n\\n**No. 5: Oracle**\\n\\n**Q1 2025 Market Share: 3 Percent**\\n\\n**Q4 2024 Market Share: 3 Percent**\\n\\n**Q1 2024 Market Share: 2 Percent**\\n\\nOracle ranks No. 5 in the global cloud infrastructure services market by winning 3 percent share during the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\nIn March, the Austin, Texas-based company reported total cloud revenue of $6.2 billion for first quarter of calendar year 2025.

      "\n",
      "Provide a comprehensive competitive intelligence report on top cloud providers including AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, IBM, and other key regional players. The analysis should cover market share by region, service offerings categorized by cloud model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), key strategic differentiators, partnerships, recent investments and mergers & acquisitions (M&A), and pricing strategies. The competitive landscape should also explore differences in competition between western and emerging markets and evaluate local players' market presence and adaptation approaches.\n",

      "## Research Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Market Share Overview and Regional Presence\n",
      "\n",
      "- **AWS** remains the world’s largest cloud infrastructure provider, holding about **29-30% of the global market share** in early 2025, despite a slight recent decline from 31-33% in previous years. It boasts a vast global infrastructure with **31 regions and numerous Availability Zones** spread worldwide, which allows for low-latency deployments globally.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Microsoft Azure** holds approximately **20-22% global market share**, positioning second globally. It is especially strong in hybrid cloud adoption due to its integration with enterprise Microsoft tools. Azure enjoys strong market positions in North America and Europe due to mature infrastructure and enterprise relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Google Cloud (GCP)** has gained ground to approximately **12% global market share**, demonstrating steady growth by focusing on AI, machine learning, data analytics, and developer-centric platforms. GCP is popular among tech-forward enterprises and startups, with growing enterprise adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Alibaba Cloud** holds around **4% global market share**, dominating the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, leveraging its e-commerce heritage. Alibaba has expanded globally with data centers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tencent Cloud** captures approximately **2% global market share**, mostly strong in China and selectively expanding internationally, with focus on gaming, real-time communication, and media services.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **IBM Cloud** and **Oracle Cloud** each control about **2-3% global market share**, with IBM focusing on hybrid cloud environments and regulated industries, boosted by its Red Hat acquisition. Oracle is focused on high-performance computing, databases, and enterprise apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Regional players in emerging markets such as **Huawei Cloud** (China), **DigitalOcean** (developer and SMB niche globally), and local incumbents vary but generally hold smaller shares regionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The combined market share of the top three (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) amounts to around **60-63% globally** by early 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In **western markets** (U.S., Europe), AWS, Azure, and Google dominate with extensive infrastructure, comprehensive service breadth, and strong enterprise relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "- In **emerging markets** (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa), Alibaba and Tencent lead in Asia, while local players and clouds from global providers aim to expand with tailored regional approaches including compliance with data sovereignty laws.\n",

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The leading cloud service providers globally are AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, controlling about two-thirds of the cloud infrastructure market share by early 2025. AWS remains the largest but has experienced a slight market share decrease amid strong competition. Azure leverages robust enterprise integration and hybrid cloud leadership, while Google Cloud gains traction through AI and developer focus. Alibaba Cloud dominates Asia with an emphasis on digital commerce, and Tencent Cloud plays a key role in gaming and media industries, mainly in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service offerings across all providers span the core cloud models— IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS—each provider differentiates through its ecosystem, AI capabilities, hybrid cloud solutions, and specialization in industry verticals or regional markets. Pricing models uniformly offer flexibility but differ in discounts, billing transparency, and enterprise agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competition dynamics differ regionally: western markets see dominance by AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with hybrid/multi-cloud prevalent, while emerging markets favor regional incumbents with adaptations to local regulatory and infrastructure realities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategic investments in AI, data analytics, edge computing, and sustainable infrastructure underpin growth, as providers fortify their capabilities through M&A, partnerships, and infrastructure expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations choosing a cloud service provider must weigh global reach, service breadth, compliance, pricing flexibility, ecosystem partnerships, and regional presence to align cloud strategies with business needs.\n",
