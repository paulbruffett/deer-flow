Downtime is unacceptably costly in today’s business environment.\\n\\nFor enterprises, the cost can be wildly higher.\\n\\n### A single hour of downtime costs enterprises over $100,000 (Source: Accenture)\\n\\nThat is according to nearly all (98%) of surveyed leaders. Some 40% of enterprises said they lost $1-$5 million in just one hour of downtime. This eye-watering cost excludes legal fees, fines, or penalties.\\n\\nAdd Service Level Agreement (SLA) obligations and other forms of inconveniences and business losses, and you are looking at even larger damage.\\n\\n### Misconfiguration is responsible for 68% of issues (Source: Fortinet)\\n\\nOrganizations ranked the following threats as the most significant security threats to their public clouds:\\n\\n*   Misconfiguration (68%)\\n*   Unauthorized access (58%)\\n*   Insecure interfaces (52%)\\n*   Hijacking of accounts (50%)\\n\\nMeanwhile, most apps have fewer than three security certifications, while IT-owned apps are more likely to utilize single sign-on (SSO). Similarly, many organizations had not prioritized cybersecurity and compliance:\\n\\n![Image 32: Cybersecurity and compliance](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cybersecurity-and-compliance-1.webp)\\n### Zero trust policies are a thing now (Source: Fortnet)\\n\\nMore organizations are implementing zero trust policies to improve their cloud security, according to Fortinet. Consider this:\\n\\n![Image 33: Zero Trust Policies](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zero-trust-policies.webp)\\n_What organizations hope implementing zero trust policies will achieve._\\n\\nTop Cloud Concerns For Decision-Makers\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nApart from cloud security concerns, organizations pointed to several other issues as the biggest unforeseen factors that slow or stop cloud adoption.\\n\\n### Managing costs is the biggest challenge to cloud adoption (Source: Flexera)\\n\\nAmong those surveyed for the State of the Cloud Report, managing cloud costs and security were the main reasons for not fully embracing cloud computing. This is true for both enterprises and SMBs.\\n\\n![Image 34: Top cloud challenges](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/top-cloud-challenges.webp)\\n**_Credit_**_: State of the Cloud Report for 2023_\\n\\nIn addition, enterprises and SMBs experience issues with acquiring expertise and managing compliance in the cloud, respectively.\\n\\n### Low visibility is a major barrier to cloud adoption (Source: Fortnet)\\n\\nAccording to findings in the 2022 Cybersecurity Insiders Report by Fortinet, cloud adoption limitations include:\\n\\n*   Lack of visibility (49%)\\n*   High cost (43%)\\n*   Lack of control (42%)\\n*   Lack of staff resources or expertise (39%)\\n*   Lack of security (22%)\\n\\nA major obstacle to controlling cloud costs is not getting “true visibility” into costs:\\n\\n![Image 35: Top challenges to controlling cloud costs](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/top-challenges-to-controlling-cloud-costs.webp)\\n**_Credit:_**_Anodot_\\n\\n### Integration issues cause governance challenges (Source: PwC)\\n\\nThe US Cloud Business Survey by PwC reported that a lack of integration with existing systems, insufficient talent, and a lack of expertise are other top challenges to adopting cloud computing.\\n\\n![Image 36: Talent concerns among key barriers to realizing cloud value](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/talent-concerns-among-key-barriers-to-realizing-cloud-value.webp)\\nThere is more.\\n\\n### SaaS companies are moving away from massive discounting (OpenView Venture Capital)\\n\\nA good 68% of SaaS companies are discounting their prices in less than a quarter of all deals, according to the State of SaaS Pricing report.\\n\\n![Image 37: SaaS companies discounts](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/saas-companies-discounts.webp)\\nA further 29% report that their sales team offers “very little discounting _._” This is helping them generate more revenues and maintain their margins.\\n\\n**But what if you want to encourage new subscriptions and renewals?**\\n\\nThe problem may not have been discounting. They may have been unsure how much discount to offer — especially without hurting their margins. We recommend you [use cost per customer](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/measure-cost-per-customer) to determine how much you spend to support a specific customer — like this:\\n\\n![Image 38: CloudZero platform overview](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CloudZero-Platform-Overview-2.webp)\\nThis information can help you pinpoint how much you can discount that particular customer without compromising your margins on their contract.\\n\\nWhat Are The Top Cloud Computing Initiatives In 2025?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn response to those challenges, many organizations have or are implementing initiatives to counter them. Here are some top cloud computing statistics that show how.\\n\\n### Serverless adoption has surpassed 75% in 2025 (Source: Datadog, AWS Heroes)\\n\\nOver 70% of AWS users now rely on Lambda. Google Cloud Run use has quadrupled since 2020. Azure’s serverless usage jumped 76% in one year, driven by container-based platforms.\\n\\n### 78% of organizations are making cloud cost optimization their top priority in 2025 (Source: Flexera)\\n\\nFlexera’s latest report shows most companies aim to reduce cloud waste. They also want better cost visibility and plan to move more workloads to SaaS and public cloud.\\n\\n### Organizations want to use cloud computing to meet ESG goals (Source: PwC)\\n\\nSome companies are leveraging cloud computing to meet their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.
